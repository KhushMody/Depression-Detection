2,I feel like i can't go on anymore,"I've hit rock bottom multiple times in my life, but currently, I feel like I can't go on anymore. I recovered from a tough phase, things are looking brighter, yet i can't feel actual happiness anymore. I cry my eyes out every single night, because I just want everything to end, yet i can't leave my family and pet behind. I started drinking two weeks ago, and even contemplated slamming my antidepressants with rum. I don't want to go to the psych ward again, as it's only a temporary fix for my issues. I'm starting to believe that there's only one way out, and I tried convincing people close to me that it's the only way to end my problems, but to no avail. Why can't I decide for myself when my journey ends? I just want to be understood, and my decision respected. My mind is just all over the place at the moment. I just need someone to talk to right now.",1682110011.0
3,Cannot stop crying,"I also have problems with memory gaps. So today I'm aware I have been crying and stopping for moments. But I have not been able to do anything productive, neither watch a movie or end a draw.

What I can remember it's cry desesperate, stop a minutes, evade myself, try to do something productive and repeat the cycle. During all the day.

And now I have found that 12 hours ago I writted how much I hated to cry and how my noise have started to bleed.",1682104902.0

5,The things we should do are the things we don't want to do.,"Any professionals out there, why is it the things that we should do to help our depression are the things we least want to do? For example exercise, meditation, socialization etc.",1682095753.0
6,I feel like the only way I'll feel normal is being under some kind of drug,"I guess I am just disappointed that I feel like I am only enthusiastic for life for a few brief hours when I'm under some drug. Otherwise, anxiety clouds over me completely and everything becomes depressing. Weed or my microdosed ketamine is the only thing that makes me feel okay again. I am in good physical health and exercise at least 3 times a week, as well as I have practiced meditation for a decent while now. I guess I will take it as a positive that anything can make me feel better at all, but it still kind of just sucks. My antidepressants help, and I'm looking to increase the dose when I can. But yeah, most of the time I only enjoy my existence when a drug mutes out the other stuff. I feel like I've tried all other advice under the sun. I've read so many articles, studied so many books and videos, and in the end I feel like I'm back right where I started. It is high functioning depression, as I can still do everything I need to do, but fuck man it just sucks straight up. :/",1682107948.0
7,please tell me it's gonna be alright,I have been dealing with depression for a long time. My boss said they are totally fine without me when asked for a raise after putting effort. They give newer employees 1.5x-3x my salary. I have started spiralling back again,1682118768.0
8,I don’t get why Selena Gomez hasn’t recovered from bipolar depression despite being in treatment for years,"
She said she has been in treatment for bipolar depression also known as bipolar disorder since 2019, but said in her new documentary that she is not doing ok mentally. According to my research bipolar disorder/bipolar depression is caused by low or high levels of chemicals in the brain. If they were to give her drugs like lithium to balance out her chemicals, she will recover",1682117238.0
9,Suicidal in foreign country.,"#TriggerWarning-SuicideAttempt-

I'm an American on vacation in west Africa with my wife whom I met while she was studying in the USA. I came to her county after she graduated to meet her family. I paid for the flight one way in order to save money. I don't have a lot and thought it help me save money to bring here. I was planning to stay 3 months. I've been here two already. But I still don't have the funds for an emergency ticket. 

I have bipolar disorder and now in a dépressive épisode. Unfortunately, it already took a turn for the worst. As I've already attempted to take my life once.  My wife found me unconscious. And her brother rushed me to the hospital. I woke up after about a day.

I've spoken to the United States embassy to try to get help with getting back home but the consultant was very rude and dismissive which, for those who deal with this type of illness knows makes it worse and makes asking for any help more painful.

I'm at a loss of what to do as all I can think about is why didn't I die the first time and how not to mess up again. Although, at the same time. I do love my wife and don't want to upset her anymore because she is the only one who's ever truly loved me. But this pain is so unbearable. Now I'm even more ashamed and guilty than before.

I don't know what to do. Why am I like this?",1682102207.0
10,My friend has gone into a major depressive episode,"My friend who has often said they hate doing nothing and how shitty it makes them feel and who has admitted that they never ask for help when they need it has asked for space, they have had space for a week or so where we just text occasionally. I feel the space isn't helping them and they say they feel the exact same, in a bid to try and help themselves they are tying to relax by doing absolutely nothing all day on their own with there thoughts.

We have often compared how we think as we are very simular and I know if I was alone my thoughts and overthinking would destroy me as they often do.

They have also said they do not have the energy to talk to people and have asked occasionally not to be text as its overwhelming. 

Do I just give the space and back off or do I do something? As I feel strongly what they ate dping is making them feel worse but at the end of the day I don't understand depression and have tried to de research but I can't figure out if it's best to just back off or if its better to do something rather than watch as they self destruct as they are hiding all emotions and have gone worse since they have tried to help themselves their way. 

Advice on what it's best for me to do?",1682097462.0
11,Todays Inspiration: I finally got back to work! Bipolar 1 Warrior,"I feel like today I have a success story to share. I was unemployed for three years because of my diagnosis and issues related to mental health obviously. I went back to work full time and ended up working overtime and crashing after 6 months at a tech company in Silicon Valley. That was 2019. Last year had two failed work attempts. This year I was fortunate because I lost all support. No unemployment disability no family no friends, church won't even give me a dollar. I escaped an abusive situation late January and I moved to Thailand. I decided I was gonna work one hour a day on small projects (5-50$ per task) and that I would find the cheapest apartment. Fast forward today, I'm making $35 an hour, I have three clients coming back to me and giving me 5 stars and more projects. Now I'm working 3 to 4 hours a day with lots of breaks and saving my money for my next travel adventure. However currently I'm just covering myself month to month. I'm saving money by not doing manicures pedicures buying anything I already have. I'm a freelancer research for Tech such participant recruitment. I find small projects on up work. And sometimes I need a week off and I take it and my clients have been nice about that.

My whole life I've been told I need to work and take care of myself and make money, it was normal to be working 20 to 60 hours a week with a huge expectation that you're working full time once you're an adult out of University. I knew that I needed to stop working after psychosis. I knew that my mind and body needed a break to understand what my therapist is saying what is CBT what is DBT how do I sleep normal, have to cook and feed myself and go shopping and do responsibilities. It's like somebody who's lost their ability to speak because of a concussion or their ability to walk because of an accident they have to relearn it again. I knew I needed to be forgiving and kind to my body and my mind and never speak bad to myself. My mind was very slow and didn't want to learn. If you guys can move and work less and genuinely dedicate time to therapy journaling and self improvement, I believe you can crawl out of any type of abuse depression or mania.

I religiously take my medication and go to my appointments. However that's not enough to keep me functioning and feeling good and taking care of my brain throughout the day. If you feel like you don't know what to do or you don't have money, just go volunteer somewhere, housing is paid for in food and you get a stipend. I have two master degrees but I decided to work at Starbucks because I knew that I needed social interaction to get over the fear because of the abuse I suffered from my exes and family. and work. after just three months working 4 hours a day I made so many new friends, and I remembered most people's orders the next day. After that my mind became sharper and I gained energy even though I was depressed. That's when I got hired at Tech and worked full time.

I paid $350 for a luxury apartment with a pool and gym. I spend about 100 to 150 on food per month. About 100 a month for visa because Thailand is weird about that. I do have to pay for medications out of pocket about 100. That's about $650 usd per month and and my room for rent in Silicon Valley was 1200 a month if you wanted to live close to work. It's possible to Travel for free on the couch surfing app and become a house sitter, I've met many nomads in the last 10 years and they enjoy the freedom from being able to survive on human kindness and hospitality all around the world. People would tell me that they would get money and people would give them their extra cell phones if theirs was broken, they would always cook for them or they would let you cook for them and you can help clean their home and spend time with them. Hitchhiking has become a little bit safer in certain countries and areas. So don't let money be a factor preventing you from doing anything new.

If I wanted to I would only need to work two or three hours every few days to cover the small amount. But now I'm working more to save but still it's just two to three hours per day it doesn't compare to the massive amount of work that I did in Tech 8 to 10 hours a day, where I'm eating while I'm working and responding to calls while I'm driving to work. I'm never gonna do that again.

Your life is so precious, it's important to regain the power to do whatever we want on this planet when we want and with who we want or don't want in our lives. You can pack up and leave right now if you need to get hospitalized first do some rehab and then find a place to live so that you know that you have support and medical attention. However just changing your job or hobbies that you absolutely always wanted to do, just writing down go hiking is not gonna excite you. If you always wanted to be a live stream DJ, now is the time to partner with the right DJ 's online and just get it started. It's easier now more than ever in all of history to do so many different things and different jobs. So it can be overwhelming to have so many options but it only takes a few days sitting with yourself wondering what's on your favorite bucket list to get this started. I believe in myself that I can crawl out of bed and do things that will make me happy today and take care of my body mind and soul. I hope that this helped anybody know that you're not alone and that there is a way to live with the symptoms of depression and overcome them with all of the amazing tools we have today. Be brave, virtual hugs.",1682075751.0

My marriage is falling apart. My job as a military recruiter is awful. 

I find myself to be angry, all of the time. Absolutely rage full. 
I don’t want to hurt myself or other. But I feel like I want to tear things apart. I feel like I want to destroy everything I can get my hands on. I feel like I want to blow up on everything and everyone. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t get therapy because appointments are booked for a while. I work 14 hour days, 7 days a week. I don’t know how much longer I can keep feeling

15,Ways to handle it,"Female, 23, have been diagnosed with moderate depression and anxiety last autumn. Since then have been taking Sertraline and Tofisopam. It seems to get better, even the side effects don’t bother me much, but the thing is that I don’t get psychological support enough. There were two times I’ve seen a psychologist at the clinic: one in autumn, and another one a week ago. I used to do online therapy sessions with my psychologist but in winter I gave it up. 
I know there’s still some stuff to work on so I don’t know what should I do. Right now I’m struggling with:
- cleaning my apartment 
- procrastinating although being aware of consequences 
- anxiety about future unemployment and financial issues
- time management 
- waking up early and being productive right from the start

I work from about 2 until 8-10 pm practically every day, in the morning I either study or work or do some chores around the town. I don’t have money to afford a gym pass or psychology sessions right now cause I’m saving up for the future. So, any advices on activities that can motivate you or help you feel better?

16,Know it won’t change over next decades,"So I am in a world of regret right now, regretting every life decision, especially the past years where I messed everything up in a big way. Selling houses I miss so much, not doing things right for my kids, etc. The thing is I’m already in so much regret and hurt and depression now I can’t function.  But I try to go minute to minute. But the thing is I picture myself 10, 20, 30 years from now, should that happen and the regret is still going to be there.  Probably worse because I’ll be old and alone. And have the next ten years of things to regret too.",1682090751.0
17,I have no idea what to do with my life,"To put it plainly-I'm a loser. I've never had a job, I have no friends, I've never been in a relationship. I was homeschooled as a kid and I feel like an absolute moron compared to other people my age.  Years of isolation have given me severe social anxiety and my mind feels like its turned to gravy. I don't leave my house unless I forced to. And when I do, I feel like an alien trying to blend in with other people. I feel disconnected from reality.

After I graduated high school, I spent two years living like a hermit in my parents house-doing nothing. I enrolled in my local community college a few months back. But I dropped out after four weeks after getting increasingly bored with my major. Now, I'm back to just languishing in my parents house-doing nothing.

I turned 20 last November. It's April now and I dread spending another year cooped up in my parents house like I'm Boo Radley. I try to do little things to 'improve' my life; I attempt to read more books, I workout. But it doesn't take away the feeling of failure and disappointment. Other people my age are trying to make something of themselves. Many have already graduated college. Some have already married and are starting families. I have no interest in any major or career. I barely have any interest in anything. 

So, I guess what I asking is for some way out of this cycle. I feel like I'm stuck in this life until my mom finally throws me out the house and I'll be forced to make a choice. I feel like if I don't do something soon I'm on the verge of mentally snapping.",1682052788.0

19,No longer being able to enjoy my hobbies,"Hello everyone. I've been suffering from depression for a few years now. It started after my horrible childhood, loneliness and other unrelated illnesses crept up to me. 

Anyways, I am way better now than I was some years ago but still I am not cured. I especially struggle with enjoying my past hobbies - notably reading and watching shows/anime. Anything which my brain can consider pretty sad can spiral me into a mini depressive episodes. I hate this, I want to be able to enjoy myself! I don't want to be limited by my stupid, broken brain.... Do anyone of you know what can I do in this situation?

Besides that I feel that next depressive episode is approaching soon. I'm trying to distract myself but I don't know if I will be able to stop it. Any tips? Thanks!",1682028150.0
20,How to move on,"Hey. I'll keep it short because I'm in a rush. 
For the last year's I've been in a depression. I've realized now I was just feeling lonely, but I always blamed it on my studies (well, there's part of true in that: I wanted to take a gap year after HS, I didn't and it affected my mindset when starting uni). 
Now I think know what I want to do in life (or at least one possiblity that I like?) but I was so depressed I didn't work as much as I know I could've and, while I can still take that path, I know deep down it'd be a waste to follow it right away knowing I haven't been reading as much as I could have.

All these years I've been stuck in the past, ruminating about how I should've taken the gap year and how that has affected my mindset and my university experience and my life. Now I can't stop thinking about how it also affected my readings and how I'm not prepared to take that path. 

When I'm more ""present""  it's fine, I take action and read. But I feel I'm in a rush now because of all these years. I'm graduating and, although I'm welcome at my parents house, I'd rather be independent. But then, that'd give me less time to prepare.

How can I stop feeling this rush?? It's driving me nuts.",1682068667.0
21,I feel like I’m trying to crawl up a vertical wall and I keep falling and breaking every bone on the way down,"I got fired from my job of 5 years over petty office politics. 

I found out the man I’d been falling in love with for half a year had a 3-year-long relationship, I was the side chick, and he threatened to “put me in the hospital today” if I tried to warn her. 

Every time I try to talk to a new guy, they either have a girlfriend already, or get sexual way too quickly. A couple of them have fucking wives. 

I am entirely dependent on alcohol. I drink, and then isolate, because I’m sad and embarrassed. I think I’m going into a semi-voluntary detox facility on Monday, but I’m terrified and embarrassed and sad. 

I don’t think I am in unal*ving territory, but I am so sad and apathetic and lonely and I feel so small and so scared all the time. 

I just want to drink myself to sleep, and I wouldn’t mind the sleep being permanent. 

I feel like I can’t find a way out. Every time I try to crawl out of the hole, I fall back further and harder. 

Any advice would help. I don’t want this for myself, but it seems too astronomical to fix. I’m looking for a savior that isn’t coming. I know I need to save myself. But I don’t know that I can and I’m so scared.",1682037881.0
22,I sleep on my moms couch and I have heart failure.,"Hi everyone. While I’m lying here leaving a hole in this couch, and feel like I’ve wasted the last few years of my life- I wanted to talk about my life a little bit - maybe someone will give a listening ear, be willing to help… 
i was diagnosed with heart failure last year. Ever since I’ve been struggling extremely to find work, get any financial help. 
I have a shitty car, constantly has issues it’s 19 years old. I’m in college currently, awaiting financial aid to come through in may. I am struggling severely to save any money since I have to purchase my own groceries and gas - so I have $2 to my name as of right now. I’m mainly asking for advice, if you were in my situation and all you had a was a shit car and a couch to sleep on - how would you plan or create a way to have your own things, a house and a new car would be wonderful.. truly a blessing so… trying to see how others if in my shoes - what would you do? 
Btw - my parents are both alcoholics, and divorced. I had a rocky few years after 17 I’m 21 now and back at my moms and didn’t have a room to myself so I sleep on living room couch and keep my bags where they keep the towels in the closet. I don’t feel at home anymore in a place that used to be home.. and I’m scared for my health consistently - I don’t eat daily as one should, I’m malnourished, and I know I need to take care of my heart.",1681995859.0
23,I'm having a difficult time moving on.,"I (30 mtf) fell in love with my best friend (27 mtf). She ended up ghosting me and blocking me on everything without telling me why and I can't get over it. It has plummeted me into this depression. Now we're about to move out of Florida to separate states and I know we'll never see or speak to each other again. I've tried to reach out so many (too many) times. I've wrote her a 7 page letter. And the most recent attempt has been a last ditch effort to speak to her one last time to get closure so I may move on. Our mutual friend tried helping me reach out but she still refused. 

I'm writing this because I'm starting to destroy my own life. I'm hurting my loved ones and I'm starting to consider hurting myself. I've told those that know my position I'm not able to hurt myself and while that was true, I fear it's not anymore. It's been a constant thought and my ex-best friend is the root cause of it. 

How am I suppose to move on? How do I bear this pain without doing something drastic? I'm in therapy already and she knows everything for the most part. My therapist recommended anti-depressants but I don't like the idea. I honestly believe if I were able to just talk with my ex friend I could move on. 

If you got this far, thank you for reading.

Excerpt:

Today I have been thinking a lot, last week I felt like a two or three on a scale of 10 feeling very low, thinking about the past and the trauma. My mind goes back to that moment where the person that I trusted the most hurt me physically. Think about my mother and my brother, verbal abuse that I have to overcome for my whole life. I’m only 34, it’s supposed to be just halfway into life. I have a lot of days where I feel confident, optimistic, safe, working and earning. But just like all of you on this subreddit, I have had ideations and attempts to leave this world. I feel like I should have died 10 times in the last five years. I think a lot about what led me to being diagnosed with bipolar type one. I do pity myself, I feel sad that a good girl will never wish anyone harm, finds this world too cruel for her existence and her friends struggle the same.

When we were children and younger, we didn’t know much about the evil side of this world. I was a happy kid and Disneyland is still my favorite place on Earth. I was just 15 when I lost my father to suicide. I know now for a fact, that humans are coded, and need a mother and a father to parent them forever. Any human who creates other humans should have responsibility, and the emotional strength to raise somebody to have a better life than they did. To have an easier life, to protect your baby from evil people. When you lose that figure at a young age, and you are left with a disabled mom and a schizophrenic brother, you see the world in a whole different way.

People who had violent family members that had bad addictions and horrible behavior, will never be the same. I often wonder why humans have the capability to abuse one another and incite violence. I became an atheist, because it’s clear to me now that God is not all powerful or all knowing or taking care of me as a protector.. My entire life god was to be feared and followed by every rule. Being half Muslim, I had to deal with so much drama from Sharia law. Being half Christian, I witnessed all of them with fake churches, hateful people that want to incite war,  eastern Europe is a very different place.",1681992922.0
25,how to move forward?,"so, I am a 20 year old girl who took a break from classes this semester, and I feel very lost and as if I have no direction in my life right now. I recently got out of a relationship of 4-5 years because I was being groomed, and that was really hard for me. I started basically giving up on school work last year, so I decided to take a break this semester to get my life together. I still work and have a job, and i’m taking classes this summer so I don’t have to worry about not going back again. but my mental health has been really terrible, and it keeps deteriorating. i have ocd and adhd along with depression, so it makes it harder for me to function. even on my days off, i don’t do anything i enjoy bc i don’t pay attention or care enough.  i just sleep all day, or i’m on my phone, and i really hate it. i’m super unhappy and lost. can anybody give me advice on how to enjoy life again?",1682039639.0

I say all this to say that I know life is rough, I know life can chew you up and spit you out and do it all over again. I know we at times feel so alone and so unworthy of love, we ask ourselves why would anyone waste even a second on us, right? You’re probably saying “why is this complete stranger even writing this?” 

It’s because I understand, I still have my moments and that is so fucking okay to just have your moment. It takes more courage and strength to wake up with trauma following behind you, you force a fake smile, hide and drop real tears all to face a world that doesn’t understand.

33,Sidelined with no advocate,"First you should know I am older, a grandmother, divorced, retired, and wondering how my life came to this. My life has not as hard as it has for most, but it was filled with rejection and loneliness. Nothing except my children has had any lasting value. Without them, I can't imagine where I would be. That being said, both of them and I have had struggles to cope with my sense of insecurity and their needs to be secure and content in their adult lives.

Their father decided before my 50th birthday that he was too miserable to stay. Though it hurt beyond anything I could have imagined, I took the opportunity to acquire my graduate degree, start a new more financially and emotionally rewarding career. From the outside I appeared confident, capable and well. I didn't want the children, my extended family and the few remaining friends to see me as a victim. They didn't then. I reached a modecum of success. No, I didn't set the world on fire, but I did sustain myself until retirement. In fact, after my youngest went off to university, I moved to another large metro area where pay and opportunity was greater. I did return after over seven years to work out the remaining years to retire and be close to the children, their spouses and grandchildren. So, it looks OK, doesn't it?

It's not. I have been mostly a loner for my entire life. To say this was by choice wouldn't be true. My parents moved the family many times when I was growing up to support my father's climb up a corporate ladder to upper management. He never went higher in spite of his efforts and the many moves. Long-term connections for an insecure child with deep feelings of inadequacy were impossible. My parents were not socially adapt. There were no role models on how to engage people and nurture friendships. We simply got by day to day. So, now in the last quarter of life, I have few friends, many superficial acquaintances and two adult children who don't know how integrate me into the lives they carved for themselves.

Don't get me wrong. I have no desire to live with them or see them all the time. They are busy older millennials with careers, homes, children and pets. I don't fit in even on the edges. My daughter-in-law, tolerates me in a passive aggressive manner. She never makes eye contact. Never initiates conversation and prefers the step-mother and her own mother to care for the children. That she has made abundantly clear. My son doesn't dare speak on my behalf. Therefore my time with the grandchildren is guarded and limited. I told my son that it hurts me deeply. I never say he or she hurt me, only that I hurt at the rejection. He cannot look me in the eye. He must keep peace at home. So I keep my distance so as not to create more angst. I stay at home, aching to hold the grands knowing that my ex's wife and my son's mother-in-law are embedded with grands. Why? Both of them are 16 years younger than me. Yes, my ex did the natural thing and married a younger woman. What's new?

Both women are great people. I have nothing against either. Though they are both have very different backgrounds from me . It would be helpful if my son and DIL would inform me on why I am unworthy. I don't drink, smoke or hang with undesirable people. I wouldn't harm a flea. I bring a lot to the table in interests, musical appreciation, foreign language skills, a love of outdoors and playing with the kids. Yet, I stand outside looking in. My grandkids are affectionate with me and we tell and express love with one another. They both seem confused though. I can't say or do anything that would affirm to the babes that I am hurt. They must see Nana as strong, kind and loving even if I am dying inside. They are too young to process these crazy adult dynamics.

My daughter is aware of my hurt and the situation, but she stays out it as she should. She and her brother have a good relationship. She doesn't want tension over me getting in the way. Besides my therapist, she and one dear friend are the only people who know how distraught I get over this.

Would it be appropriate if I requested a time with my son and his wife and ask for honesty? I have never had the opportunity to plead my case. I don't have a clue why this is except my DIL has never shown me an ounce of attention or inquired about me in anyway since they started dating 14 years ago.. Something has to be wrong. I need to know what if anything I can do to bridge this awful divide. Without my grandchildren what am I?

Why am I like this. I fall for the ones that don't want to commit and don't like the ones who like me. All of my  friends are far away since I came back to the province ever since covid.

36,Using Mindfulness Meditation to Overcome Anxiety and Depression 🧘‍♂️🌟,"1️⃣ Choose a technique: Try breath-focused or body scan meditation to find what works best for you.

2️⃣ Set aside daily time: Dedicate a few minutes each day to practice in a quiet, distraction-free space. Gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable. ⏰

3️⃣ Begin the meditation: Relax, close your eyes, and focus on your breath or body. Gently bring your attention back to the present moment if your mind wanders. 🌬️

4️⃣ Cultivate non-judgmental awareness: Observe your thoughts and emotions without labeling them as good or bad. Acknowledge their presence and let them pass without getting caught up in them. 🍃

5️⃣ Apply mindfulness to daily life: Practice mindfulness in everyday activities like eating, walking, or having a conversation to improve mental health. 🚶‍♀️🍽️

It took a lot out of me to work and having to look after her as she couldn't walk for a while. Of course I'd do it again in a heartbeat but it was difficult.

I miss having more friends and I wish i didn't feel like I have to do forced interactions.
I want to pay off some debts I have and then save and try and think of a way to change my life pattern.

43,Depressed and Sick of Life,"I grew up in a family of narcissists and felt invisible. They only noticed me when they had some problem they expected me to fix for them, I would hear one sob story after the other but I can count on the fingers of one hand the times they were bothered about my problems (once out of guilt). I got so low I took pills and ended up in hospital. Even then, all they could think about was themselves. People have told me I'm very independent, but I had no choice. The alternative was being verbally abused and made to feel I was a burden, so I just stopped asking for help Sometimes I don't want to be so independent, it would be nice to feel cared about for a change when I have a problem.

The thing is that this has happened with other people in my life. I like to be kind and helpful, but don't want to be taken advantage of. I would love to be a priority now and again. Peope I know are so fake, they pretend to care and the one or two peope who do care get taken away from me. Then I look at the people around me and they all have someone who genuinely cares about them. So I think it must be me. I'm sick of being alone and hating my life because everyone abandons me or just don't care. How do I stop people thinking they can use me and how do I carry on? The last time I remember being truly happy was when I was a child. It's been over 30 years of being kicked in the teeth at every turn and my hope for anything positive is just about gone. I don't think it will ever happen for me in this lifetime.

46,im so tired,"tw | a bit of everything.



I can't fucking do this anymore. 

My(f21) closest friend(m26) manipulated me into breaking up with my boyfriend and thought he was entitled to me. He shared ALL my information and all our DMs to our friend group. He took pictures of me when i didnt notice and sent it to them. He told them he'd try to get me drunk, or how hed always potray me as this stupid helpless girl who relied on him. He said I was lazy, was the grossest person he knew, and was failing everything - and he was the only one who could ""save"" me. He was always so touchy, and so obsessive with me. He found some of my nsfw pics and told everyone. he saved them - god knows what hes done with them. Theres a ton more, but i'll spare the several paragraphs i could write.

(Thing is, he did something similar 6ish months ago and I blocked him. I was then genuinely considering attempting and drunkenly messaged him for help as he was my closest friend. I was foolish. He did it again, but way worse).

he had a breakdown when I called him out on his actions and he checked himself into a hospital. now all of his friends have been giving me shit. Thing is, they know nothing. I have all the evidence, but oh well. 

My stalker/assaulter(m24) wont leave me alone. Even after constant harassment messages, death threats, emotional abuse, etc. he still tries. Apparently hes going to an event im going to this saturday. I am absolutely terrified but luckily i have friends wholl be there with me. But the fear of him hurting me is still there.

I cant bother with school. I just cant right now. Especially with my parents nagging on about getting all As. Last semester was absolutely horrible. I was failing some classes and just couldn't. I told my parents my struggles and i really needed help but they just yelled and degraded me. I'm failing again (no shit, i told them i couldnt). I dont mind getting a job, i just cant deal with stuff right now. I just need a fucking break.

I stopped taking my meds and recently restarted it. I got referred to a trauma group (bc of stalker) and therapy which Im starting soon. My ED has been relapsing badly, and now adding drinking to the mix. I cant sleep without dreaming of my stalker/assaulter. SH has been extremely bad. I am so tired.

I guess I just needed to get the things from this past week off my chest. Ive been on the edge of attempting. If I die, so be it. If I dont, will I get the break i need right now? Will they finally listen to me? Do i break a bone or something? I just want someone to understand and help. Im so tired",1681936308.0

4 years ago I went to a psychiatrist. I have been going to psychotherapy for many years, but my condition has always caused me anxiety. At first they told me that I had cyclothymia, then mixed personality disorder, then borderline personality disorder ... Then the mood swings stopped and I just felt bad. So I was diagnosed with depression, then resistant depression. I changed many doctors until I found one who would speak to me as an equal.

And this internal struggle exhausted me. But I couldn't just lie down and lie down. I am alone, there is no one to take care of me. And I worked 1-2-3 jobs at once. I wrote my dissertation. I cried and choked with tears, but again and again I trudged to do business.

4 years have passed and yesterday I was covered again. In the morning I got up after a few hours of sleep and went to the academy to sit for another hour and wait for a latecomer. Then I went to work in the office. And I left last at 8 pm. I took a taxi home because I just couldn't stand it. And at home, I just wanted to scream. The cat went past the tray because I didn’t clean it, but I don’t have the strength. I still have freelance orders, I need to work. And you need to conduct scientific research in order to present the topic of the research work in two days.

Hah, this doesn't really fit with the fact that I have ""depression"", right? After all, in depression, every fucking movement requires tremendous effort. Yeees.

But no one cares about me. And I can't take care of myself.

I work hard because I'm in huge debt because of this fucking w@r because I supported the family for a significant amount of time. My cat is sick and I paid for 6 blood transfusions and expensive medicines, she is better, and she lives a full cat life, but all this costs money. I pay for psychotherapy for my sister, because let her start at 14 and become a more whole and mature person earlier than many ... And I need to save money for her future so that at 18 she can leave her mother's house and she will not be blackmailed with money.

49,I want to die but I don't.,"I feel like death is the only thing that could bring me relief from my constant pain but I know that if I commit suicide pain awaits me on the other side.

Depression and anxiety will keep eating me alive until the day I day, why should I make that pain any larger looking for an unlikely joy?

&#x200B;

My parents got divorced when I was young, after that my mom abused me a lot psychologically and I was extremely poor but still found a way to get fat. For like a year and a half I had to wash dishes on my bathtub bc my sink pipes got eaten by rats. After some painful years my mom got married again and I thought that things were finally going to take a good turn but no, my stepdad only sees problems about me and he and my mom are always arguing and I always see my mom suffering bc of it. I've always been bullied and to add to that I've abused benzos. I commit too many mistakes everyday, nobody loves me or really cares about me, and if they do they don't show it.

51,"This morning I told my spouse that I’m struggling more than ever, and the only thing that brings me joy is our son. He didn’t say anything.","I don’t know where to begin to make this make sense and honestly I feel guilty even posting it. I feel ashamed and like I’m being manipulative or selfish by speaking up, especially given his reaction. 

My post history should explain a little bit of context. He has cheated on me twice that I know of. The most recent was December 2022 and I haven’t been right since. He has *not* followed through on couples therapy or being more aware of the household needs. 

Other things to note, I struggle with chronic illness. Hashimoto’s/Hypothyroidism, C-PTSD, ADHD, depression, anxiety, etc etc. I am drowning and I take no joy in anything anymore, except for raising my son. I’ve always loved children, but there’s something so special about having my own. I feel that I’m healing part of myself that was never nurtured by raising him. 

So, I told him this morning. He’s seen me break down multiple times over the course of the past several months as well as disassociation spells. It seems like I have to explain everything to him—he never educated himself on what’s going on with me and just waits for me to fill him in on the need to knows. I come home from my job crying every day and I apply to new jobs every day. I told him that I can’t keep doing all of this; managing the house, keeping up with my health and my son’s, my very demanding job, and trying to heal mentally. 

He has a very comfy hybrid job that only requires about 4hrs of actual work most days. He’s never looked for new jobs, or resumed higher education to get a degree. He just….doesn’t want to. 

I think he might resent me for being sick and for needing time to recover. I kind of resent him for being blind to the fact that because of his choice to have an affair I have spiraled into a dark place. And I don’t know, I think if my spouse was coming to me with the same issues and I had a clean bill of health, I’d be doing everything to take some of the burden off of them.

 aspergers)  and i do so well in school despite my disability, but over the past few years I've been getting less and less happy around people, yet crave the feeling to be loved but i know I'm not worth loving, I'm a fat ugly retarded selfish bitter smelly disgusting creepy quiet anti-social piece of human filth who keeps enabling his own self-destructive behaviors.",1681920540.0
53,I wish I didn't care.,"**I got really drunk, as per my previous post. I e-mailed one of my former colleagues, who I have a crush on.**

I told her I was drunk. I told her I was fired for one of the KPIs not being met. I said that I missed her, and that I wanted to meet and talk to her. 

I said that I wanted to on the last day we saw each other. That was way back in December, but because we mostly work from home, I didn't see her again. I said ""I can't apologise enough, for getting fired in the first place, and for being drunk.""

Eight hours later, I sent another e-mail, basically making light of the situation. Saying I got home safe, I didn't have any more alcohol that day. I said I'm not the first person this has happened to, but I was really embarrassed. 

""I hope you're OK, reading that. I meant it, I was just overflowing a bit. Thanks for understanding.""

She hasn't called me, which is fine, that makes sense. She hasn't replied to my e-mail either yet, though. So that's what's driving me crazy, I don't know how she's feeling about it. I mean I don't even know, maybe she's on leave and didn't see it.

I hope she's not freaked out though. 

This is what happens. No crush has ever ended up as a relationship. I've never been on a date. I fucking hate having crushes. The first one ended in a horrifying disaster. The others have just been sources of embarrassment, or a way to appear weird and gross.

54,Some helpful tips for managing depression & anxiety ❤️,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all doing well! I wanted to share some valuable tips I've learnt from Speakhealth for managing anxiety and depression:

1. Practice deep breathing exercises for relaxation: Set aside a few minutes each day to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of calm.
2. Keep a gratitude journal to focus on positive aspects of your life: Every day, write down three things you're grateful for. This can shift your focus from negative thoughts to positive experiences, helping to improve your overall mood.
3. Reach out to friends or support groups to discuss your feelings: Opening up about your emotions can help relieve the burden of anxiety and depression. Don't be afraid to share your experiences and seek support from those around you.
4. Engage in regular physical activity to release endorphins: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Physical activity releases endorphins, which can help improve your mood and alleviate feelings of anxiety and depression.
5. Set realistic goals and break them down into smaller, manageable steps: Instead of focusing on large, daunting tasks, break them down into smaller, achievable goals. This can help reduce feelings of overwhelm and increase your sense of accomplishment.

Remember, we're all in this together!",1681902173.0

One of my favorite people in this world have passed due to this and now another person that means the world to me has been diagnosed with cancer and very advanced. I just feel as if cancer just keeps appearing on everyone in my family and then they die. I know it is selfish because I am not the one that's dying but I can't deal with so much pain and loss. It Is horrifying to see them in pain and not being able to do anything. Then, it is more horrifying to see them die after battling so strongly. I just don't understand why it keeps happening and why does it hurt so much afterwards even if Its a process I've gone through already. Death just follows my family and I feel like as soon as someone passes away, the next one comes in with cancer and continues the cicle. All I want is my family complete and healthy again. I am spiring again, lashing out to those close to me and although I try and be aware of my feelings I just can't stand how unfair life is sometimes. This doesn't negate that I know I am blessed to be healthy so far and am surrounded by others whom love me very much but its the people in my family close to me that are passing away and it kind of makes me wish others that im not a close to could get it instead of them which makes me feel even worse.

I still hear your scratchy voice while you sing. Although it never sounded good, it's one of my favorite sounds. 
I miss your storytimes you told me befire going to sleep. I miss learning the Russian alphabet with you. I miss our trips to the airport to see the planes fly away. I miss hugging you. I miss every second we watched movies together. I miss you. Oh god Papa, I miss you so so much. 

I have so many things to tell you, so many stories to tell, happy and sad. 

Papa, I wouldn't be who I am today without you. You taught me to respect others and to cherish the little moments, you taught me thousands of songs and showed me tons of movies. Thank you. Thank you so much.

I'm really, really burnt out. All of the time. I can't find anything that helps except from taking week-long 'breaks' where I don't talk to anyone and am mainly in the dark, in my room, with my headphones and a weighted blanket. Of course, I can't do that, because I have to work and go to school. But the means that I fall back into depressive episodes.

Recently, the school bullying got worse. I get called names, laughed at, mocked. My small comfort plush that I bring everywhere was put in the toilet and he's ruined. The school, who pride themselves on 'inclusivity, diversity and support', don't seem to care. I've had my uniform and comfort clothes ruined too, yet nobody will actually listen to me.

I hate my parents too. I'm supposed to come to them with my problems, to get the support I so desperately need, yet my mother's 'instant bullying solution' is just to 'ignore them'. She didn't say that to my older sister, who was physically bullied, so why does she say it to a child that is on the verge of committing su\*c\*de? I feel like she chooses to ignore my autism just to be more 'convenient'. don't even get me started on my dad. He's a flat earther that thinks vaccines are the root of all evil and that my autism can be 'cured' by eating 'healthier', even though I almost died the last time he tried to get me to eat 'healthier'.

I just can't do this anymore. I'm going to break down and stab someone. I swear, if I go into school tomorrow and somebody laughs at me again I'll punch their fucking face in.

I only eat rice because is the cheapest food I can find.

I have an infection or some shit in both ears (can't fix because no money).

I have athlete's feet (can't fix because no money).

I never laugh or smile because I have a missing tooth since childhood (got bullied everyday at school for that).

I only wear the cheapest sweatpants and hoodies I can buy, I never had jeans, coats, jackets or all that cool stuff.

At times I feel emotions strongly, but I do not feel in myself, I feel it but I know it is just a matter of time before that feeling flees me and I resent even spending time out.
I don’t know what my issue is anymore, it’s been a hard life but I am trying to train myself to get up and try and be happy everyday.
I really wish for better feelings.
My mother in law warned me though, no one would ever want to be near someone who is miserable, but I joked with her saying misery loves company, why can’t I have any.
She didn’t like it but, I am fine with it.
I guess it could be summed up to that no matter who I’ve told what’s happened to me, all they could do was just listen, then find some way it was my fault or what I should have done differently..
Honestly I try not to dwell, and not to tell anyone about it anymore because all they do is treat me as a lesser person after I say to them my trauma.

68,Post-breakup depression?,"Hiya all. I'm a 31yo guy, been dealing with depression since I was 16.

&#x200B;

In my first years I dealt with a bad psychologist that worsened my situation, I gradually began to close myself more and more in my house, depression manifested as physical symptoms and rejection of everything and everyone. Hatred became my weapon, and I sometimes lashed to my closed ones too.

Since I was 18 I have been on meds, and since my coming out when I was 24 I started feeling gradually better. Not a recluse anymore, I slowly started seeing some boys, then found a group of friends, then a job. Three years ago I met a guy that became my boyfriend, and felt the need to ""shed"" the psych help because I was feeling much better. With a guy to rely on, I felt no longer alone.

All this changed last September when, after some rough months where I broke my right hand and started feeling anxious and a burden to my bf, he left me and I had to return to my parents' home with our dog (he left him to me because he felt i could give him ""more love and care""). I began our breakup with sadness, then anger, then closed again like all these years doing therapy meant nothing. I feel like I went back when I was 24, when nothing mattered but I had some shreds of a social life.

I stand here now, after seven months, again empty and alone. I went back to the psychiatrist and got back on meds again, but I feel it will be a long journey.

I ask you all, how did you / would you deal with rebound depression after a breakup?

Added bonus question: I am trying to meet some new people, and last month I met another guy that has been dealing with depression that lives a bit far away.

I enjoy being alone most of the time, I don't like to interact with people at all unless it's necessary, and that's just how it is. I was in the Marines for 4 years, got out honorably last august, family was proud of me and everything, but I think I took the freedom aspect of getting out way too seriously, I didn't get a job, bought an apartment and I'm just living in it, it's been so long since I've gone and done anything social, I've cut all ties with my military friends, but I miss them.. I'm just ashamed that they'll see what I've become: an overweight, depressed loser who's too scared to do anything with his life because he's afraid to walk out the front door.. the complacency has set in and there's really nothing I can do to help it, I'm so afraid of how others will perceive me that I just don't go out at all, I think it's because after being in here not getting any exercise or daily sunlight has spiraled me into a severe depression/anxiety, (I haven't gone to a psychiatrist or a therapist for the same reasons). I hate what I've become and I'm too fucking scared to do shit about it.. . I have family that I've just flat out told horrible things to so they would stop seeing me, contemplated ending it but I'm also a coward so, there's that. I just want to be myself again..

So I have my final exam next week. It's my last year before graduating. I almost never went to classes because I feel it was a lost of time and I didn't have the courage to feel lonely when surrounded by people that are friends. 
I didn't go to classes also because it puts me under a lot of stress. I have a ""friend"" but each time I'm with her, I feel so disappointed in myself, because she succeed. She has social anxiety but she get over it. She succed to follow lectures, whereas I couldn't focus on it. 
Also, she is someone that is not patient. If something doesn't go in her way, she get angry easily, and sometimes she scream on people. I am more understanding, so it's me that tell her to calme down and try to explain the situation on both side. She is dyspraxic, she can't to delicate experiment, so I have to do it. However my hands shake due to medical condition. I am more precise than her but still not great. Each time I spill something, she gets angry toward me, saying that I'm useless and that I can't do something right. Then she won't let me practise. 
Each time she succeed in something, she says that it's easy and people that didn't succeed was because they didn't put any effort. She can't understand that people can have difficulties in their personal life.
I know she judges me because I struggle with anxiety and depression, because hey ! She gets over it so it's easy !

Also when I tell my concern to my parents, they don't understand. I always was an excellent student. I know that the decrease in my grades are not due to ""capacity"" but motivation and I feel bad about it.
My parents say that I was worried for nothing because I always succed, and can't understand that this time, it's not the same. I didn't learn anything for the exam. They say that I'm working too much, and I just have to relax, but I know this isn't the reality.
I'm afraid about what they will think when I will got my results.
I also have the impress to betray myself. The only thing where I succeeded was in school. I work so much to reach my goals. But now I destroy all of my precedent works because I feel depressed. A part of me wants to accuse the depression, but another part says that it's just me who make no effort. I don't know which one is right, because no one listen to my concerns. For all, I already pass the exams.

73,I no longer know how to be happy,"I am a 28yo male. I had a relatively stable and happy upbringing, no major traumas or anything, but throughout my life I have always struggled with a lot of anxieties, loneliness and depression. I never had many friends, usually not more than 3 friends at any given time in my life. The way I managed to survive until now is that I tend to be extremely emotionally reliant on a single person (a peer). As of now, 3-4 different friends have come to occupy that role during different periods of my life, but each time it would end in me totally making my happiness and self-worth dependent on that person. Their hobbies would become mine, I would be happy when they are around, and when things break down I would plunge into depression. There would be nothing properly ""mine"" in my interests, lifestyles, routines, and memories to hold onto. I would feel that there's no point in continuing to live, as my life has lost all meaning outside of that one deep connection that got me going.

For the past eight years I've become emotionally dependent on this one girl I knew from long ago. I saw her as my soulmate, although at some point I started having feelings for her as well. Like every time, everything about her came to define my interests, daily routines etc, and so when in the last two months we interacted with each other less often than usual, my life completely disintegrated. I tried striking up conversations with my two other friends who I still maintain contact, but they were simply dry, factual conversations of the yes/no answer sort because I no longer remember how to talk to other people casually and gain happiness from it. No one would text me unless I texted them first. I couldn't eat, work, or get out of my apartment to do anything because everything I did up was related to her in some way. Both my wellbeing counsellor at uni and my soulmate herself suggested several groups and events I could attend to meet new people, but the truth is I got zero happiness from attending. Being there with all these strangers only made me feel worse, as there was no one I could get the same emotional connection I got from that girl.  I also tried exploring new interests on my own and went online shopping a lot, but all these attempts were ineffective.

I feel like I'm stuck with a future where there's no conceivable chance of meeting a soulmate who I can find happiness with again. I feel so lonely, and even though I've wanted to take my life for years now never once did I have the courage to do it. This marks me as ""low risk"" in the eyes of my therapists, but to me it feels like I'm condemned to be tortured with no end in sight. Every professional I talked to tried to suggest me various events to meet new people, but all those socializing only made me aware of what I am missing the most.

I don't even know what's the point of me typing this on a forum where no one ever really knows anyone. But I just don't see the point of trying to fight this lifelong loneliness anymore.

Additionally, even if I were in a less academically rigorous setting, my aspirations require me to have a high GPA. 
I have suffered and coped with anxiety and depression for almost half of my life. A year ago, my depression spiked significantly. Previously, I’d been recovering quite smoothly. I had been engaged with my interests, performing well in school, and consistently leaving my comfort zone. Over this period, I had been trying a range of medications, concluding with using Zoloft for several months. The side effects worsened, and I quit. 

Then, roughly a month after, my anxiety began to wane. My misophonia and hypersomnia quickly decreased and then burned away. I became less responsible and grew reckless. When someone says something hurtful, before I could respond with ease. Now I can barely get a cohesive sentence out. It’s as if I’m an onlooker on a girl spiralling.

It really sucks, especially since it makes me feel like a jerk. When I'm just reading something positive and I start getting mad and upset, I feel like a bad person. Then i cry and i just want to go to sleep for the rest of the day. Then I start avoiding whatever it was that made me feel that way.
Is there a way I can handle this? Any techniques? Thank you",1681760843.0

84,How do I recover from being a depressed shut-in?,"I’m currently 26 years old but I’ll be 27 in September. For the past 4 years after my Dad died and the lockdown I have been severely depressed. Since the age of 22 I’ve barely left the house, I have no friends, no girlfriend. I have never even had sex, but I’m not an incel or a woman hater, I love women, I just never leave my home and have extreme social anxiety.

I’m afraid to reach out to my former friends. I am worried they will have matured so much and I have devolved so far that I’m ashamed of them seeing me.

I’ve worked 3 jobs in the past 4 years for only 6 months at a time each. I have no savings. I have made no personal progress over the past 4 years. I’ve gained 84 pounds over this time. I’m currently 250 pounds at 6 foot 1. I feel disgusting and ugly and I feel like I’m being watched and stared at by everyone when I leave my home. I constantly feel anxious and paranoid. I’ve developed OCD. I constantly feel guilty about where I am in life and not having a job, but I genuinely cannot face working at the moment. I am college educated and have two qualifications.

I feel so fucking depressed about the amount of time I’ve wasted in my life and that the best part of my 20’s are gone. I’m starting to feel suicidal. I’ve started trying to work on myself as I’ve lost a decent amount of weight (274 down to 250) but I’ve still got so far to go. How to I dig myself out of this hole? I feel completely detached from reality and like nothing is real, like i’m in a coma I just want to wake up from. How can I recover when I’m so far behind in life. I’m currently at an all-time low mood wise.

I feel like everyone I meet is superior to me. I can’t shake this feeling that I’m completely defective as a human being. I’m finding it harder to relate to people the more time goes on. I feel like I’m barely human. If I ever do recover, how can I explain to people the fact that I spent over 4 years of my life doing absolutely NOTHING. No socialisation, no work, no personal development. I feel like people will see me as a strange, boring non-person.

Any advice would be helpful and I’m 100% committed to putting it into practice.

Thank you.",1681679601.0

I don't know what to do. I am 19/M and do an apprenticeship as a programmer,  but all I do at work is procrastinate. 

I constanty think about how much I hate my family and how my family actively tries to ruin the live of every family member.

I constanty think about my mother who very often threated that she would kill herself because of me and one time actually tried it. My sister told me that I found her after she tried it, but I can't remember it.

I also constanty have to think about all the times my mother told me that I would end homeless and without a job living under a bridge. And the times she hit me and pressed me with her overweight in a corner and just hit me, or when she just ran through the door of my room while it was locked, or through the bathroom door, or through the kitchen door.

I hate that my father always prefered me over my sister. I mean shouldn't that be good for me? But no I hate it, because I can't stand it when my sister doesn't feel good, because she is the most important person in my life.

I hate that I regularly hit my head against the wall and bite my left arm.

I hate that I constanty feel like I only want to cry, but can't cry, because when I cried when I was younger my mother would just say ""stop crying or i'll give you something to cry about""

I hate that I am ugly as fuck and can't talk to woman so I will never find a girlfriend and experience love.

I hate that I still have to live in my mothers houwey because I can't afford an apartment.

I hate the first boyfriend of my mother who regularly hit me and my sister.

I hate the second boyfriend of my mother who stole our money that we don't really have much of.

And I hate that I can't just kill myself, because I promiemsed it to my sister, that I woukd never do this (she promised the same to me) because both of us don't want to leave the other back with this bullshit.

88,Sad,"I feel quite disconnected from life in general and from human beings in particular. Certainly, I've tried to see life from other perspectives. I've gone to a psychologist, and I've also been to a psychiatrist, but I haven't gotten any results. Honestly, I'm getting tired of trying to find solutions that don't really exist. 

Often, we're told that the problem is the circumstances of life, but perhaps the problem is life itself. Personally, I feel like I shouldn't have been born. I would have been much more useful and happy if I had been a bird, a worm, or something similar. Unfortunately, I happened to be a human being, and unfortunately, I'm still alive. 

But really, I feel very disconnected from human beings in particular. I don't feel capable of making friends, and I don't identify with any system of values that's preached nowadays, whether it's religion or some ideological cause. I'm not interested in politics, religion, the future of humanity, and I don't have anything in particular that grabs my attention.

96,What do I do.,"I feel as though I've been dealing with depression a long time. Likely from childhood given how I used aggression to keep people away from me. Yeah, I was picked on back in the day too. An while they're forgot, I remember all those things like they happened yesterday. I can't hold them accountable for those things anymore as an adult, but I can't say between in it and general life it didn't contribute anything. I spent some time after that just floating around, didn't have shit and in a lot of ways, I still don't. 

 People my age are getting married, having kids (wether accidentally or on purpose) and I'm here with nothing. Hell I'm going bald before 30 and there's nothing I wanna do that'll make it better. Instead of having kids or getting married, I took up smoking weed to see if it would help curve my (father's) inherited mentality. It does, alot before anyone asks but I've never been high enough to not remember the days. I feel like it's self medicating because I know why I do it better than anyone. I still remember my mom telling me ""I like you better this way"" in reference to a day when I was really stoned. 

Two years ago I met a friend online, who I'll call J for the remainder of her mentions. Now J has easily been one of the best friends I could ask for, and in many ways has been my only friend. She started going through this very bad time in her life maybe a year(?) into us being friends. As a result she would come to me for advice about what she should do or vent when she was stressed out. Which, is, was and will always be fine, I've always been that person. She is everything you could ask for as a friend and even as a general companion (were not dating or anything like that she's just very dear to my heart). 

Eventually we connected with someone she barely knew through another online person she knew,  we settled into a routine of playing nightly together as a result. Becoming better friends then I feel like I deserve in life. Eventually, X (as I'll call him) had some major life changes occur and disappeared for about 8 months and if it's one thing J used to never like it was people who just disappeared. She knew something was up but didn't push to hunt him down. 

To cut down on time since I'm already wasting yours I'll cut to the next part. Eventually X came back, which I was mostly indifferent about, I mean, the mans life is his own let him do as he pleases. Now over the course of them reconnecting and talking I've been left behind. She took to calling me a sociopath a few months ago and it hurt me, a lot. I never considered myself to be that kinda person, especially around her. It still tears me up all this time later and there isn't anything I can do about it. I know they have a trip planned where they say they want me to come along but actions always speak louder than words. They don't care if I come, I barely know the plan and no one has been bothered enough to give me any info. Hell they don't even care if I'm there when we play anything anymore.

I get that people shift from person to person if they feel a better safety net when talking to them but why am I the shadow. Why do I have to miserable for others to be happy around me, is that what I deserve? 

To make matters worse, I have no idea if smoking actually helps how I feel or if I'm just so numb that I don't care. When I sober up it all comes back to me like an avalanche and I hate myself more as a result. 

 I suppose that's my plight, I'm a lame, with a mother who likes me better stoned, two friends who don't give a shit that I exist anymore than the bug on the window sill on top of one of whom thinking I'm a sociopath. I feel like I should blame others bug I know the only one at fault is me. If you read this all the way, I'm sorry its whiny and well, depressing.

""I feel extremely alone in this empty existential dimension. I am surrounded by a multitude of individuals whose presence is visible, but whose reality is foreign to mine. I feel a painful sensation that seems to make me sink into a pit full of water, and the weight of the soul is like lead that inexorably drags me down. And I don't see the bottom of it. I am incessantly drawn to and held in its desolate abyss, where human closeness seems a contradiction. A pit populated by my darkest thoughts, which make a lot of noise, which echoes between the walls without a match, without anyone there to save me from that endless grave. And so I keep sinking deeper and deeper, until my breath leaves me completely.""

I've felt lonely my entire life because I could not find someone who feels at least a little bit of affection for me. Sometimes I think about ending my life, because it will never get better, it sucked since I was born, why should things change?

106,"If I can do it, so can you","**How I went from being hospitalized twice and being on suicide watch to being happy and successful in my life, having control of my emotions, not letting my thoughts control me, coaching, consulting and more:**

*YOU SEE IN 2013…..*

• I had a random surgery and afterwards my entire life changed for the worse

• I had multiple freak physical ailments that prevented me from contributing to society that no doctor could figure out

• I was at a new doctor every few days with no answers and quickly fell into a deep dark depression

• I was hospitalized a few months after my surgery, put on suicide watch and I still couldn’t cope or figure out how I would make it to the next day

• I couldn’t sleep, talk, eat or do any of the normal everyday things humans do… I thought my life was truly over

Well, after being hospitalized a second time in 2016, I knew something had to be different, so I focused on just a few VERY simple principles and everything since then has changed:

1.) I learned simple tactics to help calm my anxiety attacks and to prevent overthinking which led be down a rabbit hole

2.) I got educated on medication and different forms of therapy

3.) I got educated on healthy vs harmful relationships between me, myself and I as well as with others in my inner circle

4.) I learned a variety of different lifestyle habits that helped stabilize my mood

Starting in January 2017, I was not having suicidal thoughts, I was able to wake up every day and accomplish things I couldn’t before, not having to worry about not sleeping, eating or functioning at a high level, lost 50 pounds, got a job at my college’s newspaper, coached and educated others on my story among many other things…. and if I can do it, ANYONE CAN!!!

I don’t care if you’re 18 and feel like todays going to be the last day of your life, OR if you’re 70 and haven’t been able to accomplish life goals you might want to still achieve and still can’t get out of the everyday rut where there’s no light at the end of the tunnel….

Stay the course and keep pushing forward. Keep learning – keep your discipline – and keep taking scary amounts of action.

You’re already there – time just hasn’t caught up yet!

Let’s make this the BEST WEEK EVER,

108,Just need some help,"Been going through a lot. My mom almost died of a saddle bloodclot back in August. 2 months later, my girlfriend(for 1 year)'s parents placed a school restraining order between us. We both broke this restraining order, but I was caught due to a report by her friend and chose not to report her in fear of her hating me. Lost a bunch of friends. I was already depressed and suicidal prior to all of this, too. After I got a school referral for breaking the order, I tried apologizing to her parents. It didn't work and I found out that my gf wanted nothing to do with me. Everyday I was tortured by memories of her and quickly became suicidal. Kept it bottled up. I made a plan and everything. Never self harmed, though. Eventually, I got help, but it doesn't just end there. No, that'd be to easy. I continued to torture myself by trying to contact my girlfriend and right whatever wrongs I made. Never worked. Her friend then lied to her and they reported me for somewhat false information. I cried. First time I cried in months by that point. I reported her. I now hate her. Anytime I see her, I'm filled with anger because of how pretentious she is and how much she and her friends ruined my life. I'm already anxiety ridden from that whole situation, now add on a quick visit to a mental hospital(where I was almost killed by my roommate. Everyone else was chill, don't get that twisted) on benchmark week for A WEEK, missing all assignments then having to explain where you were to everyone, including teachers. Only good thing to come out of being gone was emails from teachers letting me know things will get better. Then, only a week after I reported my ex, I was hit with more. My ex's friends began accusing me of sending an email of a picture of the friend and her bf holding hands to one of their mom's that didn't want them dating. I tried to prove my innocence, but they wouldn't listen. More stress. I'm in all Pre-AP and an AP class alongside an early college class as a freshman in High School. More. STRESS. I've reached a point where I'm scared of more confrontation from others that I've begun starting to isolate myself in class and get myself far from people or just not talk at all.

110,Im having a hard time not giving up on life.,First of all I want to say I don’t want to give up. I have a plan to do ECT in 2 weeks which hopefully will help me because nothing else has. But I’m having a really hard time waiting those 2 weeks especially because I got kicked out of my school a week ago because they think I’m to unsafe for myself and don’t want to be responsible if I SH there. so I’m in my room by myself all day now and don’t interact at all I feel awful. How do I keep holding on for those 2 weeks it seems like an eternity. Especially because I’ve been suffering from depression for 11 years so I’m not new to waiting. I just now am isolated and waiting and it’s hard.,1681609282.0

112,off my chest," 

hi, ive been suffering with depresson for years and mostly have sucidal thoughts weekly, ive had a stressful time recently because we had a family member who has cancer, but luckalily after a surgary he is now cancer free and i was happy it was a good day in mylife and it was sunny outside aswell. but the next few days passed and ive gone back into my depressive state.

i have no intrest in things any more but when i do i have big intrest in something then it fades, so many of the things i used to do to make me feel happy have fadeded away.

i have little self respect and little self asteem, im overweight, ugly and a little odd to most people i talk too, i have never had a gf, i still live with my mother and sister and i waste most of my money on food and onlyfans that is part of a vicous cycle of feeling self pity to induldgance to distract my mental heath. and its just not fixing it self, im terrible with money and im bad at work always messing things up. i just feel disapointed in myself i even clequshe as it sounds 'feel lonely in a room full of people'.

this all may sound like a rant but its some of the aspects that has made me feel depressed. i try and avoid the real world by sleep all the time, somedays i eat too much or too less, i feel like everyone is looking at me and i dont like it.

i cry a lot to get myself to sleep, i feel alone in this world and in my heart. not aure if im looking to get help or to rant about my issues but i feel this could above my life is getting darker and stronger. i feel like im loosing the will to live much longer. but this is only some of my story.

if anyone is willing to help please comment.

My entire life was horrible. I lost my parents on my 20’s. My mom took her life and I love her so much I still can’t believe, now I am almost 30. I feel ugly. I am completely alone. I don’t have boyfriend , friends, I am not close to anyone. I only have my dog which I love him deeply and Am grateful for his company. But is not enough. I don’t have money for therapy.

115,When will this feeling end?,"I’ve been dealing with depression throughout my life. Every time I encounter a depressive episode, I freeze and forgot what I have to do so I quit. It’s happened to me 3x in my life so far. 

This time it feels completely different from before. I posted on this subreddit about what happened. I’m feeling so numb and forgot how to do basic normal things. Like cooking, cleaning, socializing with people. One of my fav hobbies is cooking, I cooked so many new recipes last year. This year I hardly cooked at home. It sucks bc when I’m not cooking, I don’t eat (don’t have appetite to eat) so I lose weight very easily. 

I also start SH by picking at my body scabs which makes it harder to heal. Now that summer is near, I’m feeling very insecure to wear short sleeves and shorts because it’ll show my SH scars all over my body. The weather has been sunny lately, I’ve been outside sunbathing for most of the day to darken the scars, hopefully it won’t be as noticeable. 

I’m also on a relationship break after being in it for 6yrs. Every time I think about it I get very teary over it. It’s my first relationship and I love and care for him a lot. Part of the reason why we decided to take a break it’s bc of my most recent depressive episode where I slept / lay in bed for 2 days straight without eating any food, showering or eat any food. I don’t have any appetite when I’m sad so I lose weight quickly. I also stopped socializing, going out with friends due to my depression. He felt that he was emotionally unavailable to support me bc he’s also going through a lot throughout the current tech recession. It feels so shitty that this sick disease can ruin a relationship. I was SO happy in my relationship just a few months ago. We’re still keeping in touch through text. He’s like the only person who texts me everyday besides my family. 

I feel so lost in this world. I lost a sense of myself, my abilities. Everyday I’m existing for my family and friends, but not living life I want. 

Ive been seeing a therapist for 2 months. And I’m on lexapro. I honestly don’t know if therapy or medication are helping at all. I feel the same everyday, lost and unhappy. I don’t have any goals or ambitions in life anymore.

Me, f, and her are working on our relationship because we both have things we need to work on. Quite honestly in my opinion her more than myself just based on why our arguments start. But I'm not here to talk about my relationship. I'm here because I'm sad, I'm depressed, I want to go back to my bad habits but I won't because of my tattoos, if you have them I know you understand what I mean. I don't want to go back but it almost aches when I'm like this... I've tried therapy. Many times for many lengths of time so that isn't an option. Either way people just seem to not want me. And those that did in my past I unfortunately pushed away after *trauma warning* I got raped. I tried to reconnect but it failed for many separate reasons.. I want people so badly but it seems like either they don't want me or life stops me from being able to see them which makes them stop trying. I'm so depressed it isn't funny. I don't know how to have friends anymore and it scares me. I don't want to be alone anymore. My relationship is not roses, like I said we need to work on things. But if we broke up I would literally not have a single person in my life... what should I do? How can I do it? Can you give me some guidance? Please.

118,Do you think exploring your past is key to solving the present day issues?,"The question is pretty simple. Growing up, I was bullied at school, had no friends, didn't talk with many people and had a lot of thoughts of suicide. My parents pushed me to do better and we're strict disciplinarians. I would come home and cry my heart out as my mum didn't hold back against me. It sounds pathetic but I was so hopeless back then. I left school, failing all my classes. I went to community college and it was the same story. No friends, no social interaction. I slowly stopped caring.

119,Help needed for friend,"I (30’s M) have a friend (also 30’s M) who has been struggling with depression in some way or another for a few years now and it seems to be getting worse. 

I’m really trying hard to be a mate for him and do whatever small amount I can to try and help but am having a really hard time managing to. He is quite open about things when speaking or messaging so it’s not that he won’t talk about it but he has more or less stopped socialising with our friendship group and when I try to make plans just the two of us to hang out (generally very safe, quiet, chilled plans) inevitably he cancels last minute as he’s not up to it. My probably overly simplistic view is that hanging out and chatting to a mate would help him but obviously that is often too much for him to consider. 

I don’t really have much experience in these things and so I was wondering if anyone had ideas of things I could do that might help him out? Beyond the obvious ‘just be there for him and keep talking’ I’m a little short on ideas to help him out and getting more and more concerned about him. 

Any help appreciated. Thanks 👍",1681583184.0

123,Sometimes I can't breath without her!,"About 5 years ago I (M27) met my Wife (F47). She approached me through social media once she saw me in gatherings. Her parents were long lost acquaintances of my maternal grand-parents. They had moved to Canada. She asked me out and I was confused for a bit but she looked like the woman I always wanted, She was a Syeda (A person from the descendants of Prophet Mohammad PBUH) She didn't look her age at all she could easy pass for 32 than actually being 42. I didn't even know her age nor I asked for it. She emitted that mommy-vibe I could die for. It had straight effect on my Soul. But after a month she told me she is divorced and have a kid. The other guy abused her and cheated on her. I was so confused what to do. I took some time but I missed her so much so we got back together.

We were so happy together and did everything together. Watching each other all the time on video calls. Eating together, going out still being on video calls even love-making and much more. We watched TV together too. Sometimes people would say we're idiots. I never had so much love in my life. I had fallen head over heels for her and seemed like she was too. But whenever I asked her to (Nikkah) marry me because as Muslims it is necessary. And Haram to be intimate otherwise. She would say yes but on the day she would disappear. Not picking phone not even replying to my texts and than she would reply next day. I fumed with anger but after somedays I would forgive her. She would even say in the name of such Holy Personality forgive me. She knew my weaknesses!

I was confused why does she do that. I thought maybe she isn't sure about me. I offered her a temporary marriage. An option available to legalize it and avoid sin. She agreed and we performed it ourselves as I can recite them. She said we'll make it permanent soon at the end of this year *2019.  We spent great quality time together but it was long distance. I was getting frustrated, As October had reached but she wasn't telling me what she wants. I told her make it good or just leave me. It was pressure tactic as I knew I can't leave her. Finally she said she is coming to Pakistan and I was over the moon. She came but not to me she went somewhere else. She claimed she is at her sisters house. And she'll talk to them about us. Than one day she said her sister isn't agreeing to it and they have taken my Son. They are saying they will give it to her Ex and she'll lose it. Just let me go back and I'll get his custody and come back in a month than no one can break us apart. I was in alot of doubt but I had to agree. For her because I didn't want her to lose her boy because of me.

At my home I had to fight a batte of my own . My parents have been absentee parents my whole life. They were in UAE at that time and they didn't agree to our marriage, they said don't do it. I tried my best to convince them but I had to go to friends at end to help me with my marriage. I did all this for her.  All in vain. She went back to Canada and she kept giving me a new date every month. June had started and I was upto my limit. I was dying for her I told her you're either coming or I am just finishing it all. I have to get my life on track. She promised to come very soon and August was the month she came to me. I was in heaven. I went to pick her up left me bed for her to sleep in and planned everything. By that time my mother was here and they also had agreed for us getting married. We all gave her so much love. Yet there was a problem as she said she couldn't get divorce papers because of Covid she'll send them later from there so we could register our marriage. Still we could have that Islamic Nikkah though.

We both were so good together, people were sometimes jealous watching us. We went up on a long honeymoon at almost 4 locations. After marriage I prayed with her, I washed her feet too 😍. She would shower me with so much love my Life felt complete. It actually felt like we would die for each other. I had bought so much stuff for her I would dress her up and watch her. She was perfect. We also got premium Persian cats as pets! She came for a month but prolonged it to 4 months. We made a century in these days 😉. It was with very heavy heart when the day came she was going back. We both were in tears but I believed that now soon we'll get back together.

After her return our same routine started like all the time on video calls or ip cameras. Taking each other along wherever we go. After a month I asked her for papers and she said still haven't got anything. She would give me a new date every month. And almost a year had passed now I said what the hell are you doing do you want me or not?
She said I want nothing else in the world except you and many other stuff. I didn't know what to do.

One day I received a text on my whatsapp claiming to be a woman interested in me. I told her I'm taken but she tried her best to seduce me. With nudes and stuff. I blocked that number. And same thing happened next day. I blocked about 4 numbers in the next few days. I thought I have put my number somewhere scamming platform. I told my wife about that and she said just talk and ask what do they want and where did they got the contact. I asked them that but rather than answering they would start se*ting right away. I started blocking numbers again. One day I got an idea I thought I would use this to put pressure on my wife for registration. I told her that I'm going to talk to someone as they love me. But I had not received any message. But after some days I got a message on Reddit of same template. I knew something was fishy. Though I started chatting with that person and just gave her enough flirts to keep the chat afloat. I deleted some messages as they could be hurtful to my wife. Than took screenshots and sent to my wife. She was actually encouraging me to talk. Untill one day my Wife said its me. And I cheated on her and so much more. I just chatted with her with some complements. But never even se*ted with that person. She accused me of so much and turned off our contact. I was angry and also dying without her. I begged her to listen to me. I was on my knees for her. She said so much stuff about never going to trust me. But I came up with an idea. I gave her access to all my accounts even whatsapp and bank accounts. For 2 years she had them. She didn't gave me any needed documents nor she visited me. She did visit Pakistan claiming yo visit her sister. I asked why are you treating me like this. My thirst for her is huge. I begged her to come to the house she has with me. She was again making excuses like my sister is like this and that. Now I can't get out of here. They have taken my trolleys and stuff. They are saying we will not let you go there untill you get that marriage registered. So let me just go get the document and I'll return in just somedays. I knew this was a lie but what could I do?

Registration was not necessary for me but my parents wanted it. People who had seen us together had questions. I was perfectly fine with her being my world. But as she went away she would lie and lie just like before. Untill one day she just turned off every thing after almost 4.5 years saying I'm not happy with you and so much more. I had an answer to her every question. Also anger was the bigger part in them though never without logic.

It has been many months since she wouldn't talk to me properly and sometimes just block right away. As in Pakistan one person can only have 4 Sim cards if you want new you have to go to headquarters and deactivate old one and get a new one. A lazy person like me has bought about 10 or 11 sims uptill now just for her. She would just block them without even a little humanity.

I got a news one time that I don't want to disclose here but it had some true signs, I didn't let it stop me. Seems like I am honorless when it comes to her. And just about last night she told me about someone else that she is living in a couple relation and I should just die. Well believe me if I wasn't religious I would've killed myself. But that upbringing saved me. But how can she do that? She was married to me I mean she still is. The pain was massive when I was left all alone but it keeps increasing. I'm suffering so bad I don't know what to do. I want just her and she is the one who said ine should kill someone rather than cheating. How people can be so ruthless? I see no light for me ahead. I have been to mental health institution but it didn't help. I have a heart problem now, blood has shot upto my eyes and sometimes I feel cold sensations in my head. I can't breath sometimes and there are twitches on my eyes and lips. I think I'm dying but why doesn't it affect her. I want nothing more than her in my life. I just wish she would change just the way I have tried for 5 years.

126,NSFW: Moody yet again," .....Today was just like all the other days the last two months. I wake up and I’m feeling tired and down. I try to wake up to music that’s uplifting. But it seems my mind is used to hearing music and can override it. 5 minutes into being awake the memories start flooding in. I tell myself everything’s gonna be OK, my apartment is peaceful and I’m safe. Due to my meds I sleep a lot and have fatigue. What I hate about bipolar the most, all the ideas I had yesterday and the travel plans, everything just feels dull and a waste of my time. My mind will start conjuring up fears and things that could happen and go wrong while traveling. Lately I’ve been waking up and thinking damn I’m still breathing. I really wish I could turn my day upside down and right side up. When I’m sober I’m usually Very serious, thinking hard, generally afraid, a type of doom that’s letting me know something bad is gonna happen and to anticipate it. It’s so strange to be hypomanic, I have these moments throughout today of pure bliss, happiness, I make plans for my future, I feel optimistic, I don’t worry so much about money. It just seems like a really difficult way of living having one foot feeling like you’re 6 feet under, dancing with your other foot. Having two extremes, is mentally exhausting, I don’t like that my thoughts are generally negative and intrusive.

I told myself if I should stand as planet another year and and see what it brings. Maybe it’ll change my life around to be financially independent again. But maybe I’m just too sick to work full time. The bipolar brain does not want to speak with my body. It’s overwhelmingly lazy, I have to push myself to do anything. Always fighting with my mind like come on let’s go outside let’s do something, and it just doesn’t wanna get off the bed. I remember working more than 8 hours a day three or four years ago, I would feel tired, but I would do it again the next day for months. Ever since the physical abuse, it felt like the cherry on top for 2023. This year started out a nightmare. I want to believe things are gonna get better, that the ideations will go away, How is it even possible that the human brain can conceive so much scary images and ideas and thoughts. It’s really hard to take care of myself by myself. All of my abusers were the people closest to me who told me they loved me. I find myself yet again in a place where I am alone. I don’t feel lonely in the sense that I don’t have any social life.

I feel like I failed at finding caring people to be in my life. I spent decades of my life helping everyone around me, but now I have no support. I’ve been denied disability insurance, my church won’t help either, on top of the fact that they ghosted me, which always leads me down the road to realize and God is a myth. 34 I’ve been praying my whole life, If god is in my life, Why would he let men put their hands on me. Do I not have a single angel to keep me away from violence. It’s a really dark place when all you’ve had was prayer and God to help you feel that you’re not alone. I find comfort in knowing that many people today struggle with the same feelings that I do. I know it means that you can live with this illness for years. I just don’t want to. For five years I’ve been battling the world’s worst mental illness. 20 medications in and I realized they’re never going to work. The problem is physical, humans around me behave like beasts, they will degrade, belittle, curse, yell, throw things, self harm, and tell me things I really don’t wanna hear.

I can’t stand meeting new people, and having them break down in front of me, suicidal, hating their life and being unable to support me because they are already in the dark. Death seems to be all around me, it feels so close like it’s on my fingertips. My father died by suicide. He suffered the same pain that I suffer, my mother has a anger disorder, my brother has schizophrenia and does now physically abusive on top of having been verbally abusive for 10 years now. My best friend was suicidal, and my ex. All of this happen in less than 12 months. I’m watching people around me falling apart.. I’m seeing human minds so altered that there’s no going back to healing. My brother will never accept help. I have to somehow live with this truth that I’ve lost him. My own mother will put me in harm’s way to take care of her son. She knows he’s abusive and puts up with it and ignores it and expects me to do the same. We are Bosnian after all, violence in our DNA. I remember wishing my parents would break up because I can’t listen to the fighting anymore.

I’m going to self medicate because it’s the only thing that can get me out of this negative train of thoughts. My psych meds help but I still end up writing things like this after taking lamicdal and Seroquel. I don’t like the fact that I cant openly talk about my self medicating on this forum. All my posts get taken down. In hopes that no one will copy what I am doing and end up making their emotions worse. But as a 34 yo adult I can take whatever I want. Microdosing is saving my life, but it may not work for everyone. The doctors are split, some pro, some against. I don’t have anything else to drag me out of this. When you’ve done everything the docs asked u to and the therapists. DBT CBT, gym, food, sleep, socialize, hobbies, etc. But everyday you still wake up like this then what is next to help heal? 

It feels like my heart is in a million pieces and I have to weld it together, and the best I can do is put tape around it. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I just don’t have the money to go to inpatient im stuck in asia. I can barely work but I do because it allows me to notice my productivity is not completely lost. I just don’t recognize myself anymore. The passion comes and goes, I can’t start a business when apathy overcomes me multiple times a day. So damn intrusive, even while on the treadmill or talking to a friend or listening to my favorite songs. My whole day is filled with triggers and me telling myself to ignore the negative thoughts. 

But they rush in like an ocean wave, over and over and over again. Its really exhausting way to live. I fully understand why my dad did what he did. I am in his shoes now 20 years later and I cannot be in the vicinity of my mother, brother, family, ex’s. I hate it when they reach out. I can’t make sense of anything. Schizophrenia is scary. One day he will want to hurt me, two months later I get “were worried about you” emails. They will never leave me alone. 

I as a family oriented person always get pulled back into their web. My mom had a stroke in January, and yes its heart breaking even though shes the root of all my drama. I wanted to help but I was yet again treated like a secretary and bossed around. I think sometimes its possible for me to let go mentally and accept all things come to an end. Can I co-exist knowing what they did to me for the foreseeable future? I don’t have a good therapist mine is in chemo. I don’t have ability to go back to cali. I am broke and barely getting by. But I am.

I just can’t figure out how to regulate this darkness. .. ... ..",1681543285.0
127,Depression and Brain Fog since I was 11. I'm 27 now. Advice?,"\[MtF\] The medication 'Seroquel' seemed to be the only thing that 'cured' it (October, 2022). And to be honest, it made me feel like a superhero at times, haha; I mean, for the first time, it felt like my brain was actually functioning the way it was supposed to. The world was vibrant and exciting, and my thoughts were rapid and clear. Sure, I was a bit eccentric on it, but I've always been.

Having said that, I developed alopecia that I believe was the result of this medication (or a combination—and further Googling seems to reinforce that). They switched me over to 'Risperidone' because I was still 'too hyper'. Then, to a combination of 'Seroquel' and 'Abilify', which is when I started shedding my hair significantly. Since then (December, 2022), I dropped it only on estradiol. It's hard to say what the specific cause was, exactly.  


It's growing back now, but I really don't want to lose my hair again. It's very important to me. But it feels like a 'Catch 22', because I absolutely can't function with this massive brain fog.

128,New member,"I am new to this group. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for pretty much the entirety of my life (33f). There’s been a large amount of events the lead me here…childhood abandonment, domestic abuse in an adult relationship of mine, and just all of the things that stem from that. 
Last year I left my abuser after being on and off for 8 years. Since then I have struggled with ptsd on top of the depression and anxiety. I started seeing a therapist, got on medication. Everything went alright for a while but I left therapy because I felt it was making me feel more depressed. My doctor recommended a new therapist and I just never got back in it. 
Well lately, my depression is out of control. I’m wildly unhappy in life and my normal cope is to just ride out the wave and survive until I feel ok again. But lately…it’s not working. Meds are not working, my coping isn’t working. I’ve felt like life is pointless lately, like I’m just so tired of always having to be strong for myself and saying this will pass and I’ll feel better again. I just don’t have that same strength this time. I did reach out to a friend, who recommended I talk to a doctor.

133,Suicide chatline and reasons you might be scared to talk to them,"If the suicide lifeline is available in your country and you want someone to vent to you may actually benefit from speaking to them if you have not already tried it. 

If you speak to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline from the website (not text) and use a vpn (which you can easily find and download for free) I am almost 100% certain they cannot find your location. I have talked to them many times before and they have implied that they might need to alert authorities, but no one has ever came. Just make sure the vpn is working.

And of course there are some who have had negative experiences with the lifeline, and im not trying to say it will fix your problems, but I just wanted to highlight that it actually can be helpful if you would like to talk to someone about what you are struggling with, and to use a vpn if you were worried about police or anyone being involved.",1681473047.0

I rarely ever felt happiness and that goes all the way back to childhood, my thoughts get too dark sometimes even for me, but thats just another bad day, i will endure thousand hells before i give up, the only thing i could never do is permanently break the hearts of the few people i have in my life.

138,Down,"Hello, I’m really struggling at the moment. This past weekend I was hospitalized due to a severe kidney infection that had me going into septic shock. I also had a 4mm kidney stone and a UTI at the same time. My body was basically shutting down, my blood pressure wasn’t raising. I was dying pretty much. I was in the hospital for days. My mom was 3 minutes away. Not miles. MINUTES. She never came to see me. My father ignored my calls. No one cared My friends didn’t show. I sat there alone unless my bf was there or his mom. I am out of the hospital, back to work immediately because even almost dying doesn’t give you a break off of work. My mother is not supportive. No help to me. My dad told me he was sad he heard on fb that I was hospitalized… he ignored my call.. I couldn’t tell him… idk I just already suffer from depression and ptsd. My partner has bipolar and he literally this month, just came out of a 6 month manic episode where he verbally berated me, slept with other women, spent all his money, didn’t come home for days. It was awful. He finally comes down from his episode and boom I almost die. Now he’s depressed because his crash is here and I feel I can’t even be sad about my stuff.

140,"I have a partner with depression, and I'm not sure what to do","I am a 29-year-old man dating a 25-year-old woman suffering from depression.

Our 1st year was really great. So great that she was hinting at marriage, and we were looking at moving in together. However, some things have changed in the past 6 months. Slowly, she seems to be having more sad days than happy days. Her friends are not reaching out and hanging out with her anymore, and she is desperate for relationships. She feels trapped financially (Though is doing VERY well for her age) and is viewing life through a lens of pessimism. It seems that this has leaked into our relationship now, as she never talks about our future anymore. She constantly uses ""I"" statements and has admitted to doubting my cleanliness/financial abilities(she earns more). She thinks we want different things, and said that ""something is missing"" tonight over the phone. I can tell that she is unhappy, and I can see it affecting not only me but others around her.

Last week she made me cry by telling me all of her doubts about my abilities. I shifted perspective, and collected myself (after crying/venting and thinking about it for a day lol). I know that I'm ready for the next step better than she does, so I allowed myself to blame her doubts on her darkening perspective of life. Tonight we talked on the phone and she ended up crying as she was talking about therapy a while back. I asked if she was still considering it, and that was when she told me that she was scared of opening up to new people. She sobbed loudly and told me that she had to go. I told her I loved her and she said ""bye"" and hung up the phone.

Our life has not been exciting in these last 6 months. We have both been saving our money for a very expensive Europe Trip (Our first International Trip together). I work and am back in school thanks to injuries and a career change. I am self-employed and I do very well working little at the moment as I work towards my degree. I really love this woman, and life together was once really good. We never really had fights despite disagreeing on things as people do.

I will also mention that I moved back home after my injury. I have a great relationship with my parents and we make it work as we are all adults now. Part of me wonders if she wants someone who is ""complete"" and making big money as that seems to be her focus. She seems to want a house more than anything in the world. We can't afford that yet, and it could be a couple more years until we do at this rate in this climate (BC, Canada).

I don't know what I should do. She grew up in a family that was not communicative, and I have always been leading as the open communicator in this relationship. I feel like she is too scared to end things, and that she has been hiding more feelings from me. She is so exceptional in so many ways, but I feel that nothing will ever make her happy. I was previously told I had an anxious attachment style from a previous relationship that ended badly with a girl who also had anxiety/depression. Hence, this is my second time having a girlfriend with depression. I feel like I should be better at this by now... but I'm starting to have my own doubts that I'm the right one for her. I love her to bits, but I really want to do what is best for her and what is best for me.

I will be giving her space for the time being.

PS. She is not on any medications (was once, but avoids them)

141,Why do I punish myself and Why do I don’t feel enough,"Hi I am a person living in an economically devastated country with a really average cv and a about to be graduated status.

144,I don't know what to do,"So, for context, I've approached this subreddit about my ex semi recently. I'm still very attached to both her and her daughter. She's still seeing the guy I mentioned. She's mentioned having a talk with him soon and that if he doesn't change, she's out. But I'm also very concerned for the extremely scarce trust I've seen on his part. Last night, they video chatted and he got her to show around her room, in the hall, and that I was in the living room, far away from her. My main concern is why on earth does she not see how little, if any, trust he has in her? I mean, isn't that one of the foundational qualities needed in a relationship?

Yes, I still want her back. I've never met anyone like her. She's headstrong, independent, fierce, kind, loving, loyal. I love her and her daughter to bits. But I'm beginning to be concerned this will continue into something much more toxic down the line.

145,I need help,"This is my first official reddit post. I originally made this account to read AITAs and such and help people. I 21 female find myself yearning to at least tell someone how I feel. I'm someone who tends to bottle their feelings so its hard getting them out usually but sometimes they desperately need an outlet. Its becoming more and more apparent to me however, that it really feels like I have no one. I come from a strict religious household and being open and honest about your life and feelings will only result in a religious lecture. So they're out of the picture in terms of being able to talk to them. I have a few friends i guess, none but 2 I guess I could talk to. One of them being my boyfriend but we've been butting heads a lot and it just makes everything feel a lot heavier than it already is. The other is my friend from middle school, we are very close best friends i think maybe im not sure. I feel they are closer to me than i feel to them. I'd like to feel close to them but im afraid of sudden rejection if that makes sense. Maybe she wont want to be friends anymore if I tell  her what's up or something bad. I just don't trust easily at all. Anyways I have BPD, and moderate to severe depression but who doesn't at this point (I am diagnosed btw i am not self diagnosing, I know that's some like the clarification) anyway. I just feel fucking alone, I feel like i cannot be honest with the people around me just completely out of fear of being viewed as an annoying cringe or a burden. I have a trauma filled past as most people do nowadays but I don't want to get into the gory details atm. I've attempted numerous times before starting from the age of 9 till about 19/20. I am 21 now so I haven't made an attempt but that doesn't mean I'm not itching to. At this point I'm being consumed by every negative thought, feeling, urge, insecurity, etc. I have been feeling this way for a while. I just feel useless, worthless and empty. I truly pity the people who are even slightly in my life for just having to be around me. I try to not make it too obvious that I want to fucking kill myself. My boyfriend does know there have been times where I have these episodes where I cannot control my brain is what it feels like and I lash out entirely and go on about all the inner machinations of my mind that scream these awful things at me, but I tell him all these things. He is sweet for listening to me but I don't think he fully gets what I am getting at when I have these turmoils.  He also has his own trauma and things he needs to sort out and I try to stay supportive and act like nothings wrong when in reality  Im genuinely physically am pained from my mental and emotional mindset in most instances. All in all I don't know what to do with myself at this point. I yearn for the simpler times but back then I felt the same at young age. I feel alone, pathetic and empty and so much more. What should I do? Am I pushing everyone away? Should I keep faking it till I make it or just let go and give up. That last option sounds more and more appealing everyday. Please help.",1681467005.0

148,My story,"I've battled with depression all my life, I was raised by my mother who gave birth to me at the age of 15 ( was pregnant at 14). I'm not going to blame my upbringing for my mental health and the space I found myself in, but I am now 26 (turning 27 this year) and even though I have everything I could ask for (family, wife, house) nothing can fix the dark hole inside of me and I continue to struggle day to day, and always feel like the world is against me. I always question why things happen to me and no-one else. I always questioned God. I think a big thing that has held me back is not seeing and realizing the mitigating factors to as to which why i feel this way, and after researching and creating this video in which I broke down into a small story- have realized alot. And seen how much social media has affected me from a young age, battling with personas and creating egos only to shut down who i really am. I now am a grown man searching for his identity when this was meant to be done over a decade ago, I've been in and out the ringer. Spent time in jail, gangs. I lived a high life and created my social circle around these dark people i strived to be like because that is what was glorified at the time. I now have left them friends and associates behind and I am blessed to have found my wife because I could solemny swear that I am- and was so lonely. Traumas, anxiety, chronic faitugue. All of these things now demonizing my life and if I had knew the impact it would all have when creating an account on social media-  I would not have. The path and journey all began when social media arrived, I was a excelling student ahead of my age since right back in primary. In high school that all changed when I strived to be something that i'm not and put so many years into it to the point of where I am now. I am a indigineous from New Zealand and my name holds different vowels and would sound rather strange to european folk and it was hard when social media came and i felt like i had to hold a persona, I no longer wanted to achieve and receive awards or certificates because standing in a auditorium of 1000 students i would get so anxious they would call my name out and I would deal with the laughter and mockery. It turned ultimately into hating myself and self sabotaging to the point i wanted to kill myself many occasions. In and out of jail and constantly seperated from my family. I am now doing what i need to do to better myself but have made this video as I want people to know the risk they are taking when pursuing social media dependance as you can get endorphins from other things that wont such a toll on you in the long run. No pressure of watching I just thought i would finally speak and share some of my story while also trying to help others. The support would be amazing, thank you for your time and reading this.

149,34F depressed AF,"Hi everyone. I have been going thoughhhh it the last few months. Was scapegoated at work and lost my job, struggled for 3.5 months to find a new one which I start on monday, but had to get 3 part time jobs in a warehouse, then a hotel housekeeping department, then a front desk position. 

I was fired from the warehouse because I couldn't keep up, it was 8 hours non stop physical labor. 

Had to flee the housekeeping job because I was being harassed and physically intimidated by a supervisor

Now started a front desk job with really nice people (but OH SO boring) for 2 weeks before I finally start a new full time salaried position which I am not really excited about. They were just the first to make an offer. But they do seem kind.

Anyway I'm depressed a pretty much single 34 year old who has lost my motivation, ambition, and desire to achieve I guess.

My pseudo boyfriend is really not the best partner though I do love him; i think he will not make a good husband or partner unfortunately:( as he Is quite self centered, contributes nothing to the relationship, and very unreliable. I do appreciate him though because he's been my only friend for the last two years.

I feel extremely depressed it's my second year living on my own after being abandoned and tossed out of my families lives.. and j just feel shitty tonight.

152,Gift/gesture for my cousin?,"To context the relationship a little:

Who is there? there’s me (25F) as the youngest of my siblings, my sister (29M) and my bro (27M), and there’s my first cousins: the one I’m posting about (27F), her brother (25M) and her sister (21F). 

The families:  We all grew up pretty close when we were young and did a lot of stuff together between the two families like trips to the zoo, weekends away for non-abroad holidays. As we grew older, there was a distance there as each family was going through their own things but my grandparents were the glue of the family. They have both since passed within the past 5 years and it’s been tough on both families and we’ve grown apart. My family have tried to make efforts to continue maintaining some of that closeness from before but their family isn’t interested in doing anything with us anymore. 

Us 4 girls:  my two cousins were raised to look up to my sister and their parents have always put her on such a high pedestal so my cousins have a lot of love and respect for her. So they go above and beyond she’s home. In contrast, they don’t have a lot of time or respect for me as a person and no real care to ever want to do anything with me apart from casual chit chat/small talk when they come over for someone’s birthday, which doesn’t really happen much anymore either. It’s frustrating and upsetting to see such a clear cut contrast between how they see and treat my sister vs me but regardless I write this post asking for advice.

The current situation:  My cousin recently reached out to my sister saying she has been having a very hard time with her fiancé and in-laws to the point where she is very depressed, handed in her notice at work, can’t remember to take her meds, forgets conversations 10mins after having them, doesn’t want to leave the house or see anyone, won’t speak to her siblings, fiancé isn’t saying much to her. My sister, as a doctor, has heavily medically advised her to seek help, maybe start some antidepressants, etc. and told her she can talk to any of us if she doesn’t want to talk to anyone at home. She has never come to me about anything good or bad, apart from ringing me a couple times for company when she was missing home in her first year of uni about 9 years ago. As much as my relationship with my cousin is what it is and I feel what I feel, I still want to do something like a gesture or a pick-me-up gift to say I’m thinking of her and let her know I’m here. My siblings and I have all gone through real heavy patches of depression so we know how intense it is, I just don’t know what to get her. She won’t want to see me if she doesn’t want to see anyone, especially given the nature of our relationship but I feel like I should do something. I just don’t know what. Because we’ve been distant for a while and she hasn’t really spent much time with us in years, I don’t even know what hobbies and interests she has anymore. I was thinking maybe some self-care stuff like face masks bc I know she does them, maybe some chocolates, of course a note, otherwise I’m stuck. I’d get something more personal but I somehow haven’t retained many memories of my childhood so I don’t remember a lot myself. I’d do scented candles but I don’t know what scents she likes and I don’t want her to end up using it for self harm. I don’t know if she’s self harming but just in case. Any suggestions?",1681445573.0
153,A debate on this curse,"Man, when given this curse,
tends to walk quietly- 
And even when they shout for help,
the external expression that can be heard-
is near infitely more quiet and impure
than the wails of despair that echo internaly.

Deafend by his wails, he can 
not hear his bretheren's attempt at savior-
and so outside it appears he rejected help.
Confused, are these kind souls, 
and eventualy they have to move on,
further feeding his pain.

Aye, this curse I talk of can not be 
starved, as it feeds itself- 
Only can the brightest light 
stave the darkest shadow.
One must find this light, 
And this light is heaven,
this light is Love.

But where is our Virgil? The hand that 
may guide us to the kingdom of heaven?
Dante could not ascend from hell by himself. That mission, near impossible, I own.

Perhaps our Virgil is faith and acceptance?
Perhaps he is right here beside me.
If this is so, than all is not lost-
I will walk through the fires of annihilation, 
and my face will be wiped clean by my Beatrice,
and I can witness her true beauty and compassion.
Love, acceptance and forgivness may I percieve and give-
and only then would I be born again.",1681420478.0
154,How to do schoolwork when depressed?,"Hello everyone. I have been suffering from undiagnosed depression for almost a decade now. I'm in my last year of college (I only have 9 credits left) but I am slipping again, bad. 

It seems contradictory, but because the finish line is so close, it feels like it's farther than it has ever been. When I set out to do my schoolwork, I get this horrible pang of world ending anxiety about it. I think that I won't be able to finish, and that I'm not doing it right, and then can't focus at all, and then I usually end up not doing it. I am sabotaging myself. 

TLDR: basically, even though the biggest hurdles to graduating are basically out of the way, the little bit of school I have left seems like more than everything I've already been through. Do y'all have any tips on how to get this stuff done? I am very overwhelmed. I wonder if the prospect of figure out what I will do once I graduate is the background noise. I'm not sure.",1681427625.0
155,What Should I Do if He Says He'll Change?,"My ex-boyfriend and I were together for a year. He comes from a wealthier family, and was adopted when he was a baby. He was born on drugs so he has a lot of ongoing issues with impulse control, eating disorders, memory and learning issues, etc. When I met him, I was in my senior year of high school and he was in his junior year. I got him sober until I went to college. He still went to see me every weekend but as our year mark was about to hit, I found out that he had been cheating on me for a month with a girl he met at the smoke shop.

Our relationship was starting to get rocky for awhile. I didn't agree with a lot of his behavior but I loved him so I tried to stay patient. As time went on, my patience was wearing thin and it turned into anger and stonewalling. Our communication in the beginning was great and then became non-existent the same week he ran away with this girl.

For a month, he lied to this girl and said that I had killed myself a long time ago and it was hard for him to live with it. He lied about his name and said his birth parents were dead and that his adopted parents would lock him in a room. He said they wouldn't let him shower, and he begged to come see her. However, none of this was true. He lied about where he was from, his age, his job, etc. Just everything and he would see this girl every single day of the week (at night when he said he was going to bed) like clockwork. Meanwhile, I'm two hours away and he would only come see me once from Saturday-Sunday. He was even texting this girl the entire time we were in Virginia Beach for my birthday.

At the end of March, after he left my dorm on Sunday he completely ghosted me. When he finally did pick up the phone for me, I was angry and yelling about why he wasn't talking to me. He just hung up and said he needed a minute. I didn't hear from him again until Wednesday, when I told his mom about the situation. She looked through his phone, found out he was going to sneak out to see her again, and took his car away. When he went to school on Thursday, he just ran away with her. 

When they found him two days later, he had scratches all over his back from having sex with her and they found drugs in his socks. He was wearing her clothes and he was in really bad shape. The next day, his mom said he was sleeping with my picture under his head. They sent him to a rehab in Florida, and on his way there his location started to go off so I texted him. He was apologizing, saying he never loved her, that he always loved me, that he was willing to go through hell just to get our relationship back...He brought my pictures down there with him and things that I had gifted him.  He seems sorry but it's very confusing to me. Because I feel if he had never got caught, he would've continued doing it. He must've felt something for this girl, but he kept blaming his motive on drugs.

He said whenever he tried to speak to me I would look at him like less of a man. I feel as though whenever we would have normal conversations and I would offer solutions, he would never fix anything so I just stopped listening. And maybe that's my fault, but he didn't have to do what he did. I never cheated on him, and when I had opportunities I always thought about him and walked away from the situation. But the first chance he got, he took it.

So what do I do? He's been writing me letters about how he feels alone, stripped and violated of his rights, how he's been fading in and out of consciousness, and how much he loves me and thinks of all our memories we shared. I want to fix things but I don't think I can ever look past what he did. He completely broke my heart, and I even had to go to the hospital because I wasn't eating or sleeping. I still love him, but I hate what he did. And I don't know if he's even genuine or if he'll ever change. Do I give him another chance or do I try my best to move on?",1681439775.0
156,I'm really struggling and I'm losing sight of a way out again,"I suffered from depression from the age of 14 to about 21.I'm 22 now, I feel like I have a really bad hand dealt to me. Physically abusive father and Narcissistic physiologically abusive mother, both contributed to my mental instability. At 18 I cut them off and I was on my own with a physically abusive and physiologically abusive girlfriend (Best of both worlds I know). We both had issues but I put up with it, I felt like I loved her and always tried to solve all of our problems while working on my own. If I'm being honest it defiantly worked at helping me overcome depression. However I had to find ways to feed and house myself. I worked as a nurse and wasn't paid enough to keep up with costs. I always made sure to pay rent instead of paying for enough food, it eventually caught up with me. I staved for months around 6 months to be precise. By the end of last year I couldn't work anymore, I had staved myself to the point where I couldn't work without fainting from standing up. When I couldn't pay rent I felt like it was the end, I just wanted to die, not because I was depressed but because I couldn't live like this and can't handle the stress. I tried to kill myself, my girlfriend called an ambulance and I was taken to a psych ward where they weighed me. I haven't been weighed in a long time and I was around 40kg (88 pounds) And was put on a refeeding program. I was there for three weeks where they got me on financial help. With that I was able to somehow get a room with it. Since then I've been living off it for rent and food, barely scraping by. I moved to a place that's a hotel in the summer. I was going to move in the summer with my girlfriend so living expenses would be manageable. However I broke up with her about two weeks ago and now I have less than two months before I'm kicked out and won't have a way to get enough money to find somewhere new. I feel like I'm going back to where I was 6 months ago and I can't do that again. I don't want to beg my ex to get back together after I left her with good reason. However I don't know how many options I have left, I'm struggling to see a way out of this. I'm seeing a Therapist Monday for the first time that was set up when I was in a ward 5 months ago, I can't see them helping when my problems aren't purely solved with mentality.",1681434201.0

I’m so sick of working a shit ton of hours only to barely pay rent. I’m sick of my mental health being in the shitter, and I’m just now realizing that in addition to anxiety, depression, and ptsd, I might also have ADHD (primarily inattentive) and the fight for meds for it is a constant fucking battle. But I keep forgetting things at work and at home…
I recently forgot something important during an intimate moment with my girlfriend and she got really upset and I went into freeze reasponse. She took it as me not caring so she purposely tossed a couple dish towels at me and guilted me because she did a lot of chores today and the least I could do is remember the one thing I needed to. So like, I felt as bad as I usually do when this happens but also she went out of her way to fuck me up more. I’m gonna stop talking before this becomes a huge rant but it hurts. So bad. I live in the Midwest United States and I swear I wouldn’t be here if the weather didn’t improve this week. I’m so sick of trying in every part of my life. I’m exhausted. I miss by best friend that took her life. She’d be 27 today. I really hope I can get diagnosed with ADHD and hopefully try strayers because I keep forgetting things and it’s honestly hard to hear the specific words people say sometimes. I think my hyper vigilance from anxiety masked the inattentive ADHD for a while.

I just feel so done. I don’t think im a threat to myself but I did scratch myself with tweezers the other day. Im too scared to go any farther. It’s not even I wanna die and make a big deal.

My partner doesn't love me anymore because of a mistake I made (not about cheating). They are unable to forgive me. I can't blame them as it's their call if they are able to forgive me or not. And they are really trying. I see that struggle everyday. But it's been 18 months now, and I feel so broken. I've always had depression issues, and it's getting much worse. The cold shoulder that I get, the look I see in their eyes which says there isn't even any attraction left (I've put on quite some weight) - all of it has destroyed me. But I can't off myself. I can't do that to my family.

162,Feeling alone and like I do nothing right,"
I know that sounds vague and like something every person feels. 
To better explain myself, long story short at least, I’m a 33 year old guy and the thing I am a fan of most is Nintendo (one of a few examples perhaps). I love to play Mario Kart, the music makes me smile, and loved the new movie when I saw it with my child.
That being said, I have two jobs currently and absolutely no one else is like me. If they even enjoy games it’s call of duty or some basketball game. I always feel like the weirdo and while I am fairly cool with myself being different and fun in my own way, it has caused me to sort of back up and not feel like myself. Like I have no idea how to act with these people and despite me considering myself fairly easy to get along with, it is difficult to find friends (outside of online communities). 
Anyone else have similar experiences?

Along with all that, I feel like everything I do is wrong. Have had major trouble learning new things, forgetting everything I was told, plain on looking like I’m not even trying when I am, etc.",1681414832.0
163,Feeling completely lost in life,"(I didnt know which flair to use, so just consider this flair to include all relevant flairs) I don't really know if it qualifies as depression, but I've finally figured out how I've been feeling. I feel lost, like I'm just drifting through life. I go to work cuz it's expected of me and I can't survive without money, but I can barely stay motivated enough to finish the day. And yet when I have days off, I feel even more empty, like everything I do is pointless and is just passing the time away. I used to love playing games, but these days I don't REALLY enjoy them anyway. Even my games don't provide any entertainment, but I still buy more just to pass the time away. I tell myself to go for a walk or something, but I just can never actually do it. I don't even have any friends to hang out with, nor do I feel particularly inclined to go find any. My girlfriend lives almost 2 hours away and only rarely answers my calls, so really I'm completely alone. I'm mostly an introvert so that should be fine, but it's not because I just start thinking when I'm alone, and I start to realize that nothing I'm doing matters, and nothing I will do will ever matter. I can't advance in my Job because of my autism created bad habits that I just can't seem to shake, so I'm just surviving as a part time bagger, and I'll have nowhere to go when my parents eventually get too old to keep taking care of me. I can't succeed, and I can't really bring myself to try. Starting tomorrow, I have 2 days off from work, and I'm dreading that, because that's 2 whole days alone with my thoughts and I just don't want to leave my bed.

She had a son who was two when we started dating and have loved and raised him as my own. We were never married and when his bio dad got back in the picture we agreed his aunt would file for guardianship since we just a house and I wasn't sure what to do. I packed my things and moved 30 mins away from family to be closer to him. Over the past year I healed physically, mentally and emotionally I got back into the dating game and faced hostility from her family. They kept taking my visits away and October of last year was told by the aunt to leave them alone. I didn't see him for 5 months, my depression worsened,I got ptsd and was in a dark place. In March she reached out and told me how miserable he is and how he is suffering in school because he missed me. Lately my landlord has been a terror,getting on me about the house not being cleaned (it's cluttered but not messy). This Tuesday she sent me a letter telling me she is terminating our lease and when I told her I'd go to court she screamed and yelled in the front lawn and I ended up calling the cops. Yesterday I went to my stepsons baseball practice and was told by his uncle ( who is friends with the landlord and put a word in for her to let me live in her house) that since I fucked her over and messed up her house I was never to see my stepson again. Last night,I wanted to end it all. I called my family to help me. They said I need to walk away I can't keep doing this to myself. I'm in my car at work wanting to cry but keeping it together so I don't have to explain this. I'm miserable, depressed, I'm not suicidal but I don't want to keep feeling this way.

I try to cope with different coping mechanisms . I smoke , binge eat junk foods , constantly daydream or masturbate in order to cope from my feelings and it's been 5 years since I am doing so . I am seeing the therapist but that just feels like temporary reassurance .

169,"After leaving a bad relationship, I feel even worse than before . Please offer a kind word.","I (25F) left a malignant narcissist(36M). He groomed me at 19 when he was 30. Got me pregnant. Abused me mentally, physically and sexually. Somehow I developed Stockholm syndrome because I thought I loved him and I only finally left after I found out about the rampant cheating, not because of the other abuse. No I do not want him back, but my situation just sucks. I am now a single mom in my 20s with barely anything to my name, stuck in a shithole apartment with cockroaches. (I was a stay at home mom when I left) 

When I found out he cheated with countless women, because he SA’d one of them, he manipulated me in my heartbroken state to not report him as well, since he’s done it to me. He manipúlated me into not telling other people, not outing him like I wish I did, and used my sadness and pain to coax sex out of me, which I see now was predatory and manipulative. 


After I left, he gave the sob story to his boss and he got a nicer, better apartment than before through the employer. His family mailed him care packages and food and call every week to check in and nobody gave a shit about me and our daughter, struggling to make it through the trauma and pay bills. 

Meanwhile, I had to move back to the neighborhood of my toxic family, where I was both laughed at when sharing news of what happened AND blamed for my mother’s subsequent stroke. Apparently I am to blame for the stroke she had after I told my family I needed to come home and why. I work as a miserable overworked teacher for a virtual school and just barely make enough money to get by. I started working part time on the side for a home improvement company in hopes I could make a better life for my daughter and I. It turned out the guy who hired me just wanted to sleep with me. He sexually harassed me to come to his house for sleepovers, offered compensation and gifts, and when I ultimately rejected him I no longer had a job with him. 

I feel like everything in my life has taken a major downgrade since leaving while my ex has basically faced none of these consequences. Everyone says life gets better when you leave the narcissist. I feel more and more depressed every day. No, I don’t want him back. I just want a better living situation.",1681367584.0

I'm not diagnosed with anything but I think I could say that I have anxiety. I just started to work a week ago and I'm scared about what the future might hold. I'm afraid of making mistakes, and I have no confidence that I'm going to do a good job no matter what I try. I also have to communicate and socialize, which is something I'm very afraid of, but it is necessary to do it in my line of work. I'm honestly scared and I've been crying in my room without anyone to talk to. I've been planning on visiting a therapist but due to financial problems, that might take a while. Sometimes I have the urge to just run away but theres also a part of me that wishes to stay and continue because I want to change myself (and also to help my family financially). I am honestly lost.

171,Therapist suggested I go on SSRIs for a bit. I’m not sure how I feel about it.,"I was diagnosed with depression 7-8 months ago. Have lived with anxiety for almost a decade. 

Took some time off work, moved in with family, got disciplined about what I eat and exercising, have worked with a therapist for over a year now and I see a lot of positive changes in my perspective and symptoms. 

I’m back to base where I stay by myself and back to work. Things are not like they were before but it’s definitely not great wrt how I feel at times and it’s exhausting looking out for episodes and working through them (although they are shorter and I’m better equipped to handle them and I’m proud of myself for getting to this place). 

Had a depressive episode this past week and today my therapist suggested that I should try getting on SSRIs, since it isn’t fair to me to go through a harder way of doing life for extended periods of time. 

I’ve heard some horror stories about SSRIs and it’s very scary to feel out of control for how things might change inside my body and brain.

172,Would claiming a mental health disability help in getting a job after several years of unemployment due to severe depression?,"I have a question about claiming a mental health disability on job applications. I'm finally in a place where I'm able to work again, after a multi-year gap of not being able to. Needless to say this gap is a huge hurdle for getting hired. Does indicating a mental health disability potentially help in explaining that gap? I'm in the US. 

There are several pieces to that question:

1) Would it legally mean that potential employers couldn't use that gap as a reason not to hire me? This would help most in getting past gatekeepers in HR / recruitment agencies, who have to be more consciousness about this. If I can get to the interview stage, I'm confident I can do well. 

2) What documentation would I need to provide to support this claim? Is it something my psychiatrist could retroactively certify? I've only recently gotten my life together enough to think about this question. 

3) I'm under no illusion that indicating a mental health disability wouldn't end up working against me, as it could just prompt a potential employer to come up with alternate reasons to reject my initial application. 

As a little background, I was working in a UX Director level role at a large creative agency, with a really solid career, portfolio, and clients.

176,Free digital treatment to reduce social anxiety (clinical research study),"Hey there, I wanted to share [this link](https://fsu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8v6OFegLmnh5dt4) for a free social anxiety self-help treatment that my research lab is offering as part of a research study. I know firsthand how hard it can be to find something that works, especially something that's also halfway affordable. That's what we're trying to provide with this experimental treatment.

It essentially works by having folks consciously reduce specific ""[safety behaviors](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/112ld52/people_with_social_anxiety_tend_to_engage_in/)"" that we think may subtly maintain symptoms of anxiety. The idea is that just by monitoring and reducing these safety behaviors, you can reduce your social anxiety. I know it sounds simple, but we’ve seen it work in a previous study we’ve run. We also offer modest monetary compensation for time spent completing surveys (a chance at receiving one of ten $20 Amazon gift cards).

Participants must be at least 18 and be in the US due to restrictions around platform usage. If you are interested, please use this link to check your eligibility:

177,After knowing my story is it ok to ever give up on life? Anyone have any advice on how to get through this or how to get better?,"I got diagnosed with depression when I was 6, I am 17 now I've been in treatment for over a decade I have multiple other mental health disorders some of which have improved or don't affect me as much as my depression but some affect me a lot such as I have generalized anxiety disorder I take medicine for, and it helps a little but I still get so anxious sometimes I just can’t do anything because I’m worrying so much. I also have another disorder that I would rather not name because it is very stigmatized and I don’t want people thinking differently of me because of the disorder but it definitely just makes things even harder for me. But ever since I was little i was always told I would feel better now it’s 11 years later I've tried over 30 different medicines for depression and my depression has never gotten better infact it's gotten worse. and now I have stage 3 kidney disease because of lithium toxicity which was one of the medicines I was on i tried esketamine but had to come off because it wasn't working and my kidneys where at risk. Ive been involuntarily hospitalized around 10 times one of which at a 3 month facility none of which helped. Ive also tried natural things such as working out coping skills and multiple types of therapy’s. Ive intentionally overdosed a handful of times and have other suicide attempts. Ive dealt with non suicidal self harm since I was 7 and have scars all over my body so I always have almost all of my body covered and it gets hot especially because I live in Florida. 
Ive been bullied extremely when I was younger physically emotionally and I’ve dealt with SA when I was in the 2nd grade And all those things affect how I view other people today, I’m constantly scared when I see people I don’t know and I have severe trust issues. Most of my friends have stopped liking me because once they saw my problems they left and now I’m even more alone. I'm always scared and It feeds into my depression. I recently got kicked out of my school because they think I'm unsafe for myself. Since I have been kicked out of my school my self harm issues have been a lot worse and Im completely isolated because that was my only source of socializing. My school is not a regular school it is a autism center I was going to because I'm high functioning on the spectrum and other schools did not work for me I’ve tried a lot of different schools. now I have nowhere to go. Im alone in my room all day. I'm getting checked in for ECT in 3 weeks but don’t know if I can wait that long for help, and if that doesn’t work I possibly will have to go out of state for another long term treatment place. I want more then anything to feel better but at what point do i just realize that none of this is gonna work and I'm just getting false hope? I’ve tried so many things at this point and just don’t feel like I can function in society. I have a good family and I know I'm fortunate for that but I'm incapable of feeling happy and am miserable all the time I'm not currently suicidal because I have hope but I have no clue it it's realistic hope or false hope and if these things end up not working I will probably get suicidal thoughts again until they takeover. But I have to wait 3 weeks in my room before I can even start the treatment and I’m struggling to hang on. I mean I'm freaking 17 l've been dealing with this shit since I was 6 my first suicide attempt I was 11 l'm not a bad person why do i have to go through all this shit and can't get any better? I'm trying so hard to feel better but life just keeps making things worse. I mean at what point does it become justifiable for me to just say screw this and off myself? I obviously would rather feel better then do that but at what point should I know that it won’t happen I’ve been trying for over a decade now and things have gotten worse not better when is it reasonable for me to give up? I try looking at other peoples story's but can't find anyone's comparable to mine which makes me feel even more like i can't get better.

The first in December he said he was suicidal, took him to the ER and then 10 days inpatient treatment. 2nd was just a few weeks ago, again made reference to “when I’m dead”, so we called the crisis line and had home back to the ER and again 10 days inpatient treatment. Came home las week with the plan that he would do 2 weeks out patient day program to readjust and get more help without needing to stay overnights. 

He was supposed to start that today, but is refusing to go. And I can’t physically make him.  He says he doesn’t need help, we are just over reacting.  And he doesn’t trust us or even like us at this point. He did go to his regular therapy session on Monday but didn’t speak for at least 45 minutes. The Thera-asked me to be in his session to get a clearer picture of what went down leading to this last inpatient time.  He started out being open but not particularly honest. I gave my side and mentioned things he didn’t and how I felt about what he was doing and saying (Which includes being visited recently by the state police because of inappropriate conversations and pictures being sent to younger teens). At this point he went silent for the rest of the session.  

I’m at my wits end today. He won’t take the help he’s being offered, and he won’t let us, as parents, help him.  He’s at a point where he’s heading for bigger trouble. He just wants to be left alone and then he’ll behave and everything will be fine

His therapist says he does the silent treatment to punish us, and that would be fine if I didn’t feel like has standing at the edge of a cliff. My husband is at the point where he just wants to let him do whatever and the chips fall where they may, and son will just have to deal with the consequences. This is not how I feel, but I don’t know how to get through to son that we are trying to do what’s best for him.  

I know in my head that he has to want to help himself, but I can’t just stand by.  Any advise would be greatly appreciated.",1681308492.0

182,'SOMETIMES I FEEL SAD' - my project on Mental Health,"&#x200B;

['Sometimes I Feel Sad'](https://preview.redd.it/ugjt07mqkgta1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d1b4eb0c342918ec99e50317fbb0a4a960b1fdb)

Hey folks,

I wanted to share a little about my Mental Health journey. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember, and I’ve luckily been able to channel it into some creative outlets. Last year I created an audio-visual project called, [**‘Sometimes I Feel Sad’**](https://www.moalphotography.com/sifs); it was the purest way I could describe my depression and is often the answer I give when people ask, *“what’s wrong?”*. I share this with you all not for any likes or clout, but purely in the hope that it may resonate, or even help, with what some of you are going through.

It consists of 25 photographs and 1 song, you can view it all on [moalphotography.com/sifs](https://www.moalphotography.com/sifs).

Throughout the whole thing, I tried to contrast the feelings of child-like innocence with the rawness of the message; from the Disney-inspired music to the teddy bears in each image. When choosing what messages to write on the placards, I scoured a lot of sub-reddits on depression and the one over-arching, consistent theme was: *“I don’t want to die, I just want the pain to end”*. That’s the only one I used that wasn’t my own words, and one I know many people here relate to.

I don’t have any answers whatsoever, but I hope this project brings a tiny amount of solace to your day; and welcome any discussion.

187,Why do I hate myself despite being “successful”/achieving my goals?,"
Hey all, 

I don’t know why, but I find reaching out to strangers very comforting, and feel like I can be open without it changing the perception of me that the close friends/family have of me. 
I also want to state when I say successful, I mean I have reached the goals I set for myself and not in the sense of being an arrogant asshole. 

Just to start with some background, for the past 1-2 years, I have been really struggling with erratic sleep patterns, anxiety/depression, and strong suicide ideation. 
I started talking to a therapist around 4 months ago when the thoughts got very strong and I started meticulously planning the details. My therapist is a great guy, and I really enjoy talking to him/getting his advice. I also got prescribed bipolar/sleep(lexapro) medicine by a psychiatrist as I have a family history of it, but that didn’t seem to help much as my sleep was still ridiculous. In high school, I was always someone who went to bed late(around 12-1), but now in college, I am frequently pulling all nighters or going to bed at 4-6am and not waking up until 3-4pm. It really sucks because I am missing all my classes and the cycle continues as I have to keep up with work. I will say that I do make things worse as I tend to procrastinate all tests/hw, and I am stem major at a top 10 Uni. 
The thing is no one around me notices how miserable I am or I am able to hide it well due to my sarcastic/reserved personality with friends, and the fact I am doing well in school and internship wise.  I just got a big interview, and did well, which made me happy for all of 2 hours before I started to become suicidal again. I feel I am constantly beating up on myself and always so stressed out. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, even when I got into my Uni(a long term goal of mine), I wasn’t happy about it for long, and started obsessing over the next goal. I have tried to control these thoughts with meditation, medication, talking to people, and planning big lifestyle changes(gym,food, social media), but nothing works. I still hate myself and I just don’t get it. 
Its not like I have troubles in the social scene or family either. I have a loving girlfriend, great friends, and a close family. Yet I still feel so miserable with myself and that I am this big failure, or life isn’t worth living. 

I guess this was just a rant, but if at all possible, I’d just like to hear what everyone thinks about my situation? Does anyone else suffer from self deprecating thoughts? If you got over it, how? 
Tldr: 
Sorry if this made no sense, but to summarize: 
I feel like a failure despite measurable success, and that I should end my life to stop the feelings of hatred I have for myself and general unhappiness.",1681277762.0

192,What does it mean to be strong?,"""In the desert a traveler desperate for love wanted to die""
""Too exhausted, he was going to stop... but a hummingbird sang to him""
""When he heard its song... he immediately felt happy""
""Your beautiful energy to sing gave him love and hope to live""

Please read this text with an open mind, I hope that through these humble words, hope and strength will arise in your heart dear reader.

What is it to be strong? Many seek the answer to this question... day after day, people face their battles to find out what it means to be strong, experiencing all kinds of situations. Sometimes we can't stand the pressure, we feel lost, desolate, and weak. After all, what is the point of suffering in vain?

Most fall into addictions, rebellion, violence, or do nothing and just wait for time to pass? Many just can't go on.

Then the voices begin.... ""Why am I here?"", ""Why am I suffering?"", ""What difference do I make in this world?"". We start to argue with our consciousness... And it convinces us little by little that we are nothing and good for nothing... But deep down we know that this is just an illusion, deep down in our soul we know the real truth, but it is stuck there, chained by these voices that hover in our consciousness

So you start to struggle, you seek help from countless doctors and medicines, and yet you remain frustrated because nothing works. And this pushes you even further into the abyss from which you are trying to escape, giving us a false image that there is no solution.

I'm not going to say that the solution is an ultra advanced scientific method or even the dreamed-of salvation that many religions offer the world over.

But it has always been there, the solution is before your eyes? you look at it in the mirror every morning when you wake up.

You are the solution to your problems. Only you can solve them.

The first step must come from you, find the strength you need to keep trying. In your will, in your perseverance, in the events of history, in nature, in love, or even in the example of other people? Set your heart on fire, keep trying.

What does it mean to be strong? This is the answer I found: to be strong is not to have physical strength or to be intelligent, to be strong is always to stand up, to use your will and perseverance to overcome everything and keep going.

193,Need advice on a situation,"I am not in the most pleasant situation. I live in Russia, and let's just say the situation for guys my age is not the most pleasant. A new bill came out from our ""wonderful"" government about the military. Previously, people liable for military service used to receive summonses in paper form, but now this is done through the electronic system, and in fact all conscripts will receive it, unlike the paper one, if they ignore the summons it will be illegal to drive a car and cross the border. 

As a matter of fact, I did not want to join the army before the war, and even less after it began. Even the thought of killing someone terrifies me, and I have relatives in Ukraine. I was planning to move to a neighboring country, but I didn't want to do it until my girlfriend graduated from university. 

In fact, I was left with a choice of two evils: either to leave my girlfriend in Russia and leave right now alone (which I don't want at all) or to stay in the country, but after a short period in an extreme case to go to jail.

It took 10mg of narcan to bring me back and I was told that if they couldn’t get a pulse after that last 2mg dose that I was probably a goner. The pictures you see are from a car accident I got into. I was under the influence of 18mg of xanax, 120mg methadone, crack and probably heroin. I crashed head on into a dump truck. Somehow, I got out with two broken legs, broken clavical lacerated spleen and major pulmonary contusions. 5 months later i was walking around like nothing happened. 
Now, don’t get me wrong. What i did was INSANELY F*cling STUPID. I luckily i was alone and that I hit a dump truck and the driver was untouched. If someone lost a life because of me without a doubt i’d go into my garage close turn the car on… you get the idea. Anyway, what i’m getting at is i’m done with life. I don’t want to be alive anymore. Medication isn’t working anymore and therapy is a joke because i can’t really afford therapy other than what medicaid is offering. 
I feel like such an asshole because other people would take my life in a heartbeat and if i could give it to them i would. My best friends mother passed away. I’ve never known a stronger mother/daughter relationship if i could take her moms place i would. My closest friend from college passed away if i could give him my life i would.

199,How to not be sleepy all the time?,"So I have diagnosed severe depression and I have problems with being productive during work. I can't focus for very long and try to take breaks, but after a certain point in the day I've just used so much energy trying to be productive and get things done that I'm just exhausted and unmotivated. Most of the time I'm just unfocused so I don't get things done when this happens, but sometimes I'm so unfocused and tired/bored of what I'm doing that I end up napping.

Things I've tried:

- Working somewhere else. I work from home, so it's easy to accidentally end up napping. But I've tried going to a coffee shop with my laptop for example, and I still end up super sleepy and unfocused (although it does prevent me from getting in bed).
- Caffeine. I could have a ridiculous amount of caffeine and still be sleepy. I've literally had an energy drink and then taken a nap like an hour later.
- Pomodoro technique or taking breaks. I've tried multiple apps for this. I've tried taking walks instead of just being on my phone during breaks. I've tried the 25/5/25/5 thing and other increments too. Nope.
- Organization methods. I've used kanban boards, all kinds of to do lists, and a bajillion different methods of organizing tasks and trying to be motivated. It works at the beginning of the day, but after a while I'm tired of it and just need to stop for a bit. At the beginning of the day I'm like ""Yeah I'm gonna get these things done!"" but near the middle of the day I'm like ""I've done 3 things and they weren't that hard but I'm so tired.""

I go to sleep around 11:30/12pm and wake up at 8am. I've been doing that for months now. So I do get enough sleep.

I'm on meds. They're working a little but maybe I should try a different prescription. Is drowsiness a side effect of fluoxetine?

I have a morning routine, and I have coffee every morning.

206,I'm terrified of becoming high risk again.,"(TLDR at bottom)

So some backstory I (18F) have been struggling with my mental health for pretty much my entire life. Within the ages of 13-15 things seriously started to take a turn for the worse. At 13 I was put into therapy. I personally don't think it really helped me get better, but I do think it helped keep me stable especially since I was struggling with suicidal thoughts. I very cleverly (not) hid the intensity of these thoughts from my therapist. Another important thing to note is that when I was 14 I dropped out of school to focus on my mental health. I wasn't going uneducated though. I dabbled in some private tutoring and then moved to online school. Online schooling didn't really work for me though, purely because I wasn't motivated enough for it. After my 15th birthday I began to struggle with SH which was rather dangerous. Specifically because once my therapist discovered this they kind of developed the mindset of ""she's getting worse so what's the point in trying to help her anymore?"". Ladies and gentlemen I present you my countries mental health system lol.

Anyways when I was 15 I made a breakthrough. I discovered my passion for horses, and I'm now an equestrian. Horses became my reason to live. They became my life. They showed me that life is worth living. I am not kidding when I say that I am 100% sure I would be dead if I did not discover my love for horses.

In order to persue my love for horses I had to pull myself together slightly. I started leaving the house in order to go to riding lessons which was already a huge step. What made the highest impact on me however was the existence of something that is essentially an equestrian school. They can help you complete your high school certificate and also train you to be able to complete equine certificates, which set you up for jobs in the equine field. I went to this school full time and it seriously turned my life upside down. Being taught with horses each day made education something I was actually motivated to do because I could actually see my future! I wanted to have a future with horses in it! This was huge for me. Especially since before this school I saw no purpose in education. I genuinely planned on dying before I reached my current age. My dream of horses became my reason to live. I cannot overstate that.

Now of course this all sounds well and good. I've technically finished high school, I've got supportive friends, a will to live and I'm finally functioning in society. Sounds fantastic right? Well kind of. My mental health struggles are still there, I've just gotten very good at lying to myself and pretending they aren't there.

Something that scares me is that my therapist let me go. Due to me integrating into society again she saw no more need to keep working with me. 

As I said before I pretend my mental health struggles aren't there. This pretty much sums up my state of being at the moment. I ignore my mental health issues and just try to keep pretending like everything is fine so I can keep myself together. If I'm being honest I only manage to keep this up maybe 90% of the time.

All the problems I ignore bottle up, and come out in that other 10%. It seriously does not take much at all for this 10% to show up. Eventually after a while of me lying to myself and pretending I'm okay, one small thing can come along and blow my entire illusion of stability up. Just like that I'm back to the wreck I was 3 years ago. Just like that I remember that I'm not okay. I'm back to feeling exactly how I felt before horses came along.

Now the title finally comes into it. I've spent so long lying and pretending I'm okay but I:m getting tired of holding myself together. I am TERRIFIED that eventually I'll fall back into being unstable. I'm so scared that I will just get too tired to stay together. I'm scared because I have no therapist anymore. I have no support system if that happens. (Even though therapy in this country isn't even that great anyways)

I don't want to die right now, but I'm so scared that in the future I will get tired of 90% of my life consisting of me lying to myself, ignoring my feelings and desperately trying to hold myself together. I'm scared that in the future, I'll get too tired and I'll give up. I'm scared that I'll become suicidal again, horses or not.

TLDR; I've been pretending I'm okay for ages and have been ignoring my suicidal thoughts. I'm scared that I'll get tired and won't be able to ignore them anymore.



Honestly I'm not expecting any advice for this because I have no clue what advice you'd be able to give me. I mainly just wanted to put my thoughts into words, and I suppose a part of me wants them to be seen.
In the event that you do have any advice though I'd love to see it.

209,I did something very stupid,"A few months ago I felt the urge to leave my office and left all my things there (money, car keys, phone, etc). So I left and started wandering the streets for a whole day. I was just thinking to get lost, kill my self, but I was weak. After finding myself at night walking a lonely road I decided to came back. It was a hard because I couldn’t see the way, it was too dark, and I was fighting with the idea to jump in front of a truck or to keep wandering and never coming back. When I arrived home my family and coworkers where concerned, my feet were “destroyed” and I was dehydrated. 
Till this day nothing have changed, I still feel that I’m on that road. I’m not complete. I’m alone, family and friends just stayed some days after that and then left.
I have an easy life, I just can’t figure out why I’m failing. I don’t want to be here anymore.
I guess coming back was a bad idea.",1681170402.0

I am so depressed though I don't want to hurt myself but if something happened I wouldn't be mad. My dad died a year ago and since then it has been a down hill spiral. I live far away from any family and can't really move right now. I have 3 kids and a husband. My husband is over my depression and tells me I just need to get up and over it. He Says I have no discipline because I can't make myself do things like clean and stay in a routine. He complains about my mess and how I don't stay on top of things and how I'm always tired. I also have a very painful chronic condition too. I've tried to explain how the way he talks to me doesn't help at all but he doesn't care. I'm just so exhausted and have 0 will for anything. Idk how to get out of this rut. I do take meds but they just make me tired but I can't be tired because I get yelled at for it.,1681187214.0

213,writing a thesis while struggling,"I'm in my final month of my undergraduate degree. I've been juggling full time work and education (apprenticeship) along with depression and possibly adhd (finally off the waiting list and should be getting assessed soon). 
But I'm just so burned out and exhausted and with everything else, I spent the past week in bed after calling in sick because I can just barely bring myself to do anything at all. I barely ate the past week aside from quick and easy snacks when I actually felt hungry. Most of the time I didn't feel anything and it was just realising that it's probably been too long between meal. 
Motivating myself to do anything more than the minimum has been a struggle, and I already feel like I have less time than others. Software development so I spent most of the year on my technical project, but all my grades come from my report on the technical project. My supervisor advised me to leave at least a month to write it and that isn't including the presentation I have to do as well. 
It's all just so much. And after everything I've already done the past 4 years and basically having no time for personal life, I'm just dragging myself to the finish line.

214,Losing,"Losing steam

What's the point of being alive if you can't really live.  What do I have to try for, what do I need to be here for.  What purpose is being served by me continuing, trudging along with this dead weight on my back.  I can't enjoy anything when the only thing I'm allowed to feel is uncomfortable and disappointed.  Good feelings don't last long and leave me with withdrawals. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way and other people are suffering with other things that are probably worse which is why I don't complain much and I never say anything unless I really can't take it.

Medication resistant depression that never lets up, loneliness, complete hatred for myself, and unrelenting boredom.  Dear Lord the boredom.  Nothing takes it's away and if it does, it doesn't last long. Which leaves me disappointed, which crushed any good mood I may have achieved.

I'm running out of steam and I don't know how much longer I can't take it.   
I don't have that bad of a life, i have my two sisters and my dad who is getting pretty old. I live with my girlfriend and her kids but honestly between her mental illness and mine, we aren't doing to well in our relationship. 

At this point in crawling on my hands and knees trying to move forward, not being able to see a damn thing around me.  Everything feels the same, bad.  But I can't even remember ever feeling happy so maybe I have a warped expectation.

It’s weird how even emotional damage can manifest into a real pain you can feel. Some days it’s barely noticeable and others it’s genuinely enough to put me on the floor. It’s crushing when it gets to that point. It doesn’t help that I’m always thinking about everything. I hardly sleep at night.

216,"I've (31 f) always neglected my hygiene for hobbies, why?","I'm trying to get an understanding of what this might be. As long as I can remember I haven't been able to keep up my hygiene, because I felt like I didn't have enough time for other things I wanted to do or just lacking motivation to do things like brush my teeth or shower/bathe.

My mom was super controlling, so I didn't start washing myself until I was maybe 9 or 10. By then I already started developing breasts and I remember she was making weird and rude comments while bathing me like, ""I'm not a l*sbian! You need to start washing yourself!"" And she also rarely ever let me take a bath. I was taught to just take sink baths with a wash cloth. 

This sink baths thing continued on into teen and adulthood. I had to be as fast as her, because she said it only took her 15 minutes vs  my 45 minutes. No one can get clean from a sink. I only washed the main areas and put on my clean clothes. I've been caught at least 2 or 3 times over the years with months of dirt on my arms and legs. 

Also yelled at of course for it. I've been called mentally ill. I've been told I'll get locked up forever and that I was doing it to make her look like a bad mom. I'm sorry this is so long, I'm just trying to figure out what's wrong with me. I don't feel depressed, but I guess you don't have to or maybe I'm just ignoring it. I don't sleep all day or lack energy. I thought things would improve once I got away from her and actually started making choices for myself, but since I cut her off, got a job, and a place it is still happening.

There's no motivation to take a shower or even a sink bath either, eat, clean my apartment, do laundry, take the trash, ect. I like listening to music, browsing on TikTok, working, and watching TV. That's about it and if I get bored enough I'll sleep early, but I still wake up early to go to work. How do I stop this?",1681155297.0

I’ve never been wet like that before except a handful of occasions and with only him never any of my exes.

I’m already planning to go to my dr about other things so I guess I’m going to bring it up to her then maybe I can fix myself.

Updates: I had both a depressive episode and anxiety attack in one and wrote out everything I wanted to say to him and how I was feeling and I just sent it. It was late at night so he didn’t respond until morning but he understood everything I had spoken about and he reassured me in that there isn’t anything wrong with me but we just have both been sexually frustrated and haven’t had the time or space to really get into it like we wanted and it came to a head like this since we didn’t really communicate it right away.",1681181054.0

Though now I'm feeling incredibly low and I'm on fluoxetine and it kind of helps but I have a lot of days like today where I just cannot even function because of how low I am. I've though of going back to therapy but I just don't know if it'll help. I know where a lot of my problems lie and I know where some are just things outside of my control and how the world is so I just don't know what more a doctor can do?

I don't want to waste time and money going to see a doctor if I'm going to just be like this forever. Wondering if anyone is in therapy who has similar thoughts and if you find that it helps.

I had a really bad night this past Friday and the husband talked to me but apparently ended up drinking 3 bottles of wine. I was feeling very suicidal and he helped talk to me but it's causing problems. I told them I'm going to give them space and that I'm going to find other avenues to seek late night help to remove my burdens from their shoulders.

228,How to get over being depressed of the younger generation,"Writing this and asking for replies feels so stupid and also frightening. Frightening because I'm sure I'll receive some nasty responses and stupid because a grown man has feelings like these.

I'm almost 48 and feel so unaccomplished. I feel jealous when I see younger people out and about having fun and living life.

I grew up in a household where our parents didn't push us kids, to do well in school. I graduated but didn't go to college. I didn't have a friend growing up.

I enlisted in the Army after graduation in 1995 (I graduated in 94) and thought my life had taken a turn for the best. I made friends, and I felt like I had a purpose. However, while in the military, I was introduced to drugs, and it seems that's when my life turned for the worst.

I didn't get kicked out of the military because of drugs, but I did come out as gay and was discharged honorably. I then moved to Washington, DC, and got a great job in the Federal Government but later lost it because my drug use skyrocketed. After that, I lost three other jobs because of drugs. Drug use encompassed my entire life, it seemed. I didn't start getting clean until the end of 2013.

I got back into the federal government and regained everything that I had lost and then much more, but I've lost so much of my time growing up and enjoying life. And I did. That's precisely what happened.

So now I'm older. I see the younger generation having fun, being successful, and earning more of a salary than I am. I make a 6 figure salary, but that's normal in the DC area.

Why can't I just be thankful for what I have today? Why can't I accept that I'm older, have more ailments, and my looks are changing?

I know all this doesn't sound very smart, but it's important to me. 

Of course, there's more to drug use than I can type in this post, and I have medical issues because of my drug use.

236,Advice for Suicidal Ideation,"Obligatory ""On Mobile, Pardon Formatting""
So since my Early Teens (28 now)  i've always had the rationality that if my life were ever in danger, i wouldn't do anything to stop it. I.e. Armed Robber,  Car Accident, or a Dozen other Ficticious Scenarios.
I am an Organ donor and have standing DNR (Do not ressucitate) preference, so i've always lived knowing that if i did die for whatever reason, my body would serve a purpose. Even if my Organs dont save a life, they could be used for Scientific Research.
Is this Lack of self preservation a form of Suicidal Ideation? I dont actively put myself in dangerous situations with the intent of dying, and i have plenty of things to live for- a Loving Wife and Children for starters.
I'm just concerned that if it ever came down to it, and my life is in danger, and i can do something to save myself- i wouldn't and would just accept my fate.

People always say it's gonna be better or just told me to pray more and get into some decent company to clear my head.

One of those things is that everyone makes mistakes, and they need to try and learn from them, try not to make them again, and forgive themselves. The issue I have is that I can't seem to do that. One mess-up seems to just, bounce around my head incessantly.  


Something that I did recently discover, and I don't know if this applies to anyone else on here, is something on Responsibility OCD. I'm not a professional by any means, and I am looking at maybe speaking to someone about it, but someone with Responsibility OCD tends to obsess over past discussions and arguments while trying to figure out if they did something wrong.  


I also often feel guilty whenever I say something that offends someone. I can say insensitive things unintentionally, and sometimes say them out of frustration, but I struggle with forgiving myself. Which then goes back into the loop.

But nearly every time I have to work in it (I'm a Amazon driver), those are the days that for some reason always make me reflect on my life. I get mad depressed when I keep realizing my life is work sleep, work sleep. These are the days where I really hype myself up inside and say enough is enough. I tell myself I'm finally gonna do this or that, pick up a hobby, pursue a higher education.. But of course that never happens. It's like rainy days really get my thoughts going, but I still don't act on them. Working on rainy days mixed with certain music really hits hard too. There's so much music that I would listen to in my teen years whenever I was feeling down. Most of it had meanings that I could actually relate my life to. Wether it was about not letting hards times get the best of you, or the impact of losing someone for whatever reason. Even if there was a song that didn't really have the meaning that I thought, I still feel so emotional to the tone of the song. Listen to that music today makes me reminisce those hard times in my life, but also keeps me thinking about how much worse it's gotten. Certain music just hits hard when it's raining. Maybe this is all seasonal depression..?

There have been times in life where I have gotten a good deal but I have thrown it all away. Idk what happened but I have a proclivity towards depression and anxiety. I start believing the lies that my brain makes up and I mess it all up.
I threw away a great undergrad uni cause my brain was paranoid about not being able to pass anything. I got obsessed with something silly for 2 years and spent those on my bed. Few years down the line I got an internship at my dream firm and would’ve gotten a full time offer but unfortunately during that time I developed body dysmorphia and started believing the paranoid lies that my brain was feeding me.

I quit eating thinking that I would gain weight etc. I guess I got blacklisted from my dream firm.

244,Switched meds and very depressed 5 weeks later - should I go back to the old one?,"I quit taking Paxil after 10+ years and switched to Auvelity around 5  or 6 weeks ago. I was taking 50mg of Paxil a day and wanted to try to see if something would work better as I was sick of being depressed.  I had no issues weaning off of Paxil and no side affects from Auvelity but didn’t feel better or worse. Around 10 days ago I started feeling very depressed. I’m also having monthly IV ketamine booster shots and even after one of them 8 days ago I didn’t feel any better and went in for another one yesterday and still very depressed.

My question is whether the Paxil was a better drug for me and it just took a month without taking it for it to wear off? I have been hoping there is something better out there but thinking of going back to Paxil.

245,How to deal with regret and feelings of having missed out?,"Ok, so basically I'm a 23 yo guy. Recently graduated uni, and getting my masters now.

For the past 7 years (basically high school and uni) I have done little apart from studying. I had this thing instilled in me that I had to be the best, and my whole sense of self worth was based around it, so, even thought I was interested at all in my subject of study (biotech), I still kept at it.  
I suspect that I have avpd, and so constant studying allowed me to hide from the world. So I missed out on having good interactions with my parents, doing whatever fun things teenagers and uni students do, and basically never learnt how to be a functioning human being, especially in the social department. Also, I have a severe case of scoliosis and flat feet which I neglected due to being preoccupied with studies. But all was well, and I kept telling myself that I'm making those sacrifices to get a good education.

And sure enough, I recently graduated uni with amazing grades. At the time, I also stopped taking antidepressants which I've been taking (different types) on and off for more or less 6 years. This coincided with me meeting some new people as a part of a project I was doing. And these people were not only much more accomplished academically  that I am - they are confident, fully functional human beings happy to go out and have fun. And they are actually interested in their studies - something I never  thought possible as I had always considered studying an unpleasant chore. This realisation made me realise what a farce my whole life had been. I finally feel strong emotions, which is great and all, but the pain it came with is the worst I've felt my whole life. Everything I have ever done feels like a big mistake.  

And another thing that gets me down is that as a part of the project I have interacted with the single best person I've seen. These feelings are probably stupid as I have no experience having romantic thoughts about anyone before. Still, this possible infatuation is also causing me a great deal of distress because I know that due to my ugly face, broken body, lack of life experience, and no prospects make me unworthy of any good people, let alone her.  

Recently I haven't been able to sleep thinking about all the things I had missed out on. It annoys me to no know because before I considered myself a master of showing painful feelings aside. And I don't know how I could translate this newfound energy into something constructive. I had violent tendencies and suicidal thoughts before, but lately they've escalated to levels I have never experienced. I find momentary relief in hitting myself with things, and cutting, but that never solves anything. I've been thinking of going over the edge more and more recently. Don't want to hurt my parents though. God, this shit reads like some emo journal. I'm sorry. I'm really desperately sorry for the little I have and the vast array of things I havent done in my sad excuse for a life.  

Is there a way to stop these thoughts and somehow move on?

TLDR: How to deal with overwhelming feelings of guilt, regret, and having missed out on your entire youth, if these thoughts are making you want to end your life?

252,I'm so tired,"I feel so defeated. I don't know why no-one takes me seriously or why I'm not deemed worthy of help. I'm just stuck dealing with all of this alone because I'm functional enough to work I guess. 

I was bullied from age 5 to 16, had no friends until I was 17 and then lost all of them at the age of 18. I stopped eating for months and lost a lot of weight until my parents forced me to eat. When I was 17 my bf at the time pressured me into sex and left me to cry in my apartment right after. Similar pressuring happened multiple times during our 4 year relationship. I wrote my first goodbye letter at the age of 8 and had obsessive thoughts about suicide for most of my teenage years. I had constantly horrible nightmares to the point that I slept only 2 hours/night when I was 13-16years old. I saw a schoool psychologist once at the age of 16 who told me I wasn't depressed and that they couldn't do anything for me. 

Next time I saw anyone was at the age of 20 when my friends dragged me to see a nurse about my cutting. I was put on schizophrenia medication which made no sense and made me into a zombie for a good year or so. I would see a nurse once a month, but that was it. She talked shit about her other patients so I switched nurses eventually. Next nurse I saw told me that ""your feelings are just normal in your age"" and that I should have gotten over my bullying by then. Next time I saw her was after I overdosed on muscle relaxants, which qualified me to see my nurse two times a month. Her advice was to imagine putting my negative feelings in an imaginary boat in my head and letting them go with the imaginary stream in my head. 

This did not help. 

I did overdose again on muscle relaxants but didn't bother going to hospital this time about it. Spend the next day walking on water and high as fuck, but hey, managed to work so no-one noticed a thing. 

After starting sertraline I've been way better for couple years now, but I'm still surviving at the edge of my breaking point. I don't see friends cause I don't have energy or interest for it. I sleep most of my free time. I shower only when absolutely necessary for my job. I manage to work by putting all the energy have into it. 

I've struggled for 25years of my life and I'm still ""doing too well"" to see a therapist. Meanwhile my friend had a panic attack two years ago and immediately got a therapist. I don't understand why I'm not worth help, but I'm do damn tired of no-one actually helping me.",1681004749.0

254,In Need of Serious Family Help,"Trigger warning 

Hi everyone,

I apologize in advance for the long post, and I’m using a throwaway count so my family won’t find it. I need advice regarding my little brother, who’s 19 years old. I’m his older brother and I’m 27.

When my little brother was born, his dad wanted nothing to do with him and has never been in the picture, and even went so far as to reject him when my mom tried to ask him to be there for my brother. My brother has only ever had my mom when he was growing up - her, and my grandma, who is very toxic and manipulative, and we live at her house and he has always lived here. I moved back home in late 2021 because my ex and I broke up.

Growing up, my brother didn’t go to school because when he was in kindergarten, a student tried to stab him with a pencil and scared him out of going for good. He started online school, but my mom never made him do schoolwork and so he doesn’t have a lot of math/writing skills and collects disability ($500 a month) for his agoraphobia. 

I tried talking to my mom for years about how this wasn’t setting him up for success but she ignored me and did it anyway. Recently, she’s engaged to a man that my brother isn’t close with at all, and honestly doesn’t really like because he treats my mom badly. But, now she’s gone and lives there, and expects my brother to “just get over it” and go live with her. He doesn’t want to. He lives here with me and my grandma, and he finds my grandma overbearing and annoying. 

The one time he started to talk to a girl, she lied to him and slept with other guys which really hurt him. So he has a lot of rejection and abandonment trauma. 

Last week, we tried to talk to my mom about how she never stays the night anymore - because of his lifestyle he pretty much is up at night and sleeps during the day, and she used to be so involved in his life and would play video games with him, always cook for him, and now he is alone and doesn’t really know how to cook. She never taught him to be independent or be there for himself. He’s never learned to drive. 

When he told her how upset he is all the time, she rolled her eyes at how he said he “wants to kill himself every day.” 

I’m so worried about my brother. He likes to be alone in his room. Him and I text a lot but I should be in his room more. But what scares me is how he said he wanted to kill himself, and how he isn’t motivated to/or being demanded to get help. My grandma will keep him stuck at any cost because she doesn’t want to be alone either, and when he’s given an out - he’s not going to listen to me. Just because something feels comfortable doesn’t mean it’s good for you 

He doesn’t really have the social skills to date and has no idea how to make friends and is very, very meek. He has always had an interest in acting but has never studied it nor does he really take care of himself in terms of grooming and appearance. He smokes a lot of weed in his room to cope, but and so he is always stoned/masking everything. 

I’ll do anything for my brother. I told him I’ll always be here for him. But someday…. I would like to date. But I don’t / nor do I think I could do that with an honest heart knowing he’s hurting or scared of being alone. How could I ever move out knowing how my grandma will treat him, especially when her and I are always at odds? I want love, but I want when more for my brother to be okay, and have a good life. I don’t want him to hurt himself. He rarely, rarely talks about his pain but I know it’s there, and I can’t sleep. He is the sweetest most endearing kiddo I’ve ever met, and yet he is in so, so much pain. 

My family will always dismiss these things. I’ll do whatever it takes, but I’m on my own with it. 

Please help me so I can help him.",1681012181.0
255,"Ways to stop feeling guilty for existing, even if it’s temporary?","I tend to act happy and cheerful towards my immediate family but I’ve always been feeling guilty about living. Everytime I think about myself, I always end up thinking that I don’t deserve to live. People treat me kindly even though I’m not good at anything and I’ve done bad things to numerous people in the past. I tend to distract myself from these kind of thoughts by taking as many shifts as I can because work clears my mind off.

Here’s the story: I’m going to meet my relatives that I haven’t seen for years, which means I can’t go to work for awhile and I won’t be able to distract myself. I’ve been avoiding them because I don’t want them to directly ask me about my life but they will surely interrogate me face-to-face about how I’ve been doing. Personal questions such as “How’s school going?” “Did you make any friends?” “What are you going to do when you graduate?” always take a jab on my mental health and makes me feel more guilty but this isn’t something that I can run away from.

I also have horrible social anxiety. Whether I feel mentally stable or not, I always shake and stutter when I deal with people outside my parents. Being interrogated in person will make my anxiety worse and it‘ll be harder for me to pretend that nothing bad’s going on. I don‘t want to destroy the mood of our trip but it’ll be hard to act cheerful when my mental state’s in disarray. Not to mention, one of my relatives is dying  so I don’t want to take the spotlight and come off as insensitive if I ever break down infront of them. What kind of things should I do or think about so I won’t crumble and break down around them? I need to hide my thoughts infront of these people and I don’t want to give anything away by my body language. I want them to think that I’m doing well and nothing has changed since the last time they saw me.

I haven’t gotten the chance to seek help or open up with my issues because my parents have bigger worries than I do.  I don’t want them to treat me differently if they find out about what’s going on inside my head. Please don’t tell me to seek help rn because I’m looking for a quick (temporary) solution.

262,Excess Clutter,"Dear diary, 

We all define the concept of simple living differently. Some of us might define it as living in our homes, apartments, and bedrooms devoid of unnecessary clutter or creature comforts. Others might define simple living as going about life without less tangible things such as social media and apps. Some might go so far as to include living without cell phones in general! Such is my case, which is why yesterday I decided to close my account with my cellular service provider. 

As a millennial, I struggle to remember life without a cell phone. But on a 3-day backwoods hiking trip (where in most cases cellular signal is non-existent), I experienced a unique and long-forgotten happiness and mental clarity.  

For 3 days I was oblivious to all that was happening in the world, most of it bad: local, domestic, and world politics, the economy, and culture wars. Some might call this “living in the moment.” 

On the drive home, I discussed my feelings my with dad. He hypothesized that perhaps cell phones and the related technologies (internet, apps, etc) unintentionally make life more complicated, rather than easier. 

Not one to dive-in head first, I decided to reduce the amount of daily screen time that I spent on my phone. Prior to the hiking trip and following a divorce, I was no longer checking my phone on the regular and I had long given up on social media. So reducing screen time came easy and in no time I experienced a feeling of liberation along with the happiness and clarity that I felt in the backwoods of my beloved Pacific Northwest. 

Phones weigh but a few ounces but in retrospect mine felt like what I would imagine a ball and chain felt like when strapped to your ankle (on in your pocket).  

I wouldn’t say I’m a full-on Alexander Supertramp; I have an iPad which I use only when I have WiFi signal, and I love technology. But I now refuse to be a slave to it. 

As a result, my group of friends has naturally dwindled down to a few select friends (whom I consider family and a positive influence on my mental and physical health) and my family. If either needs to get in touch with me- they know exactly where and how. 

Give it a shot, it feels great!

263,Is there a way to get out of this?,"I’m 19 and recently I read my old diary I wrote when I was 14, and its heartbreaking that it feels like nothing really changed. I was depressed then over my family who doesn’t care much, mean teachers and friends who have better friends. My own mother even told me to die once. At the end of the diary I wrote a suicide note, and then consumed every single pill I could find in the house. Later I learned that it doesn’t really work with over the counter medication.

Either way, ever since then I guess I’ve lived my life thinking “it’ll get better”, and well I’m too scared to cut or hang myself or jump of the window in the small chance I might end up alive and paralyzed. But now I’ve realized that it really doesn’t, if anything it gets worse. I’m so tired of studying and worrying about money, the future, my appearance etc. The things I wanted to buy and do as a kid doesn’t feel the same anymore and I feel like I’ve expired somehow. I really don’t know what to do with the remaining of my life. I feel like some kind of defective human, I think I don’t see the world like most people do. I don’t understand when my friends talk about love or ghosts or things like that.

It hurts to see everyone else being able to converse and form any kind of relationships easily and knowing I just can’t do that. I feel guilty but it hurts to see others successful and happy, while I’m here thinking about how to just end it all. Feeling happy feels so foreign to me that whenever I receive compliments that I once yearned, I can’t help but feel gross and awkward and feel like it’s just not true. All my friends are pretty,successful and confident now and I’m still here rotting on my bed.

Therapy is too expensive and I’ve tried exercising but it only works for awhile. That and I feel like I don’t deserve therapy because I’m still a somewhat functional member of society. I really don’t want to stay like this forever but at the same time I don’t really know what to do.",1680965422.0

271,How do I go back to developing a hard working ethic after so long ?,"Hello, 

I’m (mid 20’s, M) sure you all know how tough depression can be on you. I’m just realizing now for the first time,  how long I’ve been going through this “depressive episode”. Before I’d just tell myself and others, “oh it’s just one of those days, one of those weeks, one of those months” and brush it off as an episode that would come by when I’m having a hard time and go when I’m feeling better. Looking back though, it’s been one long “episode” for over a decade with really bad days and other better ones. Sound familiar? lol. 

I’ve been through some hard times (relatively), in my teenage years and especially recently in the past 3 years. Every time I see myself sort of coming out of this depressed state, life finds its effin way to pull me back and with every pull, I lose my desire to get out, to put in the effort to lift myself up and be better. And it’s just so draining man;it has drained the life out of me. It has ruined my life, it has robbed me of my creativity, of my ability to think critically, clearly, & well; it has made me so emotional and not in a good way and worst of all, it has made me complacent, lethargic & lazy; I feel like I’m just living life on autopilot, going thru the motions of daily life. In so doing it has taken from me any prospects of success and denied me opportunities that have been presented to me. It’s made it so difficult to get through the bachelor’s program I’m in (I’m so close to just dropping out of college).  And I absolutely blame this illness now; I used to blame myself, I used to be disappointed in myself but not anymore. I point my finger at this sorry state of mind. While doing so I also recognize the need to take responsibility for my own life tho, that I can’t spend the rest of it throwing a pity party for myself and so, I’m trying. 

But I’m just so fed up, angry, frustrated and exhausted at this way of being and living; I’ve wanted to change, to put this behind me once I realized how bad my mental state has gotten. But I don’t have family, nor do I have friends I can turn to for support and I can’t afford therapy, I’m barely scraping by. So here I am, on the internet, asking strangers for some help lol. 

The other day I remembered how, growing up, I and those around me (particularly my mentors, teachers and coaches) valued hard work, discipline, creativity and critical thinking and how much I want to have those attributes and live by them again. I just don’t know how to get it back, it’s been over a decade since I practiced all that tbh. 

I would really appreciate if there’s anything you all could point me to, whether it’s advice, resources, books, websites, articles, etc.  whatever that can help me find my way back to being able to work my butt off, think better, take care of myself, break destructive behaviors and finally break out of this depression and take my life back from it. 

Thank you so much for your time. 🙂",1680918280.0
272,I don’t know what I’m feeling,"Looking for some tips on how to human 

I’ve been feeling bad recently, just not myself. No energy to get things done, then I feel guilty for not getting things done - a cycle. I don’t have enough confidence to be passionate about anything, which in turn has been effecting my self-esteem and self-worth. Been feeling like any amount of time someone has to spend interacting with me is a burden on them. I don’t like how words feel/sound coming out of my own mouth, so I find myself talking less. Thinking less too, as my opinions are usually incorrect about things. 

I try to turn it around by being grateful for my health, having a place to live, and general things like that. I’ll have glimpses where I feel good and can envision a path to feeling normal, but they quickly get internally dashed. I feel like I can’t trust my own emotions or thoughts because they are misleading me/are incorrect. This has been causing a cycle of me feeling upset, then me convincing myself that those feelings are wrong, then once those feelings are gone I’m just empty. It leaves me with no feelings at all. Then I feel like I’m missing something that everybody around me has. Everybody around me is beautiful and confident and smart and talented. I just don’t know how they do it! How do they know they are right?! I am exasperated at the fact that I have no beauty/smarts/talent to give back to the world, and everyone around me seems to have an unlimited supply. 

If someone tries to tell me that I am smart, I do have talents, and I do have worth, I honestly just can’t believe them. I feel like they are making things up just to make me feel better, and it’s embarrassing. I know that they are wrong.

I’m conflicted on posting this, because it feels too personal and needy. Honestly just looking for some suggestions on how others deal with things like this. It just feels like I’m slipping through my own fingers sometimes. Now I feel like I need to end by saying, “I’m sorry.”",1680907838.0

I'm just so ready to go, I workout, I'm going to college in sept and that's exciting I guess, I'm just done, so done with people taking advantage of how easily I believe them because I'm autistic, I just want to be heppy, and I do most the things they tell you to do, I workout daily, I eat pretty good, I have a decent routine, but I just don't know where to go from here.

277,I feel numb,"Hello, a week ago I got diagnosed with BPD, GAD and a mild depressive episode. I don't even know what is real and what is not anymore. I feel like my whole life experience is a made-up bullshit, or maybe I just imagined everything that happened to me in the past (as I have lost my memories almost completely). I feel like I am made up from disparate particles of memory, fragments of the past that pass through me as if I am transparent and made of glass. Shattered glass. My whole body feels numb, I look in the mirror and hate myself every single time. I don't even recognize myself in the mirror or in photos, I feel disconnected even from my name, from life in general, from everybody that I talk to. I am just a puppet who wears multiple masks, I never feel connected to anybody, it's all futile and shallow. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't stand being inside my body and living this life. Nothing makes sense, nothing is worth living for, nothing is real anymore. I don't even remember if I ever was any different from who I am now. 
Nobody really wants to understand me, nobody takes me seriously, even though I am officially diagnosed both by a psychiatrist and my psychologist. My dad keeps telling me it's not a big deal, which makes me feel worse. A very close friend became repugnant towards me after I opened up to her. She says I am stupid and I am faking everything just because I want to be like my mom (who is bipolar btw). Deep down I know that this is not true and that I suffer a lot, I feel so much pain all the time... But everything is going downhill. I was already in denial, I struggle with dissociation and derealization a lot. I still don't know how to apply grounding techniques. 
I also struggle with self harm... Every time I think about it, the urge to do it again grows bigger. I don't know how to stop. And how can I be conscious about this and still not be able to stop?? Nothing makes sense in my life anymore.
My psychiatrist told me to call her when I feel like cutting or hurting myself again, but I am too anxious to do that. I feel like what I experience is not serious enough for that. Also, yesterday I already cut myself... and I couldn't call her. I just couldn't.
I just want somebody to talk to... I feel lost. Nothing feels real. 
What if I am faking everything?

279,Feeling depressed after losing a parent,"Recently i've lost a parent and i'm having a hard time continuing my life.

i have gone back to work. I do have moments where i dont think of it and can talk to my coworkers but then i would feel guilty for forgetting for a bit what has happened recently. Other moments i get this feeling of hopelessness and anxious feeling of getting scared i would never feel happy again and everything will go downhill. The feeling gets so strong which makes it hard to live. This feeling comes and goes but i feel alone of dealing with it myself. i have a hard time explaining to my friend how i'm feeling because i make myself believe that they wont understand and i would look too broken and that they will leave me. I fear really badly that the ones i love in my life will leave. I have read how i should try not to give in to the feeling but it's winning most of the time. i dont know what else to do. i do see a therapist every week or 2nd week but i'm starting to feel like its not working and blaming myself for not getting better since i think he's a good therapist. i feel like my friends are hard to reach but maybe its also me who are worrying too much about being too much for them. im not good at asking for help to my friends.

i would say that i'm depressed but maybe i'm looking like i'm doing fine. i only went back to work because i must earn money and in this way, i wouldnt look like i have completely lost myself to others but i'm feeling fucked up in my head because of this death. i dont believe any good things will happen in my life anymore, only bad stuff.

the thing i hate the most, is how bad i am to articulate my feelings because when i sometimes try to, i cant find the word and i get frustrated, feeling stupid and thinking what im feeling, is not valid.

i'm been thinking about trying to write and understand my feelings and also get better at expressing myself to others because i feel very alone

i guess the question is how can this painful feeling not win over me? and how do you express yourself to your friends about your feelings? and when is the time to find alternative method for this like pills?",1680866619.0

I’m not getting stronger at all, and what makes it worse is constantly comparing myself to other kids my age or younger. Sometimes I just want to quit but I know I can’t do that, and it’ll just make me spiral into an even worse depression.

285,I feel worthless to my best friend,"Hi. I’m still relatively new to posting stuff like this, so pardon any grammar mistakes or spacing mistakes I may make.

I’ve known my best friend for almost a year and a half. I think we’re pretty close. 

But I can’t shake the feeling, every time I talk to her, every time I spend time with her, every time I ask to hang out with her: that someone else she’s (probably) better friends with could do much better than I can.

I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), Severe Depressive Disorder, and Social Anxiety, so I feel extremely bad when I make a mistake around her or say the wrong thing. I was socially dead for a while, and am still learning how to communicate properly, so that doesn’t make it any better.

I always stress her out- whether it be my anxiety, my constant apologies, or my double-checks with her to make sure the joke I told (that she enjoyed) didn’t offend her. It’s always the same: “you’re okay, I don’t mind.” But I can’t accept that. I felt wrong. And because I felt wrong, I feel like I’m not good enough for her.

She doesn’t think it, but she is the most funny, understanding, and comforting person I know and probably will ever know and knowing I am actively making one of the most important people in my life feel bad is tearing me up inside.

She’s told me on multiple occasions how much she loves me, and how much I mean to her, but I just don’t know anymore. I don’t deserve her. I don’t deserve that love. And I know that love is there, but I don’t want it, because someone else that she knows could receive it, because they do such a better job at being a friend than I do.

I’m a depressed, socially insecure, and anxious person who can’t even go 2 days without checking in with someone close to me to make sure they don’t hate me because of something I did. I feel like I’m bringing her down. She has an extremely active social life and has many, many more friends than I, so I can’t help but feel worthless compared to them. I just see her so much happier around them than me.

287,I feel useless and don't know what to do next.,"Depression is something I have struggled with, on and off throughout my whole life. I (20F) have always felt this constant feeling of deep sadness, unwantedness, anxiety and being an outcast for as long as I can remember. When I was in primary school I spent almost every single year in hospital due to my medical problems (asthma/eczema) and the days I did go to school, I often got bullied because of my skin problems. I spent a lot of time alone in the hospital from the ages 9 - 13 because my parents couldn't afford to lose time off of work since I have 3 other siblings. Many of those times I was kept alone in my own hospital room and never left until I left the hospital.

As I entered high school the feelings of depression did not dissipate, rather it only increased from there. At age 16 I started to go to therapist and psychologist, but this only caused problems within the family. I did enjoy seeking professional help but my parents were not very supportive. Especially my Dad who would constantly call me slurs and always be confused as to why I couldn't communicate with them instead. This would happen almost after every single session. I stopped going after a year. When I was 17 my parents pulled me out of highschool since I started hanging out with a bad crowd. A lot of horrible things happened to me that year in regards to sexual assault but I do not want to get into that.

I then got hospitalized for a failed attempt at overdosing. My parents were absolutely distraught and were confused because at that age (17/18) I started to keep to myself more and never said anything about how I felt. So I can understand that a call in the middle of the night from the hospital saying their daughter tried to commit, was a shock to them. Things started to change a bit but it didn't last long. So I just stopped caring and kept to myself. Things got better for me aswell mentally as I got into working and hanging out with friends more and the depression seemed like it was fading away. At ages 19 I travelled to a different city on my own and there I met my current boyfriend and friend group. Sadly I did have to come back home due to some family problems.

Fast forward to today. It is only 3 days before my birthday and I haven't felt like this in a while however the feeling isn't new it me. I do get extremely sad around the time of my birthday because for the last 10 years it hasn't been celebrated or just simply been forgotten, other than last year when I spent it with my boyfriend. I think I feel extremely sad because your 21st is meant to be one of your most celebrated or happiest moments of your life? The only people who have remembered are my boyfriend and friends, however I am sad that my family won't be participating this year yet again.  
I just feel extremely useless aswell, since I haven't been able to pick up work since I've gotten back to my hometown. I genuinely want to work again but its like no one is hiring at the moment and I just feel stuck. Im not exactly an extroverted person nor an introverted person but I do not like sitting in the same place for long periods of time and do enjoy working since I can meet more people.

I have contemplated suicide again but I want to be different now, I don't want to go back into old habits so to combat that I try to be social everyday, exercise often, pray and also read or do word games to always keep my mind busy and keep it from wandering. I honestly just wanted advice from others that have been in my position on how to get out of this constant rut? Also need help with work aswell because since being at home hasn't helped with my mental health at all and just want to be away from it all, but working does keep it productive.

I honestly just need help. Thank you all who have read up to the end, it matters more than you think.",1680836335.0

289,Is this depression? Or wtf is up,"So after receiving a talk on the matter and how we can only take so much before eventually we start to break down I've honestly really broken down. I noticed how honestly withdrawn from life I've been. Sure I'll have a good day, where I can have fun but that's only in the moment and it's usually just jokes. I really take no joy in much of my life right now when there really is a lot that I should feel good about. And this last week it's been nothing but feeling awful, hating myself, and genuinely not doing anything but eating and going back to old habits I had when I was genuinely dealing with a serious depression when I was in college. 

But back to my question. Is it depression if I laugh or have a small moment where I feel happy? Or am I just being a bitch and not focusing on that for my whole day? These really are convoluted thoughts, but an example I'll say is I went on a date recently. Pretty good I'll say. We had lots to talk about and the attraction was there, but I felt like on a larger level that I was just being fake, I felt like the real me was just gone and I had to put on a facade, and it's the same with my friends, unless if I'm talking about my genuine emotions.",1680819898.0
290,How do I get help?,"I'm not going to explain how I feel because there are thousands of other posts just like this, and reading them has got me nowhere. Please skip to the final section if you can't be bothered to read this. 

I don't know how to understand what I'm feeling. At times I am consumed by an interminable dread, and at other times (often when I'm distracted by other things) I feel ok. I know that as I write this, tomorrow I will shrug off what I feel. I have had periods of continued depression (2 weeks +) but as soon as it's over I either play down or forget what happened.

I have only admitted this to one close friend, who is convinced that I have depression, but I don't know. Sometimes I am certain I do; sometimes I think I don't.

I have looked for advice but all I find are people who have genuine problems and traumas, and actual worries to complain about. I do have issues which cause what I feel, but I don't want to admit them here. 

I've tried to research depression and found that I have almost every symptom. But I convince myself that I just found what I was looking for. 

Honestly, I could continue writing about this for ages, but nobody wants to read a huge wall of text and I need people to read this.

297,"I've been getting better, but I really don't know where to make new acquaintances. Tips?","For the past two months I've been feeling quite alright, but the thing is that I've been living as a shut in for so long, that I can't relax when speaking with new people. I feel lonely, but I can't relax enough to have a nice conversation with someone, automatic response to a contact with a stranger is to abort and eject immediately, I have to force myself, which is demanding. I think I have social anxiety to some degree, I sometimes start shaking when conversing with someone. 

But I said to myself enough is enough. If I continue this, depression won't ever go away and only I myself can change something. The only way through is to expose myself to these situations, where I feel vulnerable. However, I am at a loss, where does one go exactly to meet new people? I've never done this before. 

Can someone recommend me some activity or place where I could meet new people? Preferably places and activities where I could meet people my age (I am 25 years old). Thank you.",1680777615.0

299,Saw a video online that had lead me to develop extreme anxiety and self harm,"I was unfortunate to be see a video of a woman and an animal intimate together. I only saw a brief second of it, but in those few seconds it has absolutely fucked me up. I was not out purposely seeking said video. It was something that was posted to a sub that was for obvious reasons taken down very quickly. I’m trying to hold it together, but now I have developed anxiety, which has manifested into my right had continuously shaking due to me masking everything else. For the past 15 years I have done self harm on and off. Mostly when things were absolutely out of control in points of my life. The self harm during those time were mostly minor and superficial, though some were very deep. The contents of the video has lead me to start again. Thinking of safe harm and doing the act of it seems to be the only thing that can absolutely take my mind way from what I had saw. I want to desperately forget what was seen, especially since prior to this I did not suffer from anxiety. As of now I know the self harm will get worse, and I have access to benzo’s through friends. I consider myself pretty level headed and have sustained severe child abuse trauma my past. But I have never used any substance to help cope. Having them now and easy accessible is a game changer. And it scares me. I am also some one that can fake very well of being alright on the other side. I know that I absolutely need professional help and will start to make arrangements tomorrow to get seen. I will try my best this to get this expedited. But I am at the will of our health care system. This has completely gutted me. Further more, some of my work duties are animal related. I am deathly afraid of going back to work because I know it was spike my anxiety. I do not want this to effect my professional life, and have my coworkers seeing me struggle or even know what was the cause. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated",1680769476.0

YES!. YES!""  but Terry is pretty nice.

The person I was talking about in this story is a short British boy, and also at school he doesn't stop keep hurling his insults calling me ""fat fuck"", even though i have gained weight, there is a person in this friend group lets call him terry, terry is a bit chubby like me except a lot more, he has never helped me against the British kid, but always he is a companion. Now, the most scariest part is the other friend. He is smart school wise but npc when coming to socializing or doing anything else he smiles at peoples pain ever so slightly, now he has hurt me before because i was ""disrupting"" his learning by tossing my laptop to my desk . Hes not bad just confused, He never explained why he did that. Anyway this ""npc friend:"" lets call him, He doesn't get insulted by this British kid ever. In fact they are probs best friends. Only me and terry, except terry hurts me lightly, i don't want to tell my parents they'll think I'm crazy. And also the npc friend hurls insults at me to, without expressions i might add. except with his mouth open slightly, droopy lip. He is also short like the British kid, now if i might add we are all in 1 friend group   including: 

Me (normal) 

Npc Friend (hurts and confused) 

British kid (Asshole)

307,17 M help with depression,"hey guys i want to know if i have deppression or not. i have these sympthoms:
 1 feeling hopeless and empty.
 2 I feel worthless all the time for eg. when someone tells me ""you are smart"" it makes my day or even week when normal people just dont care about it i dont value myself so when people greet me with something i feel happy but that happens rarely sometimes i dont care about that greets  and i just go whatever i also find it hard to get motivated and i always blame myself i cant remember the last time i greeted myself or not blame myself for a thing. 
3 feeling depressive or sad. When there is something that can distract me like family friends or video games i dont feel sad i laugh with my friends but when these distractions are not there i suddenly feel sad again. And its just some small things maybe im too sensitive? But i cant change it i will give an example when i see a kid i dont care about the good side i always go like that kid will be sad 
and figure out how cruel world is. But thats not like that i know it but i cant change im tired of this pessimist feeling whenever i see happy people.
 4 trouble concentrating or remembering things. I always forget things i read on a book i like to research and read stuff but i just cant keep it in my mind and i mean like %90 of the text
5 Tiredness and lack of energy. I was always a lazy person but i feel like i really lack energy for a long time i always stretch or yawn even though i dont move. I dont want to go out to meet with my friends i sometimes lie to not meet with them even though i like them. I dont want to talk people cause i dont trust my social skills or think that they dont value me they listening me just to listen they dont care about my words.
 I have social anxiety and it makes my life hell its like a force stopping me from doing certain actions even though its all in my mind 
I might not have depression due to lack of self awareness actually i dont even know if i lack self awareness or not cause i always think im inferior than other people.
I dont get pleasure from things i mostly stay silent in conversations cause i sometimes find it pointless (not because we're all gonna die) like gossipping and it really hurts connections between friends or just dont improve at all and humans are social individuals thats what made us survive strong social connections.
I cant really remember when it all started cause i wasnt aware of it.( I would say about 1 year ago but not precisely)
Im also a very sensitive person so my mood can easily change 
I also dont have conversations with my parents If i have depression i dont know how to tell my parents about it cause im sure they think im not sad 
And i dont think i can make those sentences while talking to a psychiatrist maybe its just a teen thing that will pass?
So if i have depression should i go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist? i dont really want therapy i know what to do but i just cant make it (im not very knowledgable on therapy please dont get me wrong)

Humiliation of being pulled out of work by the police, restrained in front of some co workers was by far a reality. I don’t want to hurt myself, but I don’t want to hurt or be sad. I want to go back to my normal happy life. More counselors, find a new job, get life on track. The walks don’t help, can’t write my feelings out because there is proof of my hurt.

You understand? How when you didn't go though what I went though. ""NO but it's like similar"" yes and? You telling me if someone who witnessed murder and someone who killed someone have the same exact trauma? It's different if they both just did it they both still cry abt it.

323,Does anyone else struggle with accepting the need for multiple medications?,"I'm one of (the apparently) many that have symptoms of overlapping ""problems."" In my case the very classic triad of features of depression, anxiety, and ADHD.

A large part of the trial and error process for me has been discovering that any one medication can only *help* with part of the picture:

\- Stimulants are amazing for focus but for whatever reason tend to make me more depressed (I think the up-down cycle just exacerbates the depression that's already there so they're both not helping with depression and making the problem more apparent at the same time).

\- SSRIs pretty much eliminate depression and anxiety but do nothing for focus. In fact, because I find them sedating they tend to make things like task initiation and executive dysfunction worse.

Because it seems like any one med can only help part of the picture, I've resorted, in the past, to self-medicating (my chosen combination as ridiculous as this might sound: an SSRI plus caffeine to help with all the ADHD stuff).

I've realised that so much of my opposition to accepting the idea of any kind of combination of medications is that I tend to buy into all in one thinking *big time*.

My fault inner logic goes something like this: ""if I'm going to commit to taking medication, I want one pill that at least helps with *everything* and I don't want to be on some kind of drug *regiment*.""

Where my own logic falls down (I just need to internalise this): caffeine is a drug too, just not one that requires a prescription to obtain and ingest!

About a month ago my gf who I’d dated for 5 years and had been my best friend for 8 years decided that we should break up. I thought everything was going well, we were talking about what our future was going to be like. We were about to go to the same college for grad school and everything was going to plan. We even talked about getting engaged at some point in the near future. I was trying to get her parents to go on our family vacation so that I could ask her to marry me. Then out of nowhere, she decided she wants to move on. Doesn’t want to see me or talk to me ever again. Removed me and my family, friends, etc, from all social media. Never had any clearance as to what made her break up with me either. That was my breaking point. I don’t know what to do anymore. Everything I did revolved around her. I’ve been seeing a therapist but honestly nothing seems to help. All people say is to move on but to me it’s not that simple. She was my everything, she knew everything about me. Things I don’t even tell my family. She was always there for me. I just don’t know what to do anymore",1680579855.0
325,Dealing with Anxiety and Intrusive Thoughts," 

Today, I'm a really difficult day dealing with anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I felt overwhelmed and hopeless, and I didn't know how to cope. Don't get me wrong please, I do not plan on doing anything stupid because I have much to live for, I think I just wanted to share my feelings with someone, because I feel the people around wouldn't understand me.

Now, I did not feel anxious or anything like that, but I was at the gym, doing some cardio and I started to have really negative feelings. I went out of the gym and I continued to have them. The last time this happened to me, was 4 years ago when my anxiety was at it's peak. Thoughts of being worthless, depression and suicidal and I hate myself for having them.

I guess what I wanted to share my feelings and I wanted to ask to those who suffer from anxiety, if once in a while this is something you also feel, and how do you cope with them. Thank you for reading this.",1680611163.0

I feel disgusting. No matter how many compliments I get, or how hard I try to look good, I feel gross. People have genuinely complemented me on how handsome I look, strangers even, but I can't help not believing them. I see a pretty girl and I automatically feel like a pig. I feel unwanted. I feel like I'm worth nothing more then trash. 

Eveytime I actually start liking somebody(dating for a little while) and I want to make the next step something always gets in the way where the individual has to focus on themselves. I'm not pinning the blame on them, maybe they wanted out, some of them had to flat out move away. But I can't help that I'm the problem. That no one put there wants anything to do with me on a romantic level.
I've been feeling this worthless since high-school. It's never gotten this bad to the point of putting a gun up against my head and wanting to end all of it.

334,I think I have depression with psychotic features,"I have a diagnosis of severe clinical depression with recurrent episodes but recently I read about psychotic depression and felt like it fit me better. I have had a history of hallucinations as well as paranoia. Most hallucinations r triggered when I’m sleep deprived and stressed. 

Some examples are: 

seeing a beetle crawl on my hand when there wasnt anything. 

seeing a tall black hooded figure standing behind me in the microwave reflection. 

seeing a screen lit up but it wasn’t turned on. 

hearing my name being called repeatedly once in Target. While following the voice I literally even replied to it twice saying “YES??”. 

hearing a shrill scream twice in a bathroom stall and looked behind to see who screamed yet the whole bathroom was empty. 

seeing this tall horrific figure hanging from the ceiling when I was awake till 5am (I completely froze and screamed) 

hallucinating a shadowy figure kid standing next to my closet.

broke down crying because I was too afraid to enter my kitchen at night since I kept on feeling like my life was endangered by a demon. (This was a paranoia episode)

in the same vein, it is extends to the way i identify with myself. does my low self esteem cause me to identify as non-binary? or, does the fact that i don’t fit the person i want to be in real life cause me to have low self esteem

She then discarded me by ghosting me and laughing at me and my emotions. I would like to have your interpretations of the fact to hopefully find some peace and closure in all this. Thank you very much**

We met online in 2021, and both appreciated sharing intimacy and profound conversations. We also found each other attractive, through photos and videos we would send to each other.

At some point, she tells me ‘this is a mandala’, as in, something temporal for she wasn’t looking for a long term relationship. Despite of this, she often complaint about people only wanting sex and not long term relationships. She was confused, I didn’t want to force anything, so we gave each other some space.

In early 2021, I proposed to meet up and she ignored me for a week and she said it was best to wait until things calmed down. She had told me previously how she often cancelled last minute or never met people she met online face to face, so I took it as soft goodbye and, given my emotional state - struggling with depression and anxiety - I asked her to block me as I way to guarantee some distance. I was unstable, even though she didn’t know what I was going through and looked very serene (high-functioning depression) from the outside.

In mid 2021 I sent her an email telling her how things were going for me (really bad) and telling her that I was sad that our relationship had come to an end. She never replied. In late 2020, I sent her another one and she did engage slowly.

She then tells me she is back with his ex, with whom she was talking when she was talking to me and she also told me she was going through a phase of ‘fucking randoms’ also when we were talking; even though she said she was only talking to me. Because she was back with her ex, even though he allowed her to explore with girls, and I have had traumatic experiences of this type before (I lost my virginity with a married man 20 years older than me, with whom I stayed for 4 years), I told her I didn’t want to get involved in a sexual or romantic way as it was time for me to learn from my experiences and I was wounded enough.

We met face to face in early 2022. When she saw me she wouldn’t stop saying how beautiful I was, looking astonished, to the point I asked her to cut if off as I was feeling uncomfortable. I've always felt threatened when someone displays interest in me. She came to my place that night, and kept making comments about my looks. Talking about relationships, I told her that I was really slow to grasp when someone was into me, to what she said ‘Yes, I can tell’. Prior to that she said she was sad we didn’t meet face to face in 2021, when she was single because she would have dated me.

I ignored all this, even though I really liked her as I didn’t want to get hurt and was happy enjoying spending time together. We made the habit spending weekends together, she would come on a Friday and leave on Saturday night, or on a Saturday and leave on a Sunday.

One of these nights, she started caressing my legs and I stupidly took her by the hand, to bed. We ended up making out. The sexual tension was really high and I was uncomfortable so I asked her to slow down. She never let me kissed her properly, with tongue, and this really felt like something was wrong.

Clearly a lot of things were wrong...

The next day, she saw me standing there and she came to give little kisses in the mouth. Smiling, and looking at me in a very charming, sweet way. She took my phone and booked the next available weekend in my calendar.

She would message me and I would open her WA messaged hours later after work, and she would call me straight away as soon as she saw I was messaging her.

We would go to public places, and she would hold my hand in the cafe (despite of struggling coming out as a bisexual girl) and caress my skin under my top. The moment we would have to say goodbye, she would ask me to get my calendar out to book the next one and give me a really long, beautiful hug.

Then, in our last encounter, she tells me she knows she has to break up with her ex and also that she has been talking (all this time, for at least a year, if not more) to a guy who is coming to our city. She said they were 100% compatible, laughing nervously and really excited about it. Then she said she didn’t want to get involved with him, but her body language told otherwise.

I went home feeling really hurt and confused, to gather my thoughts and feeling I didn’t message her. I just replied, quite ‘to the point’. Then 24 hours later she tells me she has applied for a job in a different country and she is moving in 3 days. First she tells me it’s a 3 month job, then 6 months. Of course, my thoughts and emotions went wild.

I realise that maybe, this wasn’t ‘it‘ for her and I asked her 'if all of this is just a distraction or a game for you, I think we should go separate ways', to what she said, 'you want to through this away, be my guest'. She then sent me a voice message where she said I only brought chaos to her life because I stayed those two days silent and quite distant as I was processing everything. She said it was my fault if I felt as she misled me and also that she was not monogamous and not interested in becoming romantically traditionally involved with someone. I said to her not only her actions explained otherwise (wanting to commit to his boyfriend long-term) but also that she never mentioned to me she wasn't monogamous. She recognised it was true.

Then I continued to message her to ask her questions to make sure I wasn't assuming stuff that wasn't real and making sure she felt compassion and love from me because that's all I've ever had for her. She then stopped responding and sent me a voice message pretty much laughing at my pain and blaming it all on me. Then proceeded to ignore me/ghost me.

A few months later I learnt she had broken up with her next, never moved and ended up dating the other guy. All my so called delusions ended up being right. All but that she felt enough to give us a try.

She knew I was going through the worst period of my life alone. I've been living in a country different to my own for 7 years, I pay half of my mother's rent and my father was threatening me with using the law against me so I would help him financially as well. I would wake up and start crying randomly. She left me behind in a very traumatic way when I needed her the most. She could have at least answered my questions to give me some sense of closure or at least don't hurt me even more.

Despite of this I never failed to be loving and compassionate towards her.

Clearly a part of her wanted commitment, hence why she came back with her boyfriend even though she clearly didn’t want to be with him (she later broke up with him), but she says to me she doesn’t want to become romantically involved with anyone in a traditional sense, that she is able to feel different things for different people and that I created fairy tales about us. She told me I was delusional just because I thought, since we liked each other in every way, we could at least try.

Did she just want to spend time with me because it was nice? Was she never in love with me? Or she simply was a player?

I’d like to understand this so I can move on. My mental health is only getting worse, with suicidal days every day. I wake up and I start crying randomly thinking of how alone I am, how my parents will never be there for me and other things.

People who suffer from depression come from all walks of life. A lot come from really bad situations they've been put in for one reason or another. My suffering,  however, is entirely my fault.

I live alone because I didn't make the effort to find someone to live with. I live in a city I want to move out of because I haven't made the effort to find somewhere else to live and work. My previous job was killing me, so I quit but haven't made the effort to find a new one (I have enough money to live off, for a bit). I'm fat because I eat like shit and don't exercise. And that's given me mild illnesses like haemorrhoids. I haven't got any close friends because I haven't put in the effort to make any friends at all in the place I live, and the ones I have who live elsewhere have drifted away due to me not putting in enough effort to maintain them. I want to date but I'm too ashamed of my body and the state of my apartment and life to do so. I've been wanting to go away on holiday for 3 years, and leaving my job was intended to let me do that, but I haven't put the effort into actually doing it, nor nurturing a relationship with the relative I might be able to stay overseas with. I have money I need to invest but haven't done so. I have correspondence I need to keep up with which I don't do. I have had the opportunity to do something with my life for the last 3 years but have done nothing. I'm even too lazy to end it all. In sum, I am the closest to a waste of space any human can possibly get.

I'd ask if there's anyone with even similar-ish experiences to me, but I honestly think I might be the lamest, laziest, person with the most self-inflicted problems on the planet.

347,I (30F) can't move on and fear I will end up dead or in a psychiatric hospital,"I’m going through the most painful and hardest period of my life, alone.

I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for over 3 years now. I’ve been given antidepressants given how constant and intense my emotional breakdowns are.

The cause being relationships ending and ending in very traumatic ways, in a time where my grandad died, I broke up with my alcoholic and abusive ex and found someone who I clicked with incredibly, and who basically put me on hold and then discarded me in very traumatic ways despite of knowing that I was alone and suicidal.

It’s hard to explain the pain that I feel inside, and how these experiences have completely changed my beliefs and hopes about life and the future.

I wake up and automatically start crying thinking of my ex or how alone I am, or how hurt my mother is and how much pain my little niece is enduring as he is divorcing. How my parents will try to get money out of me until the end of their lives and how hard it’s for me to find love given my fearful avoidant tendencies. Especially avoidant at present.

But it’s mostly about her. This story has been on and off for three years. There were red flags everywhere and I still decided to get intimate with her. I fell in love and then she discarded me after making it clear that she didn’t want to be in a relationship with me, blaming on me something that I never did. Even thought she did play me, lied to me and used me.

Now I find myself compulsively stalking her on social media and seeing how she has moved on and is with the guy she told me she didn’t like. Travelling and living her best life while I’m here, wanting to die everyday and hoping she will message me to help me get some closure.

I can’t stop. I’ve deleted my Instagram. I’ve gone out of social media. And nothing.

My brain understands the situation and correctly realises that this story will be irrelevant and has ended up for the best. But my heart and emotions are all over the place, and can’t align with that logical realisation. In fact, the impact of all this is so big, that I had symptoms of a stroke and I struggle to go up the stairs without needing to stop to breathe. And I’m a sportive girl.

I’ve spent 3k in therapy, read every book, listen to every podcast, etc. and nothing. No one can provide a logical path for me to get over this, or a way for me to release emotions and move on.

Every day is an emotional breakdown and all that makes me feel better is that I will die at some point.

I fear one day I will just kill myself.

348,My therapist canceled me.,"to be upfront, She said (in an email) she was having health issues and wouldn't be available for ""at LEAST"" six months. It's possible this is real, but my feeling is like 80% it's just a cover for just not wanting to deal with me. 

The last session we had I was angry and emotional and defensive. I made the comment ""how would you like it if you were walking down the street and someone (made comments to you)"" 

A few weeks before she asked what I ""wanted out of therapy"" or something. I was confused by the question. 

I just feel like if she really did have some medical issue she could have mentioned this in session. But she cancels our last session a week ago because she's sick and then today is just like yeah six months AT LEAST.

I guess I'm just having difficulty thinking up some illness she could have where she wouldn't tell me in session ""hey, just to let you know this has to be our last session for a while, I am going to be receiving treatment...."" and then to cancel a week and then cancel everything. I don't know, like, cancer? I don't think so. She also seems pretty young and healthy, I know that doesn't mean anything. But what could it possibly be other than passing on me.

I feel like it goes a bit beyond just this current place, but I do hate it. They recently forced us back into the office after working remotely for about three years which now cost me and my family more gas money, car maintenance, and child care. The mere thought of being in a place like this for 8 hours and being forced to sit and focus makes me feel awful. I have no care about anything I do for those hours as my passions are definitely elsewhere and I feel I’m losing my mind.

I am also staying very tired, which the second job didn’t help much with but I definitely felt all if this before that. This all has also helped cause me to be more angry a lot of the time and end up not even being a good as I should be to my wife and kid.

i have major depressive disorder with anxious distress and social anxiety disorder. this means going outside (having to mingle with people/shopping/going to the mall/working out at the gym) isn’t really easy for me as well.

354,Does anyone know how I can heal myself from narcissistic abuse?,"So, I admit I'm no stranger to depression. Throughout most of my adult life especially, I have struggled with depressive episodes, mostly because I've not been treated very well by people. 

However, the emptiness and sadness has never been as bad as right now, after having dumped a narcissist and realizing just how messed up it was how they treated me. I found out about a lot of their sneaky behaviour and them smearing my name behind my back, even from the very beginning. There just seemed to be no end to the damage they were willing to cause just to get under my skin and make me feel miserable. 

The real sad thing is that I actually loved this person, maybe I wasn't in love with the real them, as they put on a mask and it was all very confusing, but I loved them platonically and genuinely tried to help them and they thanked me by humiliating me and spreading vicious lies. I'd love to see them find someone new who would put up with as much of their shit as I have.

Anyway, I need to heal, but I'm unsure how. I'm lucky to just have days where I feel okay and not feel either empty or like crying or just angry at this person for the audacity they have to hurt people like this and then act as if they are the victim with their fake-drama. The injustice of it all is awful. 

Can anyone who has been through this themselves help me or give tips? I just want to move on and forget. Sometimes I'd actually like someone to zap my brain of any memory of this individual.",1680510909.0
355,Depressed parent,"Seriously depressed parent

I’m a teen who living with an extremely depressed parent, my mom. She’s been depressed since I was born and has gotten much worse in the past year. It takes its toll on everyone. My dad works and prepares food and does chores all day because she refuses to do them, instead choosing to lay in bed and watch tv all day. She takes horrible care of her self. Our house is a mess with boxes of her possessions and she refuses to clean and organize them. as a result we never invite people over. She refuses to tell us anything me or my brother do wrong, instead crying and yelling at my dad about us, so he angrily yells at us about it. She has multiple times said she’s sees no hope or has given up on life and one night talked about how she thought about hanging herself or jumping off a building. I see a therapist and we both believe there’s correlation between my extremely severe ocd and self esteem issues and my family situation. She actively ruins our lives as we all struggle to work around her in our daily lives, afraid she’ll get upset and ruin our days, which recently seems to happen every other day. I constantly fight feelings of anger and hatred for her and how she is ruining our lives, but also pity her and just want to see her do something with herself. I want her to improve herself so our I can have a good rest of high school, but I’m so consumed by her depression and victimizing of herself that I fear I’ll never have a functioning family.",1680494082.0

357,Have no reason to be here. Need advice on bringing any sort of meaning into my life?,"I have multiple mental health issues, neurodivergence, plus chronic pain. I'm not able to work, so benefits are my source of income. I live alone, though not in the most stable circumstances.  
I'm isolated and have very little to fill my time. The only thing I seem to be here for is drinking and getting high.

I text a few family members sometimes, two of which only care to contact me when they want something from me, and I only see one in person semi regularly. I technically have one friend from high school, but never see her. The few people I know online don't really message me all that much either.  
I'm not all that comfortable socialising and only leave my apartment when I have to as I dislike going outside.

It's difficult to care for myself or my space. Living in disarray makes me worse, so I'm trying to fix that (albeit slowly).  
Alcohol has caused a little bit of weight gain, but apparently that's all it took to bring my eating disorder back... So now I have that to deal with too. Exercising is also unnecessarily difficult due to my chronic pain.

&#x200B;

Some of the issues I have with trying to add meaning to my life are:

All the things ""wrong with me"" generally presenting additional challenges.  
My dislike / discomfort with being around people or going outside.  
Limited disposable income, adding another layer of inaccessibility to many things.

&#x200B;

Obviously isn't a life worth living. I kind of decided a while ago that I would just leave if I can't find a way to change things or make it worth living... I just am obviously struggling with going about that. I haven't managed to yet, clearly... Or I wouldn't be here making posts like this. I know some would consider it unfair to do that to the few people around me, but I'd argue it's far more unfair for me to have to live through this.

Any advice or help you have to offer will be appreciated, even if your suggestion wouldn't work for me. Someone taking time out of their day to try means something. I'm stuck waiting for professional help at the moment.",1680478726.0

359,I'm tired,"

 I rant in this post alot sry in advance 

Idk where to post this so I decided to post it here. I fucking hate my life. I just can't anymore I only have one friend whom I trust but my parents forced us to stop talking so we are distant now, I've got no other friends to share my feelings with so I just store them so they compound. All close ppl do around me is criticize me either in the way I act or the way I talk or the way I dress. 

My relationship with my family is even worse I mean they took the only person I trusted and cared for enough they forced them out of my life bcz ""they know what's good for me"" and so they left me with their shit parenting. I tried talking things out but they never fucking listen and I even asked them last year if I can go to therapy bcz I had suspected I have ADHD (still think I have it) my mom flat out said no she gave me a whole lecture on how she did the tests and shit when I was younger and agreed she'd take me to therapy but whenever I asked she'd gaslight me into thinking I was wrong and she was right.

The only and I mean only thing I look forward to is marriage since I love kids and would love to give them a better life and be a better parent than my parents. And to fucking feel loved I wanna be able to fuck up sometimes and not get criticized or reviece a lecture I want someone to finally have my fucking back. I just want someone who can understand me and care for me and make life worth living.

Its spring now so I wanted to go outside more but I can't really hang out with any of my friends cause they need money to get where I wanna go. So I'm alone and being inside and alone all the time makes me miserable and also reminds me thst  every time I'm daydreaming is just another day wasted but there's nothing I can do to stop it. I could go on a bike ride but I feel awful the entire time due to my seat hurting and I feel dumb with an ill fitting helmet.

No matter how much I try to avoid social media because I know that's a big part of it, I still comparing myself to people my age in shows and moves as stupid as it may sound, and other people I know in real life. My two best friends in real life one is my age and the other is 3 years younger got jobs, but I don't. I'm going to college and they aren't, but still I just don't feel like I'm doing anything productive just doing college work. I want a job, but I don't want to both go to college and have a job I know thats what most people at my college do and that's also a part of my comparing myself to others, but I don't think I would be able to handle it especially because semester just went from 16 week terms to two 8 week terms. I took A&P last term and that was mentally hard on me, so I'm still kinda down from that. Some stuff also happened last term and I started questioning if I really wanted to do what i was going to college for (nursing). I get really annoyed with my parents alot and I think I might have anger issues. I was trying to set me up with a therapist, but none of the people I called will call me back. I honestly just feel numb I'm so over life right now. Sometimes I think about killing myself, but I don't because I think of the pain I would cause my family if I do. Everyone I know also has a boyfriend or girlfriend, and as stupid as it might seem, I'm jealous. I feel bad complaining about my problems sometimes because I know other people have it worst than me. I have both of my parents even they annoy me sometimes and nothing bad happened to me during childhood well one thing, but it's not abuse or anything like that. I don't have alot of friends and no matter how much I try it's just hard for me to make friends. My family tells me I just need to put myself out there more, but I don't think they really understand  how hard that is for me. I wish people would come up and talk to me first that's my only problem, after they say hi to me I'm on board, but people rarely talk to me first. I was homeschooling from 6th grade till I started  college, so I assume that's were my social problems come from. I just don't have the motivation to do school work or anything, but I make myself because I know I'll dig myself a deeper hole if I don't. I do what I feel is the bare minimum at school and somehow get good grades, so the pressure from some of my family and my parents to do good in school is heavy too.

.                
.                
.             
Just like the title says. How?          
How are you supposed to deal with depression?            
I've technically been depressed my entire life, never felt happy, or satisfied, or... good, really. But then early last year, someone came into my life, and she changed it completely. And I was happy. Hell, I was ecstatic.          
For the first time ever, I was getting through every day because I wanted to, I was thriving, and i wasn't just getting through the days because I just felt that I had to.             
But me being, well... me. I screwed up. She began to slowly pull away, she was constantly busy. Even going on to neglect her physical and mental health. And it worried me, so I reached out more to make sure she was alright.          
And she always responded, she put everything aside to talk to me every single time because she knew I get severe anxiety if I'm left alone. But the thing was, I actually got anxiety because of her. Like I said, she stopped eating, stopped showering, stopped sleeping. All to make sure she didn't fall behind on school.         
But she still dropped everything to make sure I was OK. And I never managed to tell her that the only reason I got worried, and anxious was because of her...            
And when she did this, she fell behind, so she neglected herself more, so I worried more. And even when I didn't say anything, she somehow knew. So she still dropped everything to make sure I was OK.          
And I always tried to do the same. But we just both kept getting worse. And yes, it was because of each other, but I didn't care.          
I just wanted her happy. She was my best friend. She even introduced me to all her friends, and her sister. Hell, she even introduced me to her girlfriend/significant other (nonbinary, although I believe biologically female. Idk, I never asked because I don't judge)           
But it was obvious that the way we were doing things... it just wasn't working out.           
Then on the 8th of February, she confronted me. Well... her sister did. Told me the way our friendship was going wasn't working. My friend was there too, and I could tell she was upset about it. She didn't even want to talk about it. But her sister forced her too.        
She told me that she was barely able to go through each day without worrying about me mentally breaking down (which was definitely exaggerated... although I do have pretty bad panic attacks) and that, on top of her 5-8 hours of homework, it was too much.         
So I offered to end the friendship right then and there. And no matter what, I would have been able to remember her as someone I loved, and as someone who loved me.  (I would like to clarify that it was platonic love)        
And even if that would have been the end, I would have accepted it and moved on. But she said no. She refused, told me it would be fine. Said she was keeping the promise she made to me that our friendship would be forever.  And I believed her. That promise was promoted by me making a similar one, telling her that as long as I can still breath, I would always be her friend. Sounds weird, but her father left when she was young, and it completely f'd her up.        
So we compromised. As long as I didn't text her on the weekdays when she was busiest, she would check in on me over weekends to lmk she was OK.       
Well, fast forward to Monday, February 12th, I hadn't texted her, and she never checked in. So I sent her a text asking if she was OK. Technically breaking my side of the agreement, but so had she, so I was worried.       
An hour later, no response, so I texted again. 30 minutes later, still nothing. So I texted her partner. Still nothing. By then I had heard from a mutual friend that she was fine. So my anxiety went away.      
I just thought that she was taking the break seriously. And that was perfectly fine with me. She had finally learned to stand up for what she needed, and I was happy for her. She had learned to put herself first for the first time since her father left.       
But then, later that day, I get called up to the schools front office. She filed what was basically a restraining order. Claiming that I had broken the agreement between us.       
She texted me later that day to clarify.        
Saying that as soon as I got help, we could try again as friends. But as we were, it was a broken friendship.         
And she was right, it was. But she broke my heart. That wasn't just her choice to make, telling me that I had to get professional help if I wanted to have friendships. And because my only friends were also her friends, and with the ""restraining order"" Saying absolutely no mutual contact, I lost all of them too. I can't exactly blame them, they've known her for many years, and they only knew me for one. But I still lost everyone. My entire support system.           
And I don't know if I can go on any more. Even if we do fix things, i don't know if I can trust her. Yes, she was willing to (mentally) hurt herself for me by always putting me first. But then she lied to me. And idk what to think anymore.        
I trusted her with my life, she was my better half, my best friend, the embodiment of every bit of good I saw in humanity, the reason my sun shined just a little bit brighter every day. Yes, we had issues, not just with each other, but I would have given everything for that friendship. But then she left, she didn't just bring the extra light she gave me with her, but she put my sun out completely.           
I know people say ""it's better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all"", but I just don't think that's true. The hurt of the loss is the worst pain I have ever felt, and it gets worse by the day.         
And I listened to her, I got real help. Even started therapy. But it wasn't enough. My body literally tried to give up. It started rejecting all food, and I nearly starved to death. I've lost 40 lbs even after going to the hospital for it. I spoke to several therapists at the hospital, and I was told numerous times that the only way I can get better is to talk to my friend. And to fix things.         
But I can't. And even if I could, I don't know If I... well, could. She lied, and he'll, maybe she had a reason. Maybe I really don't deserve friends. Maybe I don't deserve to get better. Maybe I should just continue to let myself get worse until my body eventually decides to just give up. But I don't know.     
Maybe she does care, maybe she actually thought this would help me. Or maybe she just changed, and she isn't the person that I loved anymore. And that scares me. She always hated her father for leaving her, it messed her up so extremely much, even many years later she's so messed up. But maybe... maybe she's turned into that person.        
And again, maybe not. Maybe she hasn't changed, but she just did what she thought was best. But even if that's true, how can I trust her if she's willing to cut me off so easily? How can I open up to someone like that? How can I be myself?(an extremely open, honest person) I just don't know.        
And it hurts. If pain makes me a believer, I'm in a fucking cult by now. And to hear that I can't get better without her? I don't know if I can live like this...         
I went my entire life alone, never knowing what true happiness felt like... what love felt like. And when I finally did, it was taken from me.

No one actually cares about me and I know it, I see everyone having they're own inside jokes, always texting each other always talking to girls, I'm kind of repeating myself but I don't really know what to say. Everyday I can only sit at home playing games and playing guitar.

Been here two weeks and back at the other house for the weekend with the friend my ex disapproved of as a bad influence suddenly allowed to slee over.  

I have a new family. A wife of five years and a son of 3. The boy is a marvel, one of the most consciously caring people I’ve ever met and I don’t mean that lightly. I can’t keep up. I can’t
Match that level of love to serve as a consistent example for him growing up.  I’ll only ruin him.  

My wife was postpartum and is bipolar and is depressed 90%of the time, and has beeen for 3 years, popping Pills to sleep the days (weekends included) away. It’s down to me to look after our son 75-80% of the time and I struggle. I do not find in natural being a parent after growing up in an abusive household. 

I’m in a country that’s not my own with no family or friends. My wife can’t stand to touch me because of her depression so intimacy is off the table. And she doesn’t have anything inside to give me emotionally because she is so self involved in her own depression. And I understand that. You can’t give what you don’t have. As she says, “I’m dead inside. I have nothing give you.” She can’t even give me a heartfelt hug. It didn’t use to be like this but I have become the maid, the one who does all the chores, the cooking, I put our boy to bed every night which takes a good two hours and then I’m finished.  I used to go to gym every day but there is no time for that anymore I habeen in a year 

I can’t live in a supposed family that should be fillled with love and feel nothing but loneliness and disdain.  If I’m not dealing with the younger one I’m on my own as my Wife is high or stoned or benzoed all the time so there is never a chance to talk to her one on one. 

Please, someone. There must be something you can take to just stop it all. I want to go to sleep and not wake up as I can take this anymore. And before anyone says really talk to my wife I tried and she called it a Pissing contest, that I’m trying to show my Depression is worse that hers. If it wasn’t for the Three year old
I would have walked a year and a half ago.

There must be something. Just to close my eyes and that’s it.",1680380607.0
373,How do i get over someone?,"I know this sounds incredibly rudimentary, but i really dont know what to do with myself.

Basically, i (19f) was talking to a guy(19m), and we werent dating, but we said i love you, we would sleep on the phone every night, we had tons of common interests, we would talk all day, whether it be texting or phone calls, we did sexual things, he called me beautiful and everything like that. He said he wanted to kiss me every time i showed him my face, and things like that. I told him i was demisexual, and he said at one point he thought he was, too. 

He’s just said he’s going to be very busy from now on and wont have much time to speak to me, and called me a friend in the process. 

I feel so heartbroken and upset, i have no idea how to get over this. Ive only ever had one other “crush”, who i ended up dating, and about a month after we broke up i felt better, because i could see all of his flaws, as well as the flaws in our relationship. 

Im really scared because i feel that everything with this guy was perfect. He was perfect, we worked well together, we worked perfect sexually, he is genuinely the smartest, kindest, funniest person ive ever met. 

I feel devastated right now and im so so scared that im never going to be able to get over him. Is there really such thing as ‘the one who got away’?

374,Advice/support greatly needed,"Having really bad panic attacks/anxiety and depressed.

377,I need help but meds and therapy havent worked,"Ok so this might seem like a troll post but its not. Its kinda long too. Im posting this to a few forums cuz i need to vent and my mental health is suffering. Forgive me if this isnt allowed here just remove it. I just need to feel someone cares or listens even if you dont.
Im 39 m london. My whole life ive wanted a muscular girlfriend. In fact ive never had a relationship . Ive only ever been attracted to muscular women but never met any in person. Zero. I cant help it, normal women just dont do it for me. I hate it and hate feeling shallow but i cant help it. I dont think id be happy with someone regular. Obviously i know muscle doesnt last forever so personality matters , i just would have liked to meet a woman whos muscular and experience it . Its not all that matters especially long term but i cant give up on that.
Another problem is my whole life ive suffered crippling depression. I also stopped caring about life and got really fat. So naturally i feel its unfair to want a muscular gf when ic ant get fit myself. Yet i also find it hard to beat my depression feeling alone. I always hoped id find someone who could help me get fit and develop a relationship with but it never happened.
Ive been in so ,many fights online over the years verbally because i tried reaching out to fit women and always got ignored. That always triggered me because ive always felt invisible. I also have a mental,learning disability so im not exactly what youd call a catch. Im torn between knowing most muscular women wouldnt want me and hoping for someone who will. But it lead to so many arguments i regret. Ive been resentful for a long time of dudes who get muscular women. Really bitter. Its made me angry. I said a lot of vile shit to people and hurt people i regret because i felt rejected and ignored. I have tried my best to beat this with therapy but i still do it occasionally and i hate it. It makes me feel like im back at square one when i fight online with someone . I know its illogical and i know no one owes me a response,i know im in the wrong to insult. But the pain and being alone blots out my logic until later when im remorseful as hell.
I decided two years ago to try. To not give up on life which is where i was for most of my life. But its so so hard. I want to be decent and worthy of these women. But i also know even if i get fit i dont even know any muscular women so it makes it feel even more pointless when im feeling down. Because i do want to be fit but im not a fan of exercise and really am trying to get fit not just for health but because i find it unfair i want a fit woman when im not fit myself. But its so so hard to stay positive.
I am trying to be a decent less bitter angry person. It hurts to see guys who are living a life with a woman who seems great with every quality i love. I know im not entitled to love and try to remember that. I try to remember when ive been mean and rude and how i dont wanna be that way.
One woman specifically i truly began to care for and it ended in a bad argument, she later forgave me but stopped talking. Id do anything for that friendship back but i caused its loss and thats on me
Ive made some progress. Since jan ive gone from 131kg to 124 just under. But i dont feel much better and feel so far to go. And in addition i found i had a pituitary brain tumour so i need surgery at some point as well as find ing out its what cause me low test all my life. I feel so much is against me. I even feel sometimes if i die during surgery id feel better

I know this has been kinda a self pity rant i just needed to tell someone because i dont have anyone to talk to. Idk if anyone cares i just feel rock bottom. Im not giving up yet , i will keep trying to be better. Its just so hard and right now ive never felt more alone. I try so hard to be better and i just cant seem to ever get there.",1680367911.0
378,Why even keep going on,"I really really wish I was dead. People for years told me it would get better, but it hasn't. The people that have been telling me that aren't even around anymore. I don't wish to be alive anymore.

""your friends and family will be very sad if you killed yourself""

And? I've been sad nearly everyday, everyone in my life knows this. They tend to think they're associated with a ghost because of how hammered in their head they know the possibility of me killing myself is. They obviously don't like it, but they all know why I wanna do it and at this point, pretty much already grieved and mourned and just wait for the day I never get back up. I can't live for other people. No one relies on me to live anyway so there's not much to lose. I can't keep living to make other people comfortable.... Not even happy. Just comfortable.

""You should try therapy or medication""

I have. Neither work. I don't trust therapists anymore, and talking my problems out has never helped me. All any of them tell me is ""Well... That's just life"" while giving me a little shrug.

Yes, I know that's life. That's why I want to FUCKING END IT! But I have to bite my tounge and accept it otherwise I go to a hospital. I really hate hospitals.

I think within the past couple of years where my life has crumbled more than it already has, I've actually gained several mental illnesses. I was originally diagnosed with anxiety and *slight* depression, but I think that number has gone up to actual depression as well as OCD.

""You'll miss out on so many good things""

I'll also miss out on the bad. Yes good things will happen, but considering I have been suicidal for 15 years without much of a break where things have also been progressively getting worse, I think it's safe to say that maybe life just frankly isn't for me. 

""You've been doing it for this long""

Yes. And I'm tired. I am so, so tired. It doesn't matter how strong I've been to this point for however long I've done it. I don't want to anymore.

""It's selfish""

So? It's selfish to keep me alive because you want me to. Don't be a hypocrite.",1680339156.0

380,I feel so hopeless,"A little back story: The past 2 years have been absolutely brutal. In 2021 my dad was killed in a car accident and that completely turned my whole world upside down, have went into a deep depression where I don’t want to talk to anyone, a lot of days it’s hard for me to get out of bed and some days I don’t. Career wise I have tried different things such as flight attendant, becoming a content creator, fitness coach and none of those things have worked out for me. I even flew out to Colorado alone to go to a career fair for United airlines in hopes of landing a job as a flight attendant and I still didn’t get a job. I have been pursuing content creation and fitness coaching for 3 years and I cannot get in sustainability in it. I’ve decided that I’m going to go to esthetician school because I feel like I don’t have any other option because I can’t get any sustainability in what I really want to do which is fitness coaching and at least with esthetician, it’s something I may halfway life because I like skincare.

395,"Me (36F) and husband (35M) in this endless ""you're not listening to me"" cycle","I'm in an endless cycle with my husband who has depression:

- he wants to talk to me about a rubbish situation or his feelings, which often make me feel uncomfortable because he has very strong feelings about things that I don't think deserve any emotional airtime.

- I very calmly suggest ways he can make his situation better or make himself feel better about things.

- he shuts all of my suggestions down.

- I get frustrated and throw more ideas at him.

- he rejects my ideas again and tells me that he just wants someone to listen.

- I get angry and tell him I was listening and he's basically setting me up for failure by complaining about feelings he's not willing to try and fix.

- he gets angry and tells me he just wanted someone to be there for him and that he can't talk to me any more.

- we don't speak for a day. 

- the cycle repeats.

How can I make him see that me suggesting solutions to his problems *IS* me being there for him? That he is, in fact, being a massive AH for not being willing to improve his life? And that I'm trying my best to help him? 

Example: it's 4am and he can't sleep. I ask him what he's done to help himself sleep. He says nothing. I say, ok, well let's get some lavender oil and a valerian tea and you might be able to drop off. He says I'm not listening to him and that he didn't ask for my help. I argue the toss that if he can't sleep and wants to, he needs to actually do something to make it happen. He says that I don't understand. I agree, I really really don't understand - so I go and make us both a valerian tea, put some lavender oil on his pillow and I go TF back to sleep.

400,Last month was the 5th anniversary of my suicide attempt and I still kinda wish I had succeeded," 

I  nearly went through but I didn't have the guts to do it, plus I was  still in love with a friend of mine. Over the months following the  attempt I tried getting closer to her but fucked up and ended up being  rejected and ruining our friendship. Since then I've not been able to  cope with this rejection, I still think about her daily even though it's  been 5 years. I've been on therapy almost non-stop since 2017, but it  didn't stop me from trying to kms in 2018 nor helped me for my  heartbreak I've been carrying since late 2018.

From  then it has been a loop of 1 step forward 2 steps back. I've dropped  out of college, took 1 year off to work on myself, went to therapy once  to twice a week, yet still felt miserable during this year. Then I  started another college in 2020, my first year was completely online  because of covid, I passed despite feeling a bit sad. In my second year I  decided to be more social in order to get out of my loneliness and  depression. It went well the first semester, I joined the English  student club where we did bi-weekly activity, and I made some friend.  The start of the second semester went well too, but for some reason, in  the middle of the semester (april 2022) the pain from my heartbreak  which was slowly getting milder came again full force. I had more  trouble going to the club activities and failed several classes. The  summer of 2022 I felt miserable the entire time, I wasn't able to do  anything other than playing videogames and staying on my computer. The  worst is that there was a lot of things I wanted to do, I just didn't  have the energy.

Then off to my  3rd year, which started last fall. Since I had to retake several classes  this was more my second year bis and I had less hours per week. But  still I struggled validating class due to sadness and fatigue. I also  struggled to go to the club's activities and connect with other people.  Winter break was like summer's, I couldn't do much and felt miserable.  Now I'm in the spring semester and I have even fewer classes and I still  struggle. I did not go to any of the club's activities nor talked to  any of my friends there, because it all feels pointless. I feel tired,  sad, heartbroken, and also ashamed for still being heartbroken 5 years  after the rejection. I don't do much these days, I risk failing my  semester and losing my friends.

402,Stop waiting for motivation. (The best tip I have to offer for tackling your depression mess with very little effort.),"After making a post in this sub asking for help, I realised something I do could help others... So I decided to ignore my anxiety and make a post about it in the hopes that it may benefit other people.

It's so easy for your space to become a mess, particularly when you're struggling, but I think so many people make a mistake by waiting for motivation.

Yes, motivation will eventually hit and you may manage to tackle a lot that has been piling up when that happens... But that means the things you accomplish are riding on something unpredictable and out of your control. Learning to do things when you aren't motivated is so beneficial...

&#x200B;

Start drinking more. Ideally water, as you're probably not hydrated enough anyway (I'm not here to judge), but anything works. I try to make a habit of having water available alongside other drinks. Keeping both within arm's reach is paramount.

Most of us can't escape that we have to go to the restroom multiple times a day. Even if you spend every other minute curled up in your blankets, you still have to get up and use the restroom. 

(If you wear diapers or this will not work for you for any other reason, my ""fetch"" method may work more for you. If neither will work, comment explaining why and I can try to help. Inclusivity is so important.)

&#x200B;

So, we've established that you're up out of your nest multiple times a day for a few minutes at least. This is where my tip comes in. Before you return to your nest, you need to do one thing.

One thing. That could be moving a dish to the kitchen, picking up trash, or anything else! After that, you can sit down and go back to whatever you were doing. It shouldn't take much more time than just going to the restroom would.

Even if you can do only one thing every time you get up... Picking up one piece of trash every time you go to the restroom means you will have dealt with multiple pieces of trash by the end of the day.

If you can accomplish more than one thing every time you get up, that's great! However, the point is to add in tasks as quickly and easily as possible so it feels like you're not doing any work. Tell yourself you need to do one thing, anything else is a bonus.

&#x200B;

A variation of this method is... basically playing fetch with yourself. I do it with cigarettes, but you could use your phone or anything else you will need multiple times a day.

Put the item somewhere you can't reach. This means you will have to get up to retrieve it... And while you're up, you implement the exact same method. Deal with one thing before you sit back down.

&#x200B;

If any part of your home is in disarray and you've been struggling with it, please stop waiting for motivation and try this, even if just for a few days. Hydrate yourself and chip away at it little by little.

Promise me (and yourself) that you won't just read this and not try it if you think it'll help you. Remember that you deserve to be comfortable, and to find ways to manage that are easy and accessible to you. You do not need to conform to pre-existing standards or norms.

&#x200B;

If you try this, feel free to let me know how it goes. I will try to respond to any comments (though it might take a while). I'll offer any support and advice that I can.

You've got this. I believe in you. I truly believe anyone can do this.",1680211934.0
403,Very unhealthy obsession,"
Extremely unhealthy obsession with someone- I am going to try to be as honest as possible for my sake this time. 
I would like to start off saying I have many mental illnesses making me struggle daily and I know this is not a normal thing for the average person, this is why I’m telling my story.

I’ve always looked up to this man, I’ve always been attracted to him and kind of liked the way he was so mean and degrading to me. Sometimes he’d want nothing to do with me and I was okay with that, then sometimes he’d want to speak with me which felt like a big rush, like when you find out super super exciting news. We were never close and I was never super obsessed with him because I knew I could never get to the point of having him

Let’s go back to a year ago from now. Finally he shows actual interest in me, we start rambling about so many things that both him and I are very passionate about, he doesn’t want me to stop talking to him, we spoke for hours and hours giving me an insane rush. 3 days staying up all night talking to eachother.  Him and I were both in a terrible mental state at that time and what was said and done shouldn’t have been. He tells me he thinks he likes me… or maybe loves, which was really confusing to him as he’s never felt this way for me. I spilled everything and told him I’ve always been attracted to him and that I really like him too. 

I’m going to leave out some parts here so this isn’t easily identified as me.. sorry  

Things happened and him and I weren’t able to talk for a bit, I obsessed over him. I would cry and throw up about how much I missed him- note that we didn’t even talk much before the whole “I like you” situation happened, I couldn’t sleep, I would drink every day, I was so sick and miserable in my life. I would write messages to him every single day or throughout the day and create notes as if I was speaking with him. I was disgustingly obsessed

I eventually convinced myself I’d never speak to him again and created a chat alone with his name and spoke to that as if he was dead. I would say how much I miss him and beg for him to come back, I would scream and cry begging for him to come back. It was horrible and disgusting 

He comes back a couple months later and we try to catch up, I am still extremely obsessed with this man and sick to my stomach. I would stare at my phone waiting for a reply from him, I would set alarms for his schedule so I could speak to him, I tried my best not to show how strung up I was though. If he didn’t reply accordingly I would have panic attacks and feel like he hates me. Eventually It all built up and I was frustrated in the moment and I ended up blocking him on everything so I’d stop speaking to him, it hurt for a very long time afterwards but I eventually started thinking about him less and less. I recovered from this addiction.

3 days ago I had a dream about this man and he will not stop running through my head. I am so tired of this and I need help but the help isn’t helping. Please don’t comment if you’re going to call me crazy, I know. I’m diagnosed with many mental illnesses.",1680244967.0
404,On the surface,"I smile brightly when engaged, I’ve been told I’m friendly, funny, and charming. I have a self deprecating sense of humor. I have a gf and a simple car that’s almost paid off. But beneath the surface, consciousness feels like a curse. The cruelest sickest joke of all time. I am broke, deeply in debt and despite being told I am smart I am a failure with a low paying job and no ability to go back to school. Even if I could go back to school I was always a poor student for a few different reasons. I have anxiety and very low self esteem. If I could I would ask my parents why they did this to me. Why did they bring me into this world. If I was sure I wouldn’t go to hell for it I would’ve killed myself already, years ago probably. While I don’t want to hurt the people who care about me there’s a gnawing sensation that they would be fine if not better off without me. If nothing else they’d get over it because their minds aren’t malfunctioning like mine. The possibility of another 30-40 more years alive on this planet are irritating and horrifying. I don’t want to do this at all anymore. Off the top of my head I tried Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Lamectil, Rexulti, Abilify, Effexor and Klonopin. Adderall was the only thing that helped raise the dopamine but a combination of substance abuse and a loss of insurance led to that ship sailing without me. I can’t really tell anyone any of this because they don’t know what to do when I say it. I’m not lonely but in a sense I’m all alone.",1680215852.0

406,My wife was getting better but she's spiraling again.,"If this is the wrong subreddit please let me know.

So I 37f have been trying to help my wife 37f. So the back story, my wife who I will refer to as R lost her mother. They were extremely close we lived with her when he health declined. R got covid and soon we all had it. September 2021 R's mom died and R spiraled to the point of hospitalization. 

So a few months my aunt from overseas came to visit we hadn't seen her since before lock down. My bother J pulled a cruel prank on her. The prank was making her think he'd factory reset her phone. She thought he'd erased texts and a single voice-mail she had. It wasn't real but she thought it was.

Things happened we're no contact with J. I got her into her therapist and she seemed to be making progress. Well her phone updated and it took a very long time to turn back on. She had a severe panic attack and even showing her the texts and having her listen to the voice-mail didn't help. I ended up taking her to the hospital where she stayed for a week and she was doing well enough to release her into my care.

But she's spiraling again, calling herself a killer cause her mom got covid from her. We had gotten her to a point she know it wasn't her fault but now we're at square one. And I know it's all J's fault I feel horrible I couldn't protect her.

What can I do? I feel helpless I can't let her spiral anymore. Please help any advice is greatly appreciated.",1680226521.0

Usually when I get asked why I look upset is when I'm zoning out. when I'm zoning out I look like I'm depressed, probably because I think of the most depressing stuff when zoning out. Sometimes when I zone out I think about what would happen if I just died, like right now, would anyone care? Or would they just forget about me.

With a total of 9 semesters (3 of those being co-op terms/work placements) I know I'm extremely burnout, and burnout has led to depression. I'm on semester 8 of 9 and I'm stuck. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and, because I was already struggling, I decided to get accommodations for college. This led to dropping a very large course to reduce my workload, but this decision has been haunting me ever since. 

I dropped a 9 credit core course after speaking with several advisors and coordinators to ensure this wouldn't greatly impact my education and that I could take it again. Everyone said yes, so I dropped it. Once I took it again, I fell into a very bad depression and ended up failing. Now, I'm here, barely passing and terrified because they only let you take a course 3 times.

I just want all of this to stop. I can't drop out because I'm so close to being graduated, but I can't keep going because I'm so burnout and depressed. I'm stuck. I just don't want to be here anymore.",1680142354.0

1) he wants biological kids. So do I, but due to my own intense medical issues I would much rather adopt. Pregnancy could be dangerous and extremely painful for me and I’m not sure I would ever intentionally get pregnant. I kidded myself for a while bc I liked him so much that I would go through with it…. But a current pelvic pain flare up has reminded me that it’s a hell no. 
(Side note I do pelvic physical therapy and everything I can to help, the cause is IBS and trauma… potentially endometriosis, but undiagnosed) 
2) recently when I opened up to him about suicidal thoughts he said he could only stay in the relationship if he knew I was doing what I could to get better. I said I am but he needs to understand it’s chronic and I will have flareups no matter what. 

Lately it feels like the honeymoon phase is over… and I just can’t lead myself or him on anymore. 
My pelvic pain and POTS make me feel worthless and hopeless. 
One of my biggest fears is that I won’t be able to financially support myself because of them…. And see the boyfriend is very financially stable, home owner, all that…. So that promise of stability was a security blanket the last few months.

Idk if my hesitation in breaking up with him is because of the security blanket, or just my morbid depression talking. Either way I really wish I was dead, but I refuse to abandon my cat.

I'm neurodivergent with a few mental health disorders and chronic pain. Unable to work, benefits are my only income, and I live alone (stable, for now).

I don't really have friends. Technically have one irl but we're not close and text very rarely. I have some family members I text sporadically but only see one of them on a semi regular basis. I know some people online, but interaction is limited there too.

I guess I'm ""lonely"", but isolated is more accurate. I'm not a social person and don't seem to crave connection as much as others but I still feel lonely sometimes.

I don't leave my apartment unless I have to, which is usually just picking up things from stores. I don't like going outside and don't have much reason to. Most of my time is spent alone, on the couch, watching YouTube, unable to do much of anything. I'm kind of only alive to get drunk and high, which isn't a life worth living.

It's becoming increasingly difficult to care for myself and my space. I hate mess and feeling unclean, but I'm such a mess mentally that it's started to manifest itself in a physically and seeps into everything around me. The energy I'm able to muster to tidy up is too little and too infrequent to keep up with anything. I feel disgusting. It's as if I'm festering.

I've started to gain weight. Not much, but enough to have triggered the eating disorder I had under control for so long. I know cutting back on alcohol will help with that, due to alcohol itself and sometimes ordering takeout food I don't even like and makes me feel ill (often order because I get hungry and don't have enough food in my apartment, but I'm no stranger to food for self harm, which I'm sure other people with bpd can relate to). Exercise is another problem for reasons, but I will post about that somewhere else.

I can't exist like this for much longer. I've covered all the mirrors in my apartment so I don't have to see my reflection.

(Disclaimer: I don't care how others look. My standards are for myself and myself only. I hate people assuming I'm fatphobic or judge others just because I have an eating disorder...)

&#x200B;

These are the only things I've managed to do so far, but I want to make it clear that I don't think of these as achievements...

\- I don't get drunk and/or high every single night now, though I'm only at one day on, one day off. I'm slowly feeling less need to drink every night.  
\- Started to buy fruit again. I eat a piece or a few pieces every day I'm actually eating.  
\- Buying cheaper alcohol so I waste less money.  
\- Dirty dishes are left to soak... Which is one step done.  
\- All of my clothes were on my floor. Now only a few are.  
\- Try to use wipes while I'm struggling to shower and shaved so I don't have a neckbeard.  
\- Started using Duolingo, but already failed at keeping my streak.

Need to try reading again, duolingo, cutting down on alcohol, and cleaning more. Might write a post about my tip for others trying to clean in my situation. Less money on alcohol means I can afford better food, and I can try to save for a PC.

I've hit my breaking point and am trying to not give up on myself anymore than I already have, but I'm always stuck in two minds thanks to half of my personality laughing at me when I'm struggling. Kinda scared that I've regressed too much to recover fully.

If you think I'm disgusting or pathetic that's fine, I just would prefer help, advice, and constructive criticism rather than anything too degrading. Any interaction is fine though.

I'll try to be as open as possible with suggestions and advice, though I will explain if something wouldn't work for me. I just don't want it to come across as if I'm shutting down anyone for trying to help me.

And uh I really do appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply or offer help. I'm sorry that this post is long...",1680093704.0
428,Dad just mentioned suicide,"I've (18M) been on vacation for the past few days with my mom and dad, and things have been a little bit tense overall. My dad has always been a bit sensitive and very open about his mental health, especially in regards to struggling with dysthymia and depression. Tonight, when we were walking around on the beach after some serious tension in the family, he begin hinting at suicide. At first, it was in reference to the idea of nonbeing, then more explicitly about how he found the samurai code to be brave in its own right. (He taught english in Japan for 20 or so years)

Eventually, he caved and explicitly said that sometimes he contemplates suicide and doesn't want to live. My mom and I immediately went to support him, but he kept saying he was fine and just to enjoy the sunset. I have never seen him like this before, and after awhile he said that he didn't want to die in the moment, that be wasn't planning on killing himself ""within the next year, at least"", and so on. I have never, ever seen him like this, and this is the first and only time my dad has ever just completely broken down to such an extent.


He then, after some more frantic talk, said that he absolutely wouldn't, especially if I would feel responsivle. We went back to the hotel room where things were largely in silence for a long time, with him laying in bed. He went to take a very long shower, came out, and said firmly that he wouldn't kill himself. I repeatedly floated calling services immediately but he was adamant that it was something he needed to say, not that he intended to do.

My mom and I both told him we loved him, and he reciprocated. She seems to be in a state of shock.

He told us that sometimes he loves life too much, and that's what makes it so painful for him. He said that more than depressed, he feels cruelly attached to living. He seems very very distant, and has fallen asleep without many more words (aside from giving me the Hemingway quote (his favorite author) about how life breaks people, but they heal, while others resist it, and are killed by it. The end of the quote basically states that for those who aren't exceptional, life will take its time, though it does get to all of us.)

He has always felt responsible for so many things that aren't his fault, often times including my own struggles and those of his mother (who he sadly has a poor relationship with, due to her role in his upbringing). He's also tried SSRIs, which stopped working some years back, SNRIs, and even moderate psilocybin and MDMA doses. Nothing seems to work. He has been an amazing dad throughout the years, but feels terrible for the few mistakes he's made. I've tried on and on to convince him that my own mental health issues aren't his fault, but he's been adamant.

He's also been very insistent on ""getting things sorted out"" and ""making things right"". He can't seem to elaborate on what these things mean. He's seemed much worse mentally these past few months, which I suspect may also be related to the fact that his father (with whom he is very close) is likely slipping into dementia.

We are driving home tomorrow. I need help and advice on what the fuck to do. I'm going to college in the fall and am shit scared and feel like the floor has just been torn out from under me. Please help.",1680070292.0
429,How do you guys manage a job?,"I'm 23, been working full time since 17 just making money to pay bills. I'm at a point now where I just can't bare it any longer. 

Longest I've stayed at job is nearly 2 years but I've found once I get used to a job that's when the monotony hits me and the only way to motivate myself to work is find a new job. I can't keep doing this, I'm tired feeling the need for a new job every 6 months. It's hard, at the moment I feel the need for a mental health day once a fortnight and it pretty just completely pisses off the owner (and rightly so, he shouldn't be left short because I can't get out of bed).

I guess what I'm asking is if anyone who frequently experiences job burnout due to depression has ever found a career path that lessens this or perhaps how to handle the constant need to skip days of work. I just can't stop thinking of myself as a burden at any workplace I'm at. I work really hard and I'm pretty switched on, just some days I really can't face the world and it just puts me in the bad books wherever I go.

Sorry for the text wall, I'm just so stuck at the moment and would even just love to know I'm not alone in these feelings.",1680063170.0
430,Why can't I just be happy?,"I've been struggling with depression for 15 years now, so since childhood. The therapists and psychiatrists can't decide whether it's depression or bipolar or some kind of mix between the two. I feel so alone, even though there are people around me. I feel like I have no one to talk to who will understand and not give me the ""think happy thoughts"" crap. The people whom I feel I can talk to are there for me, but somehow I always feel like I don't get enough attention and commitment from them and I feel that it's unfair to demand more, just because I'm feeling shitty. I want to stop breathing and stop existing so often and if it weren't for promises I made to friends, I don't think I'd be here anymore. I want to do self-destructive things, but I know that once I feel a little better, I'll regret them. It feels like the people I can talk to, either don't understand or aren't there for me as I need them to be. I just need someone who will stick around and not make time for me whenever they have some free time to dedicate. I'm so tired and so alone. I want to be able to get out of bed. I want to be able to be excited about a new day, without knowing what it holds and I want to be happy, without being afraid of when I'll hit rock bottom again. Why must it be such a struggle? I'm blind, so the things I could do to keep my mind occupied are so limited and when I feel like this, nothing holds my attention.

He was already in depression before for various reasons (ex : health issues, career issues, childhood trauma, manipulative father) but the death of his mom (the only person in his household who was kind to him) just broke him completely. He cannot sleep. It's been so long.  We are trying to avoid sleeping medication because it will just start a vicious cycle.

434,Retail vs. Pub Job and Mental Health,"Hello, 26[F] from London, UK. I'm interviewing for two jobs this week. One with a retail store and one with a pub but I'm trying to decide which I'd be best suited to. My previous job history was working in an art gallery, doing social media and ambassadorships at university.


I've been out of proper employment for about 5 years due to my poor mental health. I'm bipolar type one with treatment resistant depression and I suffer from anxiety disorders as well as agoraphobia. So I've known I'm not very reliable when it comes to mind mood if I'm in a bad way. I'm doing a bit better now and really need some work.


The retail job is low pressure but I'd have to commute to central London which makes me very anxious as I have a particular anxiety around travel. But the pub job is more local but it could be subject to a higher pressure environment. And more difficult customers. 


In an ideal world I would choose retail locally but that's not an option. So I was wondering which would serve me best given my condition. A friend mentioned that I'd meet a lot of people at the pub which is a plus for me as that's also part of my motivation for working is to make friends. I know people say that retail is the worst but this is a higher end company that also sells home goods. So it's not as stressful as somewhere like Primark for example.


I was also wondering, which environment is best for if I'm having a bad day or something. talking to my therapist she said she'd be fine with someone not all happy and smiley at the pub as long as the service is good. but in retail I don't know if I could get away with that.


Thanks if you've read this far and have any advice for me. Appreciate it.",1680057094.0

443,I’m having some doubts about my relationship,"I (20m) have been dating my girlfriend (20f) for almost 6 months. I come from a family that’s decently well off and hers isn’t, which has never bugged me or played a factor in our relationship. There have been some instances where her play teasing has turned to genuinely insulting and I told her off for it and she immediately apologized and said she’d make up for it. I was trying to be helpful last week with something she had going wrong technologically and she blew up at me about that, also to apologize immediately and say she’d make up for it.

Today we had a bit of a moral discussion regarding shoplifting (long story) and she said that she thought it was perfectly moral so long as it was from a major store and wasn’t hurting any employees. I said that even then it’s still wrong and called moral fault on her part. She said that I’d never understand because I haven’t had to deal with struggling for food before and calling me privileged etc etc so i don’t have a say. I’m legitimately pretty pissed off about that and haven’t responded. I get that stealing from a major company isn’t nearly as wrong as from a small business or anything, but honestly it speaks to her moral character in a way I am not happy with. Besides that, the fact that she was the one who started attacking me for the wealth divide between us reminded me of my ex who had similar tendencies and used that as a point of manipulation and justification to attack me on certain issues. 

I’m not really sure how to move forward. On the one hand, it doesn’t seem like it’s that big of a deal since she herself hasn’t shoplifted before, but on the other hand I think that virtuous character is really important in a partner and the fact that she was willing o die on this hill and call me a terrible person about Makes me wonder if she’s someone I really want to be with.

455,Depression Contributing Factors/Weather,"(Context below) The last few months I (24M) have been probably severely depressed: takes an hour + to get out of bed, staying up extremely late, suppressed appetite, zero motivation, easily addicted to coping. 

My days the last 4-5 months look like this: wake up. Scroll, eat, scroll, eat, scroll, shower, gym, video games, sleep. I feel extremely depressed and use my phone and video games as a coping mechanism to avoid real life and this depressed feeling I dont know how to deal with. It's like my brain is addicted to the relief and the chemicals it's deprived of (serotonin/dopamine etc.) and its so strongly addicted I just cant even focus on real life tasks before I get sucked back in. 

The depressed feeling is taking over my life and forcing me into a constantly numbing brain coma that is addicted to scrolling and gaming to escape. 

So my productivity day to day is extremely low/nothing. I feel like i'm forgetting about my goals and ambitions slowly as the years go by. My standards are slowly being lowered. And i'm afraid if I dont find the cause i'll be like this the rest of my life, in my 40s, 50s etc with a family. 

**\*\*context\*\*** I've been trying to solve this for a long time and here are all the factors i've considered. In my childhood my mother was/is an alcoholic, and very emotionally unstable and predictable. It was usually a chaotic household which I think has created a lot of emotional issues and thought processes in me as a child that I have grown up with since. I'm also afraid her addiction genes may have been passed down to me.

I own a pressure washing business in Ohio, so my work is seasonal and dependent on the weather. This means during the summer I make a lot of money (relative) and in the winter I make none. So the financial anxiety and guilt and overthinking sets in and life goes downhill. This has made me tie a lot of happy emotions and excitement to sunny days and sadness and depression to cloudy, cold days. Which has been a big factor in the way I feel now (It's been cold). 

I'm very physically healthy. Serious about the gym/diet/supplements and have a coach, may compete in bodybuilding in a few years. So I know diet and activity is not an issue. 

I think also having some kind of external accountability (all my work tasks and customers) plays a huge factor. When i'm busy, especially in the summer, I dont have time to scroll and play games. My plate is too full and i'm extremely busy. So in the winter I dont have any external accountability to anyone except my cat, so I dont let anyone down by not showing up.

Last year I realized when I was making a lot of money in the summer, going on trips, living a life that life felt fine. I felt normal and happy, ambition through the roof, and couldnt believe how I felt in the winter, the feeling felt so foreign. And now it's back.

Anyway I feel like I have almost answered my issue here now that I have listed everything out. But I have considered moving to a southern state like Florida where it's warm and sunny year round and I can work and enjoy life and (hopefully) be happy all year. But has anyone experienced depression like this? Has anyone moved to a warmer place and been cured? All thoughts and comments are encouraged to be shared. TIA",1679954645.0

457,Changing myself for a job when I already have low self esteem,"This is mostly a rant to get my feelings out. 

So I started a job as a salon assistant 6 months ago and I love it. I love all the stylists, I feel like I fit in, I feel like Im getting along with everyone. I tried really hard to show that I was a hard worker and wanted to be there, and I thought it was paying off. We have individual meetings with the owner every other month and each time she said I was doing well and everyone was giving me positive feedback. 

Here's where the bad stuff starts. I started to get comfortable around everyone, to the point where I felt ok being myself. I can be kind of blunt and sarcastic sometimes. I always try and soften it with lots of ""just kiddings!"" and just by being an overall cool and nice person most of the time, but I know it can come off wrong sometimes. 

So today my boss called me in and said that she was getting feedback from some of the stylists saying that my attitude rubbed them the wrong way. That I was too sassy, and said some rude things, and acted like I didnt want to do my job. It completely blindsided me. I thought I was getting along with everyone and that I was well liked. No one gave me any indication that I was doing something wrong. 

The problem is that I have really low self esteem and I've worked hard to accept and love this part of myself, because it feels like something I can't change. I've never tried to be blunt or sarcastic, it just kind of happens. Often times I'll say things that come off as rude and I'll have no idea I came off that way until someone tells me. Even when I try and say things correctly, I still come off wrong.  

I'm freaking out because I'm already so hard on myself and I stress about every conversation I have because I want people to like me so bad. But apparently everything I've been doing is wrong, so I have to just put on a mask and be sugary sweet so no one thinks bad of me. Which sucks because I really like this job and want to fit in as myself. I dont know what to do. I want people to know I'm a good person who wants to contribute but I don't want to police myself and self analyze bc I'll just end up hating myself.",1679953340.0
458,Mental health and physical symptoms,"Does anyone have any advice they can share about overcoming some physical symptoms that go along with depression? 

I’m currently dealing with some pretty significant back and shoulder pain that I’m in physical therapy for, but the progress is really slow. I think a lot of it has to do with stagnation during my most recent and most serious depressive episode that has been going on for about 7ish months. I don’t know if I’m just out of shape or if some chemical imbalance causes all the muscle tension and pain.

I also experience GI symptoms, which I understand to be pretty common for people struggling with mental health. For me, these symptoms aren’t too severe most of the time. 

My physical health is a huge barrier for me right now. My main focus over the past couple months has been getting better, but it’s so hard to improve my situation when I have considerable physical pain every second of my life. I never feel okay, the best I can hope for is discomfort. It’s so hard to get my shit together and have a job while dealing with this. It’s getting tedious dealing with medical appointments that don’t improve my situation.

Because I have no energy and I'm always sad, I can not make friends or keep them. Nobody wants to be around someone like that and it's not their fault. You can not blame somebody normal for treating a weirdo like a pariah.

I have had relationships, but most were one sided because I was stupid and assumed someone could care about me. I think one loved me for a few minutes but ultimately, he chose another.

Even if my inside were not shattered and fucked up, my outside is disgusting. To know the ins and outs both are completely undesirable is a personal hell. Why am I here if I serve no purpose? You don't hoard tools you have no use for. You don't buy food you will not eat.

I'm 25/f living in Aus.

I want to say thank you for everyone who has tried to support me in some way or another. You all mean so much to me. Just know that it's not your fault. I am a lil broken.

For the people who caused some of my heart ache. It's okay. You all had your all demons you were/ are fighting. Please don't stress at all.

I seem to have hit a point where I'm self medicating to a really unhealthy amount. I suspect that I will accidentally die of alcohol poisoning soon or something of that nature. Don't worry about me though. I just am trying to silence the voices in my own head. The ones that tell me I'm too fat, too dumb, too ugly to ever be worth anything to anyone.

I have tried to be quite open about the state of my wellbeing. I thought it was obvious how I am at home with my cats alone but no one can come save you. You need to save yourself. And sometimes you just do not have the strength. I am alone. I make it that way. I gave up trying I guess... But anyways... It's my fault and I need to stop being a bother to people.

When I think of something that I was convinced about during my depression (I know I will die alone), now I can't help but not identify that as true and kind of laugh, because it's obviously false. It could happen, but it's not likely. If this had happened a week ago, I would be crying in bed wanting to die.

It may seem that way in the moment, I know. You may feel shame for needing help. You may feel shame for not being able to fix it yourself. But you weren’t designed to do this all on your own. No one was. And anyone that says otherwise is kidding themselves. 

You’re more human for wanting/needing help, not less. 

What’s more important is that you’ll be thankful for it in the long run, and after some time has passed and you’ve gotten better, you’ll find that taking that step—asking for help and allowing yourself to receive it—was the best thing you could’ve done for yourself.

479,Is there something I could've done for my depressed friend?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place, but I really need some advice on this.

My friend has been depressed and other major mental illness (dissociation, etc.). She was never properly diagnosed, but I've always been there for her for a few years. 

I know there is only a little a bystander could do. I never wished to fix her, but I just want her to have a choice when she's struggling. I want her to know I'll be available when she needs help, so suicide or self-harm doesn't have to be the only choices. Though she doesn't want to burden anyone, she accepted it at first, and she also comes to me often for vents.

The problem is, sometimes it's just hard to separate comforting and ""fixing"". There are a lot of times where she struggled to be helped bcs of her distorted mindsets, so I had to keep ""correcting"" her. She doesn't think her feelings/opinions matter, she doesn't think she deserves anything, she doesn't want to burden others with her troubles, she doesn't think she's allowed live her own life so she solely lives for others (family, friends, teachers, etc.). Because of all these negative thoughts, I had to tell her otherwise. I wanted to let her know she matters, so I tried to let her feel comfortable to just be herself. But then there would be times where I feel like I overstepped. I truly want to validate her feelings, but what if the feelings are self-destructive? What if she insists to let it all go, and decided she's not gonna live for herself anymore? To comfort her I had to keep correcting her, but what if its not the right thing to do in the first place.

Recently she came to me about a problem. This problem has been existed for so long and usually I just sides with her and listened to her. This time I probably should've been supportive as usual, but instead I got ahead of myself and tried to be involved in the problem. I did ask her if she would like to hear my opinion in advanced, but I should've know she's a pushover and would say yes to anything. Things didn't end well, but at that time I really thought it was the right thing to do. I can always listen to her and comfort her as she sinks into a pit. But I just wanted to give her a pull, an actual help that might change the horrible situation she's going through. Should I have just let her know I'm willing to help if she's comfortable with it, even knowing she would never choose to be helped bcs of her deeply-rooted negative thoughts? Is there nothing I could do except being there for her while she self-destruct? Where's the line between helping and overstepping? 

P.S. She is already going to therapy. She doesn't feel good about it and wants to quit the therapy.

She's also very isolated. She has a toxic family and no other friends to reach out to. I'm the only one she feels more comfortable with, but even still she's often reluctant to burden me.

I am destroyed and hurting so much.

I lost hope. I was always positive even when times were hard. I always believed hard work and sacrifices will eventually pay off. I always believed that if I do good I will eventually reap the benefits. I have always tried to be kind, generous, helpful and compassionate with everyone I encountered, no matter who they were.

I’ve broken down in front of my sister, but i don’t think she actually understands. I think she thinks it’s about school, but it’s not just about school, it’s about everything. She asked if something happened at school and said “You seem depressed/sad” prolly because I haven’t really cried in front of her in a while. I don’t really like crying in front of people, so I rarely do. My sister and my dad don’t know about my other breakdowns, only the one.

492,"AI ""art"" makes me lose all hope for the future","I used to sell art commissions for people's d&d characters and stardew valley OCs and stuff like that. It was a side hustle, and I loved doing it. I only made maybe a couple hundred bucks a month doing it, so it's not like I have the biggest stake in the game, but still... since AI art came out, I haven't sold a single commission. Not a one.

The people who say using them is perfectly ethical are wrong. These AI are committing art theft, they use the art of real artists like me, without our permission, without credit to us, and without royalties to us. Not only that, they are destroying the art scene.

A human can't compete with the machine mass-production. What takes me days to make, a machine can make in seconds. What I charge $20-$60 for, a machine can give away for like, a 99c subscription. Even if my quality is better, (which as of late it often isn't, since AI are better at shading and lighting than humans are), the AI can still undercut my times and prices by a long long mile.

This is horrifying to me. Bear with me here. I'm a big hat nerd, alright? And it used to be that hats were a thing everybody wore, and went to a milliner to get it custom made for you. Your hat was a one-of-a-kind form of personal expression. But then, factory mass production happened. It killed the hatmaking trade. Now hardly anybody wears hats at all. I don't want the same thing to happen to art.

Or... or... google maps, I can't navigate without it. I don't want art to become like that! Art is what makes humans human! Why are we outsourcing this to machines!? Is this the future we want?! Scifi told us that robots would automate away the mindless drudgery of our jobs so we could spend our time focusing on what's important, like art and family. But instead, AI has taken away ART, one of the most important things in my life, leaving me with only the mindless drudgery job! God you guys, this is the darkest timeline!

This kind of shit destroys my hope for a future. What is even the point in trying anymore? God help us all.",1679766386.0

494,Runaway Teen,"I am a rambler so get ready lol.

&#x200B;

Hello, I have just turned 17, and I am considering running away from my household. I feel like my childhood was taken away from me. I have been homeschooled since I was 9, and when I was in school, I played basketball, had friends, and did fun things with them. I even had birthday parties with friends. However, now I only have one friend who barely talks to me.

&#x200B;

I feel pain every day seeing kids my age doing fun stuff while I can't. I cut and hit myself, wishing the pain would go away and I could have friends and do fun activities with them. I talked to my mom about going back to school, and she screamed at me, saying how much she did for me. I just want to have a life and not sit in the house all day.

&#x200B;

I have thought about suicide a lot, and I have thought of many ways to do it. However, every time I get a sense of hope, I get reminded of my situation. My parents don't know how severe my depression is. Every time I wake up, I just wish I could go back to sleep because that is where I feel no pain. That is why I think about taking my own life, because maybe I won't feel anything, and maybe I will just be asleep forever.

&#x200B;

My dad wants me to mow for him every day for three hours a day, every week. I have been doing it for three years now, but I don't want to do it this year because I want to have a good year for once. I set some goals this year when the year started, but my parents shut them all down. My goals are to go back to school, make friends, play football for a school, and have a sleepover with friends.

&#x200B;

The pain gets so bad that my vision gets blurry, and I feel terrible. Sometimes I feel like nothing is real, like ""how did I even get here?"" or ""maybe this is a test."" My dad recently bought a pistol, and I thought maybe that was the quickest way, but I just wanted to do it somewhere I could sit before I did, like a bridge or something.

&#x200B;

If I do it, I don't want anybody to feel pain about my death. For some reason, I want people to know about my pain, maybe for something to change, but I haven't told anyone except my parents. I didn't even know depression could get this bad. I honestly didn't think depression could be that bad at 13 years of age, but now that I am here, it sucks.

&#x200B;

When I harm myself, the physical pain overcomes the mental pain for a slight second. That is what makes it addicting. When you are in bad pain, and physical pain overcomes it. I haven't told my parents about my self-harming yet, and I honestly don't know when I will ever do it.

&#x200B;

If I ever do run away, I would get away because I am good at that stuff. I have been messing around with computers ever since I was three years old. I knew how to fully type and read at the age of four. I know survival craft decently, and I know how to make a fake ID and all of that jazz. I kind of wish I had someone to run away with, but I doubt anyone would want to leave their homes. 

&#x200B;

I know my parents care about me, it's just that I have been going through a lot. My mom has offered a therapist, but I don't think that could fix me. If I ever took my life, my mom would be devastated. She has really bad anxiety, so I don't know what would happen to her. That is probably the only thing keeping me from taking my own life, is her. I don't want her to worry about me when I do it.

&#x200B;

If I did run away, I would go out into the woods at night because I am familiar with the woods, having been raised in a hunting family, so I know the basics. Then I would move as quickly as I can away from the county because they would have police out looking for me. If I could get out of the county, that would be out of the boundary of the police unless they put some statewide alert up, which I hope doesn't happen because my face would be plastered all over Facebook and the news.

&#x200B;

I know if I run away, I won't be able to go to school or play football, which is one of two things I want to do. I would love for my dad to come pick me up after practice and tell him about the things we did during practice, and that would be like a dream for me.

&#x200B;

I was also raised in a sports family, my whole family is obsessed with basketball. I started playing basketball really young. I started playing in leagues at 3, then I started playing for schools when I was like 7 or 6, and all of my friends I used to hang out with still play basketball in high school, and most of them are sophomores or freshmen.

&#x200B;

I know most people on here are going to tell me not to run away because it sounds like I have good parents, but they have a dark side to them that does not show at times. For instance, at the beach a few months ago, my first time going to the beach with my family, I was packing a raft up the sand to our house, and they had put their stuff in the raft because they were too lazy to pack it all the way back to the house. So some of the stuff fell out and when it did, my Mom got really mad at me, like it was my fault or something. She gave me the meanest stare ever and said, ""Let's go now!"" then she said, ""I am tired of you,"" when I didn't even do anything. I did respond saying, ""I didn't do anything.""

&#x200B;

But I don't know, life just seems so pointless right now. I know I rambled a lot in this post, but I just needed to get some of this out. Anyway, love you guys! I wish all of you guys happy lives.",1679814000.0
495,I feel completely isolated,"Hi everyone
I'm a 20 f, and just as the title says I feel completely alone i felt this way for at least 5 years on and off. I'm in a town 7 hrs away from my family but it doesn't seem to matter, cause they doesn't feel like they care really. They are planning a family holiday which i can not attend at all. They never call or text me unless they want something or if they suddenly remember i exist, they otherwise ignore my texts and calls. 

3 weeks ago my ex of a year broke up with me because he was scared to fall further in love with me but soon he started regretting it, so I had to reassure him, that he made the right decision so he won't feel bad about moving on. My family would reject me if I got back with an ex.

but I seem to have found out that he was the only person that actually listen to me, or at least cared, so now I feel trapped in a life where I'm completely alone. 
I have no real friends and the only thing keeping from just leaving is the fact I can't upset people. And i know if i left my parents would be seen as bad parents.

498,Frustrated and unsure,"For the past year, I have noticed some major changes in my lifestyle and what I am naturally predisposed to. I can lie around the whole day without doing anything, I wouldn't say I feel any real emotion anymore, but when I do, it is usually negative (things like self-deprecation, overall negativity etc.). I have distanced myself from my family for the most part, and I have this weird sort of feeling similar to like a fog on my head. Granted, there are days when I feel ""ok"", but I don't think there has been a day when I felt good or great, in a long time. 

I did some searching about it, and right now, I believe that this may be depression. I have not seen a doctor to evaluate me, but to be honest, my main struggle right now is that part of me thinks I may be faking this feelings I have. That it's some sort of placebo syndrome where once I searched the symptoms, because I believed I may have depression, I sub-consciously adapted my behavior to fit those symptoms better.

IDRK, it's a weird thought I've had which has left me feeling very frustrated and pathetic. I don't think I have the strength to be confronted with the possibility that rather than I actually having depression, but that I want it, for attention or whatever.

500,"Truly, I am the most miserable self-loathing piece of shit I know.","I feel like this is over for me. 25 years old with pretty much nothing to my name aside from an apartment I didn't deserve to get. A shitty fast food job I desperately persuade myself I like (and maybe I do like it for the sole reason of being able to just not think about anything when I'm working), no meaningful connections to people, no prospect for the future.

For as long as I remember, I've never felt two things: that sweet feeling of being loved unconditionally and true happiness. The only time I can remember when I was somewhat happy was when I was on meds prescribed by my psychiatrist, and even then I know it was just an illusion and it didn't help me improve in the slightest.

Here's how my day goes: I wake up early in the morning, go to work where I at least feel okay, then fight the urge to cry as soon as my shift ends and I wait on the bus stop to go home, come home and cry for an hour or so, distract myself with YouTube and videogames, browse Tinder for a while, tell myself everyone's probably just too good for me, cry myself to sleep. Rinse and repeat. I haven't cleaned my apartment for a month at this point. I just can't make myself. Same with laundry and dishes.

I feel incapable of building trusting, healthy, meaningful relationships with other people. I'm either paranoid, too scared to trust or don't find that people are genuinely interested in me. I guess the only two people I can call friends at this point is my best friend from school, who's too obsessed with himself to be able to empathize, and my ex, who was never really able to provide support or express love the way I needed. Both are probably close to being done with my shit at this point and I try not to bother them.

I can't make myself go out or try something new. I know I'll either fail and regret it or it'll be a waste of time and I'll regret it. Besides, I hate doing things alone. I hate being alone. I feel like I need someone to pull me out of this fucking ditch but I know that person will never come, because they probably don't exist. People say that there's a person meant for everyone, but that's a lie.

I don't know who I am and what I want to be. I kind of like the idea of writing music, and I do that sometimes, but every time I start I immediately hate what I've made and abandon the project. I was thinking about saving up for a guitar when I felt somewhat better, but why even bother if I'm like King Midas, except everything I touch turns to shit. People, projects, plans, doesn't matter.

I feel like I'm not going to succeed at anything and never going to be happy. I regret every single decision I make, no matter how minor. And I know that if I did otherwise - I would regret that too. Feels like I'm just trapped in a hallway with a billion doors I could open, but I know I'm not going to like any of them.

I feel like I'm walking that thin line where a person is ""not living"" and ""not dying"", or maybe there's no person at all. I have somewhat of a passive death wish, where I'm not really going to off myself, or even influence surroundings to die, but every day I just wish a car would hit me out of nowhere, or something like a heart attack would finish me off. But that doesn't happen, so I'm probably just going to do whatever I'm doing until it's all over.

I feel like I'm beyond saving or helping. I'm going to therapy tomorrow, but it didn't help last time and I don't think it will this time. I'm a lost, broken, miserable, confused, dumb, ugly, poor, whiny piece of shit whose life is over before it even started. That is if it even truly ever started.

I'm sorry if this is not coherent. And I'm sorry if this isn't exactly the type of stuff people usually post here. I don't expect any help, advice, comfort or anything at all. I just want this to be a declaration of me giving up on myself. I will probably answer questions to provide more context if needed though, but I don't think any of you will actually read this fart to the end, and that's fine. But if you did; thanks, I guess.

503,Abilify causing urinary incontinence?,"TW: Suicide attempts


I’ve had depressed since my teenage years but it largely went untreated throughout my adult life.  After the birth of my daughter, I started seeing a psychiatrist and got on meds but had a hard time finding a combo that worked for me.  Four years ago, it got bad and I attempted suicide.  Once I was in the hospital I got a combination that finally worked: cymbalta, buspar, and abilify.  I don’t have bipolar but what the doctor called “treatment-resistant depression.”  Two years ago I tried to go off the meds in an attempt to try to get pregnant.  It was a disaster.  Another attempt, another psych admission.  Since then I’ve stayed on my meds.

A few years ago I started noticing I was having trouble holding my bladder.  It resulted in almost complete incontinence.  I wear poise pads daily.  I saw a urogynecologist who implanted a nerve stimulator in my left hip in an attempt to fix it.  It did not work.  

Like I said this was all a few years ago, last summer we moved out of state and I no longer have a psychiatrist (I see a therapist via telehealth every two weeks).  I got so fed up with the problem that I went to my general doctor.  She couldn’t find a reason for a 37 year old woman to be peeing her pants until she checked my med list: apparently abilify can cause urinary incontinence.  I realized that the incontinence started around the time I started on abilify.  I’m conflicted.  I don’t want to go off meds again, but I would REALLY like to not pee my pants anymore.  The doctor referred me to a urologist but also to a psychiatrist.  I don’t know how long it will take to get into a psych in our new state.  Are there similar meds to abilify that DONT cause urinary incontinence?  Has anyone else gone through this?  I don’t know what to do!",1679773505.0

It’s almost impossible for me to get through the classes. I can’t stop imagining what it must be like for the patients, what it must be like for the family etc... For example he teacher was talking about how the patient felt intense guilt for passing genes for a disease a to her children and suddenly I felt how terribly she must’ve felt and it (and I hate this word) triggered my suicidal thoughts. Like I have them all the time, but I can usually distract myself with studies.

It’s getting ridiculous. The moment I hear just a mention of a tragedy or something remotely negative, I can’t stand it. No sad movies, no sad music, no news. I never had this problem before. I am supposed to do volunteering in the future but I can’t do this either.

507,Would love some help figuring out what i might have.,"Could you guys help me get an idea of what might be wrong with me? I'm going in soon to see a psychiatrist hopefully, been calling and emailing people. But until then I need to find a way to help myself, and I know that if I could just figure out what I might be dealing with I can help myself a lot better.

1. I've already been diagnosed with bipolar 1 and I've tried many medications, but weed is the only one that ever really worked in any way.

2. I've been to many therapists and doctors and stuff but none of them really seems to help me. It's not because of them, I think I'm beyond therapy. Not in a negative way but just in a way that I'm not going to solve my mental illness by going to therapy. I most likely need some kind of medication and maybe some very specialized therapy if any. 

3. I have massive anxiety attacks that reduce me to a pile of tears in the corner. These feelings seem to be detached in the way that I can't influence them. It's not like what I'm having them I think the world is actually ending, it just feels like that and I don't know why. The intensity can vary but I don't self harm and only once has it gotten so bad that I contemplated a permanent solution. That type of thing is definitely not normal even for my anxiety attacks and has never happened since.

My anxiety is like a little monster that decides it's time to fucking panic for your life at random and there's not much I can really do about it. Nothing I can personally think or say to myself has ever been able to influence the monster. Medication has only slightly delayed its influence but by living a peaceful lifestyle and not overwhelming myself I managed to get into a good place. Now I'm finding myself becoming busy again and unable to handle that stress.

Hi, I’m nearly 22 years old and I found out that I was autistic 3 years ago. It didn’t change anything to my life. I still live the same, I’m still me. My life is alright I have my family around me and I have never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that. But I now realize that from my teenage years, I would have periods where I’m super happy, so happy that it’s like I was on drugs, and right after I would feel so low that I would pray to god that I would just die in my sleep and never wake up again. When I was 13/14 years old, I would hurt myself. I would kick stuff really hard until my foot swelled, I would plant needles into my hand, I even broke my slate once to cut myself. I also used the kitchen knife sometimes. I always made sure to not cut too deep so that there would be no scar so my family never found out. I ended up forgetting about it for a while, but it came back to me last week. I don’t know why I had stopped hurting myself but I remembered that it would make me feel better then so I decided that I would start again. But it didn’t work. This time it’s worse than all of the previous times. I swear that 3 weeks ago I was the highest I’d ever been. I thought that I had finally got my life together. I was feeling happy, productive and everything. But then it all crashed back down and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can have a happy future, I don’t find anything enjoyable in my present. I lost interest in everything and everyone and I don’t know why. I want to die. It’s the only thing I can do to save myself. I know that it would upset my family but at the same time, after I die, nothing will matter. I bought myself a new knife. It’s not super sharp but it would do the work. My mom saw my cuts this time and she’s angry. She tried to take it from me but I fought her for it. I thought that I needed it. I can no longer sleep if I don’t cut myself and I feel like it’s gonna stop working soon. I almost cut my wrists twice, but my sister was home. I didn’t want to be found and rushed to the hospital. I could go into the woods near the house but I’m scared to go out. My mom demanded many times that I call a psychiatrist but I don’t know what to say when I call. She thinks that I have anxiety and insomnia. I don’t want her to know how I really feel, she would get worried. I can’t tell her, she already has a lot on her plate. My younger sister and my older brother have been depressed for a while now and I know that she misses my dad, he died a few years ago. I can’t make her worry about me too.

510,I'm worried everything is my fault,"I really hope my friends don't find this haha it be really embarrassing if they did.

I've been talking to this new person and I really genuinely like talking to them, I appreciate their time and everything but I constantly worry maybe im doing something to make them uncomfortable, maybe there's something about me that's quite annoying to them. they haven't been feeling the best and I tried my best to be supportive and check up on them, help in anyway I can, I'm sort of worried Im just annoying or burdening them.

 I truly do care and wish to help though, awhile ago they asked me for some space cause they weren't feeling well, I asked how long they needed and there were no more responses after that. I just left a long message supporting and wishing them well. I've asked some other people and they tell me I haven't really done anything wrong, all I did was try to be supportive and help even if at times I kept messeging to check up on them.

So I have asked them if perhaps there's something with me and they said no, that should be enough I guess but I still overthink it

I guess right now I'm super worried that they won't chat me back or talk to me again, I'm worried they'd forget to talk to me after awhile, I really badly wished I knew what to do I wanna fix things I wish I could talk but I know right now I'm not needed. I wish I understood more about everything but I don't.

It's important to mention I've got really bad abandonment issues, prior to this event a couple weeks ago I lost a friend and it tore me apart and made me feel terrible for so long. Something happened and it's nothing bad I guess but it made things awkward perhaps, they said it wasn't and I said I hoped we could still be friends and stuff, they just ended up ghosting me for a long time now. I'm worried this would happen again with my new friend 

The trauma and the worry is still very much there. I don't wanna lose them in scared of losing them, I really don't know what to do anymore. 
It's been a day, I don't know if they're feeling okay or not still but I doubt whatever they're going through is something that takes a short amount of time, i really am hoping they're alright, I'm worried abt them. I'll try not to but I can't help but worry it's so hard.

Some friends told me I should just wait for them to talk to me again or to chat, that seems logical but I don't know I'm really worried they'd forget about me and not talk to me again,or not wanna be around me again, I don't know how long I can take waiting I mean I'm not rushing them by all means but, I guess the wait is sort of making me think too much, I tried doing other things to help it's sort of hard.

Oh and I got like quizzes next week to study for and it's sort of hard to focus, I have so much schoolwork it's really drowning me. It's tough all of this is tough. I wish I knew what to do, does anyone know what I should do please?",1679709837.0
511,The death by a thousand cuts,"Welp.  I'm 43 years old now and...it's as tho I've been cut up so frequently over the years that I'm left a traumatized, cowering mess.  What in the fuck happened.

Things were going so great, too.  I've always struggled with depression and some anxiety, but after I moved on from middle school and entered high school, I seemed to flourish.  Had a great group of friends, a girlfriend, a wonderful sense of humor, an optimistic future.  Then I went to college and completely imploded.  Panic attacks.  Substance abuse.  Isolation.  Depression.  Hopelessness.

It's been that way for 25 years.  The problems my problems caused are innumerable.

I will say that, I did get sober around six years ago, but it's as if my problems became worse.

Now I live at home.  Barely leave the house.  Can't drive on the freeway due to severe panic attacks.  Am unemployed.  Unemployable.  Have no hobbies.  No interests.  Never feel joy.  Have completely lost my sex drive.  Am fatigued all the time.  Am strangely hungry at all times for no medically obvious reason.

It's like a slow burn towards a pitiful death.  All alone, back where I grew up.  Depressed as fuck.  Every day the same.  No end in sight.

Fuck.",1679691303.0

517,Advice and support greatly needed,"(26 year old female) sorry for the long post… I’ve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. I was always on 100 mg zoloft & then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often & have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol & very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg & after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg & started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety & panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I’m thinking it’s a medication issue or lack of something. I’m mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since I’m not doing well lol.

519,How to deal with depression without telling anyone?,"So, I'm not sure if this is depression or if I'm just being stupid or both, but I figure it's worth asking. I'm fairly confident my parents won't take me seriously, though I don't have any basis for that. So I cant talk to them about this. I just... can't bring myself to try in life. I've got a job(part time, though), I'm blessed will all sorts of things, like a girlfriend who never responds to my texts and rarely answers my calls, good food, a family who supports me, games, a home, etc.. And yet, I can't bring myself to try. I feel like it's pointless to try, that I'll fail anyways and somehow make my position worse. I know that I am capable of succeeding, and that I have all the tools I need to advance in my career and social position. But I just can't bring myself to try. I give up, fall into old habits, and now I'm just existing and waiting for even my parents to give up on me. I want to do better, but I just don't feel like I can, and i feel like it's pointless to even get out of bed in the morning sometimes.

529,Happy Late Birthday,"My boyfriend forgot my birthday, and even though I knew he would it still hurts. And on top of it he was irritable and kinda an asshole for a chunk of the day. Didn’t spend any time with me at all, just stayed in the bedroom smoking. He also scheduled for all of his cats to be vaccinated on my birthday and since he didn’t have money I had to pay for it. 

I went to go lay down with him the last half hour of the day and he was being nice and talking to me/ showing me things on Reddit. When midnight struck I said “happy late birthday to me.” He didn’t say anything until I looked up and he was kinda smiling and said he was sorry and that he forgot. I looked down because by then I just felt like crying. He wrapped his arms around me and said he felt like an asshole and kept saying he was sorry, that we could do something when he gets paid. 

But that’s the thing. I know that’s not true. As soon as he gets paid he’s gonna spend his money on drugs and other stupid things. He still hasn’t done anything for valentines, he couldn’t even write me a sweet note. And his excuse for valentines was, again, that he forgot and didn’t have money. He tried asking people for money to get me something. But…why is he asking other people for money to buy me something? Why can’t he just be considerate and think about me once in a while?

The drugs will come first every time. I know this. So why does it still hurt so much every time? Am I that unworthy to be loved and appreciated once in a while?

532,What’s the argument against suicide for those with clinical depression?,"Sorry if the title is off putting—it’s a genuine question I didn’t know how to word. 

So I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts lately, and weirdly I don’t feel scared to attempt, which is a first for me. I’ve struggled on and off with depression since I was 14, and with PTSD since I was 19. I’m 22 now, doing well for myself, have a great job lined up after graduation, people who care about me and am doing things I’m passionate about. I swear I’m not saying all that just to brag—I included it because I don’t present as what society generally pictures as a ‘depressed person’.

I’ve been browsing posts and articles about suicide, and the mantra I see repeated a lot is: “suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem” and people go on to cite how many problems of those contemplating suicide are fixable. 

My question is, what’s the argument for those suffering with chronic depression who have no ‘reason’ to be depressed? Those who are actively seeking help, trying to be healthy and make the effort to see the good in the world? I’m just a little sad all the time, and I can’t seem to feel joy barely at all anymore. I don’t know why. I think my brain is just ill. I’m trying meditations and just back into therapy but I’m scared I’m bound to be sick.",1679582242.0

534,Love of my life had emotional affair for a month,"As title suggests, my(29M) fiance(30f) of 8 years had some problems with her emotions after her grandmother passed and started feeling confused about being with me. At the beginning of February, she began an emotional affair with a person(36m) she met on Playstation. He gave her his number and they began texting and calling ALL THE TIME. Thousands of texts and minutes on the phone while I was away at work or while she was at work. It developed to the point where she had planned on meeting him (he lives in a different state) after breaking up and dropping our daughter off with me or her parents. They also engaged in phone sex at least once (I was at work, daughter was at school).

It all came to a head around 3 weeks after it began, and she said she didn't love me anymore. We talked for hours, about how we both felt, about what we should do, etc. I spiraled, and had some dark thoughts, which I told her about. She ended up staying because she didn't want me to kill myself, not because she loved me (i did not know this). She promised it was over with the other guy.

We tried getting past it, I was being a better person for her, talking more, being a better lover and I couldn't have been happier. She came around, and fell back in love, and confessed to have been talking to the other guy almost the whole time after she said it was done. What she meant was ""the romantic interest from me to him is done, I still want him as a friend"". I said it's him or me. So she ended it that day, no friends.

It was going decent afterwards, we've been going to therapy together, talking, and being more open to each other, but I can't seem to find love for anything at all anymore. It's like the world is gray, nothing tastes right, smells are bland, I have no positive feelings. It's terrifying me and I'm losing my sanity over this. I thought that messing with the other guy would help, but it didn't. I thought about revenge on her, but it wasn't something I wanted. Everything was going so good, then I just hit an emotional wall. I need advice please.",1679628030.0
535,dear depression,"dear depression. 

i understand that you feel lonely without me. i understand that you need me to stay with you so you can grow. i see that i get so much comfort from you. you have helped me understand others much more deeply and see others going through hard times too and you have helped me help others going through shit. but i have learned that your manipulations and gaslights don’t work a for my best interest. 
i can be so much more without you. i feel better, more positive and overall healthier when i don’t think about you. i feel for you, because being depressed is all you ever will know. but that is not what i want. i want to grow, move, care for myself and live life normally and i don’t want to have you in my life anymore. i am glad i met you because u taught me so much. 
u were always there when i went through hard times. u comforted me with binge eating, sleeping all time and feeling bad for myself but i need more from life. i can’t move forward and get better when i keep coming to you for comfort. 
i need to be away from you and i am done feeling like shit all the time for spending time with you. you will always be a part of me and i acknowledge that but i want you to stay in the past. moving forward i will do all i can to help myself even when you’re pulling me back. 

i am worth more that you can offer me. i can be much better person without you. of course i understand that you don’t want to let me go but i am telling you that i will keep on trying to stay away from you and i can find comfort in good things too. i don’t need you to keep me sleeping in bed all day. i don’t need you to comfort me with binge eating or not eating at all. 
i don’t want your problems in my life moving forward and there is so much more to myself without you. i won’t let you pull me into bad habits. i can overcome you and be a better person. 
i won’t let you be mean to close people around me. i won’t let you make me go weeks without showers. i won’t let you talk bad about me and my abilities. i can start living life to my fullest. 

i am so powerful without you pulling me down. i can do whatever i want when i put my mind to it and stay focused. i understand that this road is going to be tough as i will occasionally still miss you but that will not mean i want you to come back. i need you to leave me alone and i need to get away from you. and one day i will see how much better my life is when i finally let you go. you don’t bring good things to my life and having you as my comfort is toxic to myself and i no longer need it. i need healthier habits. i am going to bring joy to my life. small things will start making me happier. small things will be more meaningful to me because i get to enjoy those things without you and all by myself. all the good that life has to offer will help me more than you ever could. i do not need you to be my comfort place anymore. i am better than that. 
all that said, i appreciate what you have shown me and made me the way i am so that i could become even better. you will be in the past one day. and when you are in the past i will be so thankful i made it there alive. i do not want to die anymore and i will have the energy to take care of myself because i will not be fighting with you anymore, i will win. i am stronger than you think i am. this is not a final goodbye but one day it will be.

i think this time i will get really better and even if i fall back a little i still continue to move forward with fewer steps taken back. it is possible to recover and i will continue to want to be better. 

Love,
—

i made this post here because if it will help at even just one person it will be worth it. i wrote a letter to my depression, as a letter to a toxic friend that i am finally ready to let go and let myself get better. it gives me so much comfort reading this because when shits bad then it’s words like this for me that i need to understand because i keep forgetting why do i even want to be in a better place anyway. 


you all are so much more than your depression. depression will make you think like future without depression is impossible and way too hard, but it is not true. your depression will manipulate you into thinking that there is no help and no way to overcome it. it will obviously be hard, but think of all the times you wanted to get better and felt motivated. every time you feel good it is important to memorise those days that are good. it is so important to remember days where you felt better and did something healthy for yourself. we are all going through this and we can get better. even if you fall back, there will be days where you will want to be better again. do not give up.",1679604416.0

538,I have a mother addicted to sedative drugs and with psychological problems,"TL;DR: My mom is addicted to sedative medicaments who doesn't seem to want to get better, now she got a panic attack because my sister is moving out.

Hello everyone, right now I'm in need of some support, I already talked with my psychologist and some people of my family. I think I just need some support and comfort if you may...

I don't really know where to start, so I'll give a bigger look of my family and them focus in my mother.

I have a father, a sister and a mother living in the same house.

My father is a harsh man who has that old ""mainly"" personality that doesn't share emotions. He is insensitive, is impatient, talks loudly and is mad almost all the time. He doesn't understand emotions, and can't help me nor my mother. But he is a honest man.

My sister is a great friend and person, he is a little insecure with her looks and a bit anxious in a low level. We share many likes and I'm always wanting to be with her. She is a bit emontieless, which I envy in her, she tries to avoid emotional situations and is good holding her decisions. She is indeed a great person and will become the best of us.

My mother is the real problem... She is a retired teacher that has depression and enxiety, and she looks like someone who doesn't want to get better. She stop in the middle of every treatment she starts, she doesn't follow the receipts and sometimes auto medicate herself. She is addicted to sedative medication like alprazolam and headache medication. She is also a very dependent person who always try to get comfort from me and my father. As you have read, my father is not the best person to do that, so everything ends up with me having to take care of her. Most part of the day, my mother stays on bed, not because she is physically sick, but because there is nothing else she wants or can do, her main diet is bread with butter and coffee with milk. That life style brought to her many complications, she have intestinal problems, she is physically weak and has a lot of physicological problems. Looks like the stopped to live her life, and this is making me and my sister also stop to live ours. My sister is now going to move out for study, and although my mother tried to hold her gut, she had a panic attack, she refused to go to the hospital and to bring someone to our house to take a look on her. I talked to some people of my family and to my psychologist and both said that this was a way to call for attention, even if she is unaware of it. I feel so sad and mad with her for doing this to me, I grew with her caring for me and making me dependant of her, so I also have depression and anxiety because of my low self esteem and dependacy of others. Since her panic attack, I don't want to look at her for too long, I'm in the merge to collapse and cry, it's always me to have to help my mom, and she never gets better, there is nothing I can do, I'm lost, sad and mad.

544,"Searching for first ""Real Job""","Hey guys, 

Does anyone have advice or experience for finding a full time job after working in healthcare as a CNA? 

I have been pre-med my entire life, the biggest question was always human med or animal med. I graduated in 2019 w a BS in Biology, and started getting patient care experience as a CNA working 3x/12s in a nursing home, then at a hospital working overnights. Long story short, I have seen **a lot** the past few years. Honestly as much as I've always loved science, I can't deal with the politics around healthcare and how full of despair the entire system fills me with. We treat people like a transaction, don't staff units adequately purposely to cut costs, all the while increasing 'surveys' that get our managers fired instead of sharing very real concerns regarding patient load and staffing insecurity to anyone in charge of making the policies we follow. Employees and patients both lose right now. 

I just dont know what to do. I've always used school as an escape, and seeing that everyone in the real world seems not to give a fuck about the basic survival of the planet low-key is terrifying! After this, I have lost any trust that our government will be here for the people with other threats.

I stay home all day with the kids, he gets home from work and spends an hour alone upstairs doing god knows what and I am still stuck alone with the kids all the while. I have had thoughts in the past about getting in my car and just driving till the tank hits E, then getting out and walking until I can get somewhere I want to be. Tonight, I went to a concert in the city, and I had the time of my life. I was alone. Just me, no kids, no responsibilities. And seriously, when I say I had the fucking time of my life, i really mean that with my whole heart. And everything that the band I had longed to see since middle school had said outside of performing really resonated with me. Unfortunately, it has made the urge to get up and leave even stronger. I know I can't do this, but I feel like tonight I have hit my peak in life. I never thought I'd live to see the day I'd be able to do all of this on my own. I drank, and danced, and in between sets, I went outside and got caught frolicking in the rain like a fucking moron.

I'm trying to be more socially active, go outside, go to gym, try to learn something new every day but everything stays the same. Well, not exactly the same, because it just keeps getting harder.

I don't believe I'll be able to finish college, find love(I'm really bad at social interactions and meeting new people), find a job, and become happy. Every day it is only harder and harder to move on and deal with problems.

567,feel like my partner is no longer supportive with my anxiety. TW// i’m sorry i’m advance for the long ramble,"this is my first post and i’m sorry if it’s a little long and a bit here there everywhere….


my partner and i have been together for 9 months. due to housing and my mental health at the time, it was appropriate and decided i would move in with him for a little while. 

we’ve known each other previously for many years before we started dating and have always been super close. we’ve lived together for 5 months now and things seem to have gone pretty stale and i don’t know how to leave without causing upset. 

for the past month and and a half i’ve been suffering from a depressive episode with my bipolar. i haven’t brushed my hair in a month which is a usual occurrence when a depressive episode hits. my motivation for self care completely goes out the window and i stay in bed, endlessly scrolling through my phone while torturing my mind with memories of my shitty things that have happened- basically i fall in to a depressive hole. my partner completely understands this and use to be pretty supportive and helpful when i got like this- for example, he would help with getting the mattes out my hair and washing my hair when it gone unbearable, share a bath with me when showering was too hard. 

 recently i’ve been experiencing pretty bad night sweats where i wake up soaking the bed and my partner due to my anxiety. i also get pretty bad heart palpitations and start throwing up when it gets bad. my partner also suffers with mental health and anxiety attacks. today i got one and it got really shitty and wasn’t passing, (when i have panic attacks i don’t like reaching out for help as i feel a burden 99.9% off the time) i text my partner as we was on the game with his friends- he took his time to respond, as i started the message with ‘please dont rush but when you have a min’- because again i didn’t want to be a burden… he was sat 2 meters away from me with his back towards me. 

he came off his headset and sat next to me and asked if i was okay. i explained what was going on and it was almost like he wasn’t really there or taking in what i was saying. i kinda try and make light of situations because if it’s properly acknowledged i begin to cry and the anxiety attack gets worse (again my boyfriend has had pretty bad panic attacks in the past) i asked in the text message if he could sit in the back garden with me as i needed air to help me calm down, which i then asked to his face and he answered with ‘it’s raining’ (i love the rain/storms and lightening calms me and he’s always known this) it was almost like he was rushing to get back to his game… i pretended the heart palpitations had passed and i was okay and he asked for a kiss and rushed back to his game to plug his headset back in… while the silent panic attack got worse. 

my partner has experienced panic attacks pretty much the majority of his life, he suffered one not to long ago, where he sat with his head down the toilet and screamed his mum until she came up the stairs to assist (his panic attacks do get pretty bad) she came into our room and asked me if i had any ‘blades’ or ‘sharps’ she was going to take out the room to keep him safe- he’s always had his mum to help him calm down- where i didn’t have the best upbringing, my mum and step dad didn’t believe my mental health (even though it was diagnosed by doctors, they’d argue it with everyone) i never had a mum who’d sit with me until a panic attack or mental health break down would pass- i openly admit i am jealous of my partner and his relationship with his family. i grew up in a very toxic physically and emotionally abusive household and was kicked out at 17 years old. 

we never go out or do anything fun, the most we do is walk into town to my doctors appointments… we don’t go for food, drinks or any sort of dates, it doesn’t even have to involve spending money- i’ve made suggestions plenty of times but we make plans and it always falls through. 
all he does is play on his playstation while i sit it bed endlessly scrolling through my phone (which i 100% take the blame for and know is wrong but rn i can’t even leave the house with my episode) 

i decided to apply to study a degree with the open university which i got really excited about- i get excited over the smallest things and stupidly over share with my partner who always seems pretty disinterested and dismisses what i’m excited over… i’m hoping this will give me a little motivation and something to do and maybe help? 

this seems like such a ramble, i needed to vent this and if anyone could share any advice or their views i would really appreciate it.

It’s just her and I in the house, so when she talks about dark things and questioning life expecting me to have the answers and save her it takes a huge toll. I’ve told her to talk to someone and try to get help and try to take her out for fresh air to get her mind off things but she refuses to seek help. Her trying to rely on me instead of professional help is honestly taking me down too. I don’t know how to help her",1679496801.0

577,Advice for dental help,Hi so I've been struggling with depression since I was 12 and I'm now 23. For a while due to a mixture of my depression and anxiety around dental work (a dental assistant broke my tooth while cleaning) I really haven't been taking care of my teeth. However it recently got really bad. A few of my teeth are broken now and sometimes it makes it difficult to eat and im getting very self conscious which is making my depreasion worse so i want to start the process of fixing them. I wanted to know if anyone had any advice approaching a dentist about getting help for this and explaining the situation bc im so fearful they won't understand or they'll make me feel worse than I already do.,1679456012.0
578,I need some help,"My friend/roommate is trying to get me out tonight to go see an old sci-fi movie at a theater I like. She is trying so hard...it hurts because I don't feel like I'm trying enough and I'm not doing good enough or being a good enough friend to her. I'm honestly done with everything. It's been trainwreck after fucking trainwreck for 2+ weeks and seriously almost every day. Had to fire my counselor due to him out right ignoring a trigger and saying he only does 12 sessions and gave me more due to how I was struggling. So my trust in counselors is gone again and quite frankly worse. If you look at my profile you can see the medical stuff I've been enduring. 
I don't know if I can get myself to go, I'm not too big of fan of old sci-fi. She knows I like this theater. It's called 5th Element, I don't think I've seen it.
On top of everything else, I'm getting charged more for internet (cause they failed to inform I have to reapply for the credit I was getting when I moved) and I have to ask her for more money on top of everything -sigh- I'm just about done. 2+ weeks of daily trainwrecks is wearing on me.

I swore my life got better after quarantine and being to stay at home in my natural element and not worrying about anything but since then i just escalated again. everyday is becoming more and more worse.

582,Would I be stupid to ask my best friend that ghosted me to meet up?,"Well, I (28F) guess that since I haven't dealt with my emotions in a healthy way, I might as well put it on Reddit for the whole world to judge. Here we go
My story starts in high school. we met my first day of school. Here in my state, 9th grade was in the junior high at the time. The night before my first day, I was dumped. Quite a crappy way to start a new school. I walked into my TV broadcasting class, and there he was. The guy of my dreams. Let's call him Mike. We soon became casual friends. He got back with his ex, and that was the end of that, or so I had thought at the time. 
Fast forward a few years, and I had just graduated high school. Through high school him and I were just good friends. We had the same friend group. And I always thought he was attractive but had no feelings for him at this time. Well, until that is, I started to see someone new. Then I started questioning myself, and we were all hanging out late one night, so I decided just to put it out there with him and figure it out. I was rejected by him. For the first time of many. I was embarrassed but relieved that I could move on with a new guy. But don't worry, I blew that up to, so still no new relationship. (I spent all of high school single. There are a few dates here and there, but there is nothing of value) 
Okay, so fast forward a few more years. I have a child and am stuck in an abusive relationship. I was able to get myself and my son out of that situation. Here, I am in a healing phase, Mike, myself, and my at the time best friend were hanging out, and I went to the bathroom. Next thing you know, my friend is running upstairs freaking out that Mike confessed his feelings for me to her. Mind you, he was inebriated, and by the time my friend and I were spazzing out about it, he was passed out of the couch. So I go home and try to open the opportunity to talk and hang out more with him. He pulls back, kinda goes ghost, and I tell him I'm sorry, let's just keep things platonic. 
Okay, so here I am, dating  now, taking care of my son, working. I'm just all around kinda happy. My besty calls me over to hang out. And drunk Mike verbatim confesses, ""  I don't not like you,"" but again after this confession. Radio silence. It's this time that I realize he just wants to keep me on a shelf. I accept that I love this man, but I feel like I will never be good enough for him. I decided I care so much about him that I would rather be his friend and repress my feelings and emotions than risk the potential of losing him from my life forever. And I was okay with that.  
Over the years him and I grew closer and closer as friends.  Literally, I trusted him more than anyone. He had helped me heal my trauma from my bad ex. Again, with my feelings being hidden, I notice more likes on my profile pics, him texting, and just talking to me more. Finally, one day, I get the urge and dye my hair green(I like fun hair), and we hang out that night, and he is just gushing over me. Mind you, we went to a local bar, and he was totally sloshed. I knew it was bad news, but for some reason, I went searching for pain and hurt because once he started confessing his real love for me.  My response was, "" Say all this when you're sober,""
Well, needless to say, we shared our first kiss, and since he was beyond drunk, I drove him home. And we hung out for a little while, making out, i made him promise me to talk to me and not go ghost in the morning knowing his history.  He wanted to hang out with me the next day, but something came up. After that, I noticed the text messages stop. He stopped everything with me, and I haven't talked to him since. This was over a year ago, and I have tried everything to heal myself but can't seem to go a day without thinking about the love lost. Last night, I had another emotional breakdown and contemplated asking him if we could meet up and maybe get myself some closure, but also, I feel like it doesn't matter. He really doesn't care. But I care, and my feelings are valid. He was one of my best friends for over 10 years, and then he just.. Disappeared... 
So would I be stupid if I asked my best friend who ghosted me to meet up, or is it just beating a dead horse?",1679410721.0

584,Does anybody know how to relieve anxiety and depression?,"Hi everyone

it's my first time posting and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry if it sounds a bit  mumbly  and weird...

I have been battling depression for the past 15 years or so and I feel like I'm starting to lose now.  I'm not suicidal or anything but I feel like I mentally break down on the daily basis now

I have absolutely no energy for anything after I come back from work and it's at the point where I just dropped down on the couch turn on the TV and don't even have the energy to switch the channel to a show I actually enjoy watching or to play video games

I get the overwhelmed very easily and I almost get anxiety attacks when people text me. Whenever I receive a message my first thought is somebody's going to attack me, not because I did something wrong but I'm sure that they will be upset and they will be really mad and I'm just too scared to open the messages... have been asking me my SO to handle my messages for the past couple days 

My SO and I just moved to a new place and I thought it was just stress of the move and the fact that we kind of isolated ourselves from all of our friends because we were busy packing and unpacking but simple house chores like dishes or laundry just overwhelm me to the point where I'm not able to do them anymore not to mention not to mention vacuuming. 

Tonight, my SO is at a conference in a different city and I just spent 6 hours and the same position on the couch I couldn't even bring myself to grab dinner.

And they can't talk about it to anybody because I feel like I'm being a burden on everyone, just because they're my friends it doesn't mean that they have to babysit me every time I feel down, if anybody has any tips on getting out of this slump and taking back my life, I will really appreciate it

I just feel so down on the all the time and I'm not sure what to do because I don't have a great experience with therapists, I just never found one that was a good fit to me. It takes a lot of time to find the service even longer to find a good one it just feels like I don't have the time it will take ornamental capacity to actually call people whom I don't know and convince them that I am troubled and broken enough for them to find time for me in their schedules and I don't feel comfortable writing to my doctor and asking for drugs or medication or whatever you want to call it because I just see it as a Band-Aid for the problem...",1679433217.0
585,Stuck In The Middle - Feeling Hopeless,"i’m a 30 year old man, and i’m not doing bad but i’m not doing good. i spend lots of time alone. i’ve always had a deep love for music making, so most of my life i doubled down on that. but like a lot of realities, my success in that field is scarce. i work a decent remote job that is passionless sure but better off than anything else i’ve done, i help one of my favorite comedians on the side, i write music as a form of self expression when i can. currently living out of the office i do all my work from.

Often i’ll look at my life through a lens of self-doubt, less-than-thou and the existential dread regarding my trajectory in life. On top of that a cold blanket of loneliness with little love being exchanged around me.

There are a lot of things in my life I am not proud of/wish I had more energy to fix or improve but there are a lot of things I have in my life that some people aren’t so lucky to have. But the negative thoughts persist. Hopping back and forth between “look at these people, they’re doing so much better (or even the same) and they’re so much happier. Why am I not doing these things? Is this why they don’t like me/I have no friends)” and “I don’t deserve all these wonderful things I have. Someone else could’ve done a lot more with all the blessings I have.”

Life keeps going and I’m jogging behind it to keep up. I’m feeling tired, numb, random crying spurts, and angry at myself. How do I make this stop? How do I talk better to myself to keep me from sliding back into this? Are other people like this? Sometimes I wonder what normal productive people think throughout the day. Like when someone’s rude to them, when a problem arises, or at the end of the day, what do they think to themselves? Nice thoughts? Neutral? Idk this is probably also a rant.

He is weirdly lazy and never finish ANYTHING, no job is ever more than 90% done and you are not allowed to point out anything. It's his house and he is allowed to live however he likes and I'm thankful that I have a place to stay (I pay rent). But it's incredibly annoying that a grown man can't put his dishes in the washing machine and when I do it for him he says it makes him feel lazy. This is not the worst of it, he leaves heavy tools and at random places (like dinner table, sofa etc, and doesn't understand why I find it stressful to live in chaos). 

I've tried talking to him about a lot of these things but I don't know how to put this. He doesn't feel that there is anything wrong with living like this, I find it incredibly stressful and shameful.

596,Run fast for 30 sec,"There's a type of running that's called high intensity running. It just means you sprint for 30 seconds, for example. It might not sound like it to you, but this is a very powerful exercise. There is a lot of science behind it.

This might end your depression, if you haven't tried it before or haven't done it as a routine for long enough before.

If 30 sec is too much, do 5 sec or 10 sec. And then maybe set a timer for an hour, and do it again after an hour. You've now implemented exercise as a part of your life, high intensity exercise.

 Just doing this before or after breakfast, or before or after dinner or lunch for example, will make a difference in the lives of *some* of ya. Simple as that.

*High intensity running refers to a type of exercise where an individual performs short bursts of high-intensity running, typically lasting between 10-60 seconds, followed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. This type of training is often referred to as high-intensity interval training (HIIT).*

*The benefits of high intensity running include increased cardiovascular fitness, improved fat burning, and improved overall fitness. It is also an efficient form of exercise, as it can be completed in a relatively short amount of time while still providing significant health benefits.*",1679347162.0

I (F18, 6ft tall, unattractive, overweight) have been dealing with depression and anxiety all my life. Even though Im not diagnosed whatsoever Im pretty sure I have several mental illnesses including something neurodivergent like ADHD or Autism because my parents have always been overwhelmed by my behaviours or emotions. My parents or rather my mother are horrible people, they mentally and physically traumatized me bascially from the get-go. For example: My father broke my teeth while pushing me into a steel bedframe out of anger and my mother told me to die when I was 11 without reason. My mother always saw me as an extension of her reputation and public image and always yelled at me for my abnormal/childish behaviour. Ive also been bullied for like forever, even before Kindergarten I was the weird kid and it stayed like that till I graduated. I have never had any friends in my entire life until 7 years ago when I met my best friend, and she is kinda a red flag and toxic ngl, and about 3 years ago my other good friend and they are all I have.
Ive been thinking about unaliving for 6 years now but my friends, my pets and the fear of pain I have keep me from it. I have no motivation to do anything in life and I have an extreme apathy and hatred for people, which is ironic because Im currently working as a Caretaker for the disabled  (40h workweek and 515€ a month) because I was forced into it by my parents and my collegues told me I am not fit for this job. I am still living with my parents and they want to force me in another job immediately after my contract for this one ends. I dont want to do anything and I dont care if you see me as spoiled because of that I just want to make a lot of money either with an easy job or without working at all.

I had this crazy crush for so long and eventually, she told me the same. About a year in the making of being friends, we finally decided to maybe try a relationship about two weeks ago. However, after about a week together is when I was finally diagnosed with depression. We got drunk one night, and I spiraled something awful. I hadn't received my medication yet, so there was a lot of crying and probably being incoherent. 

This isn't an excuse, but I've never been in a relationship before, so I made a lot of pretty unfortunate mistakes. She is going through a lot right now, as am I, what with the whole recently being diagnosed thing, and I essentially dumped 23 years worth of unchecked and boiling emotion that I refused to acknowledge throughout my life. I know that isn't an excuse, whether I was drunk or not. But genuinely she has been the first person I have ever truly loved, I gave my virginity to her, for god's sake. I just wish I could go back. Take everything I said back. I don't even know what I said, just that there was a lot of crying.

I want to break down into tears. I want to scream. But I can't. I think I've gone catatonic. My body is on autopilot and my brain is crying out for help. I know it might be absurd to think that the first relationship I've ever been in that lasted a week is going to be with me forever. But my heart aches so much and I can't dig myself out of this hole.

I have tried to talk to him and have even sat with him even in the empty stairs on breaks but he seems so traumatized. I noticed a substitute once try to come to his aide but they didn’t care they called him names even with her standing there. I am at a loss and I am pretty new to this school I don’t understand why someone does not do something to help him I’ve told a couple teachers and nothing seems to have helped I honestly just don’t understand why. He has never said a word not even to me and I am always super nice to him, he even flinches if I touch him. He seems so scared, I am not Mr. Popular myself and I have no influence on others here. I have came to his aide also to try to stop the abuse but get caught in the crossfire myself so much to the point I was called a fag lover. But I can stand up for myself. It is not just verbal its also physical abuse nothing that can hurt him physically I don’t think but what I have witnessed is gum thrown in his hair, stuff thrown on him being spit on even stuff stolen from him. I am so at a loss and am scared for him.",1679299785.0
606,Unable to keep a job and I hate myself for it..,"Sorry this is so long 😭 omfg 

I’m 23 years old and I’ve been working off and on since I was 15 and now I can’t keep a job anywhere because working makes me so anxious and honestly scared but it’s mostly the constant noises coming from all around you. I have always had this huge pit in my stomach and this overwhelming feeling of loneliness and being empty. Honestly I’ve never been satisfied to be honest. I feel so useless and fucked up to the point where I just want to die and I almost don’t care how I die. I held my first job in my tiny hometown located in Tennessee as a cashier for an Ingles Market age 15 to 18 and since then I just can’t keep a job and I even had times when I worked at Ingles that they were going to fire me because I would have nervous meltdowns and run to the bathroom or the back of the store at just any random time and sometimes they weren’t even triggered by something and I would blow up on coworkers and my managers because apparently me going to the bathroom every two hours because I have two periods a month and sometimes I’ll even skip my period up to 6 months and I know I’m not pregnant because I had ovarian cysts horribly as a teenager and in my early teenage years and it gave me major scar tissue plus I was on Nuva Ring up until I had my tubes permanently removed once I turned 22. I have been fighting to get my tubes removed since I was 16 because I knew I could never be a good mother because in my mind I would hate my child. I feel like having children really ruins a lot of people’s lives I’m sorry but you guys are raising brain dead children who are hyper obsessed with their tablet and watching tv constantly. I’ve never had any sort of motherly instinct at all even as a child and I would never want to put any innocent baby in this world right now and especially knowing that their own mom hates them for simply existing and being here. I hated baby dolls especially the ones that made noise so instead my mom got me two pet birds and I miss them so much 💔 idk I know that was an extremely long story for nothing but LONG STORY SHORT : I hate my life and I’m still in the same town I grew up in and have experienced so much trauma here. No one will hire because I’m extremely unstable and suicidal. I can go through 4 different emotions all within 2 minutes for absolutely no reason EVEN AT WORK and ending on how much I hate myself for never succeeding in life no matter what it is. I didn’t even graduate high school.. I was so sheltered as a child and abused every day and I just can’t get rid of this empty feeling I’ve had since I was a child. I remember having my first suicidal thought at the age of 7 or 8.",1679280442.0

608,Should you tell a friend when you’re really suicidal?,"So I know that the obvious answer is technically “yes” because everyone always says to reach out but it feels more complicated than that. 

People also say that you really shouldn’t put things on your friends that are better left to professionals and I do see a professional but in all honesty the comfort of telling someone I know feels needed. 

But I think I’m also scared of it. I don’t want to put stress like that on any friend, I already know I bring people down just by existing. I’m scared that I’ll cry because I hate vulnerability and even though I really want to experience any kind of comfort, the idea of allowing that to happen feels terrifying. I feel like I’d never be able to look at them again or like who I am would change permanently. Mostly it’s just that it feels morally wrong to tell anyone though, I’d basically be telling someone that I had a self interrupted attempt and it doesn’t feel right to put that on anyone.",1679267802.0

612,A call for help and my story.,"Hey. Honestly, I don't know what I'm looking for. Peer support I guess. My biggest problem right now is my apartment. I have been locked to my couch for 3 months and everything has gone out of my control. I need to fix this asap or I will get evicted since neighbours have noticed everything is not right.


Im out of energy. I feel like Im doing all these things at the same time while in reality Im at my spot on my couch and do nothing. 

I thought it would get better. I lost my only person in the world last year. It was very tragic and a very bad situation all around. She was only 23 years old. We lived out of our home country and when she passed she had all my belongings with her. We werent married and there was no will so I was basically shit out of luck.

I was homeless with 2 cats. It was hard to couch surf and/or find a place to stay for one or two cats. Me, personally I didnt care if I was under the bridge or whatever but I couldnt provide for my little guys and it killed me.

My brothers have not called me a single time. My mom tries to help but I know she doesnt know what to do or say. Shes the only person I have had honestly, but I know its too much for her. The worst is I dont have anyone to share my day with or anything. I often find myself grabbing the phone to call someone only to realize that tere isnt anybody left.. Im so fucking lonely its killing me.

I went back to working after a few weeks after her death, got my kitties a paid place to stay. A cat hotel if you will. And I have worked hard ever since. I found an apartment and everything seemed to start calming down.

But depression quickly took over. I have not moved from my spot for few months now smoking weed, playing video games and gambling. I live with piles of garbage and shit and am over a month behind in rent. This needs to stop now and this is why Im typing this.  


I cant believe I let it get this bad..... I believe can still fix it if I just cand find the strength to do the biggest cleanup in my life and work extra shifts for missing rent. I really feel like Im starting to climb the Mt. Everest without any gear, but it's do or die at this point.

Tension at work makes me not want to go there. I have been on a paid vacation for a week and plan to go to a doctor to get time off to fix my depression.

Im really trying hard to get this place cleaned tonight taking baby steps to ""start over"". But this is such a huge mess and theres so much to fix that I feel so overwhelmed. Wish me luck.

Its hard to get professional help since I live out of my home country and I just needed to let this out somewhere. I know nobody truly cares but me, even if I do and thats ok. I have accepted that I cant get physical help and Im trying my best to so what is neccessary.

Please share how you got over similiar periods. Or did you clean your room/apartment? Did you go out today? Whatever baby steps you took today, please share. I need it right now.",1679259734.0

I look around and feel like I’m all alone when I’m surrounded by so many. I can’t help to think that I’m the reason of my families suffering. Nothing more than a burden I am insignificante in a world where all that matters is your significance. I am average beyond believe. I cause more bad than good and only get in the way.

I have meltdowns several times a day where I just sob uncontrollably. I feel guilty, like a failure, and bad about all aspects of myself. I feel hopeless and like life is without meaning.I find no pleasure in anything - not even music, something I am usually passionate about. Doing chores or self care is such a struggle.

I’m in my early 30s. I’ve been out of the trauma I experienced for longer than I was in it. I am reviewed by a psychiatrist every few months but have been getting steadily worse for a long time. 

I’ve been medicated, unmedicated, participated in ongoing long-term psychotherapy, supported myself as best I can socially & financially, engaged in healthy diet and exercise routine, yoga, sleep hygiene, breath work, arts, outdoors, less screen time… etc. 

This list isn’t fully formed but I feel I have tried my best to try for over 15 years to help, better & nurture myself on a lot of different fronts but I cannot shift or even minimally improve feeling so depressed and anxious all of the time.

I’m SO worn out and exhausted. 

I try to speak to psychiatry and they just want to give me more meds which have never really worked and I’ve have such bad side effects which over the years have really impacted my ability to do a lot of things. 

I have self harmed from a very young age and cannot stop wanting to hurt myself. For the past few years I’ve managed to do this less often but it’s constantly on my mind, and if I can sleep I then dream of hurting myself regularly. I still have “blips” and go back to self harm…and then the shame comes. 

I feel guilty even complaining - I’m in the uk and realise that even accessing mental health support seems to be a privilege. I work in mental health support and feel like an absolute fraud and imposter. I know life is effort and it’s hard for everyone but I can’t take much more of this and I’m getting into the headspace of “why should I?”

When I try to talk to people I am close to I feel worse - I’m so ashamed, embarrassed & guilty afterwards that I hurt myself or want to and use a lot of energy trying to not.

I can’t do this much longer, and the feeling that I just can’t cope with life gets bigger every day. I hate myself and am getting worse.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I was 8yrs old my parents and I immigrated to another country, so I went to primary school there and then secondary school. You know small town, it was nice. Had friends, and we knew everyone. I did well as a student at the start, was great at maths, etc.. but I don't know but somewhere along the way I got a little bit lazy ie. not doing homework and stuff. I quote my maths teacher ""You're a smart boy who enjoys being lazy"". Which looking back was true. It was like a yoyo effect, sometime I'd do it if I felt like it, and other times nah. My parents would always be after me to read books, I'll be honest my attention span couldn't go for more than 5 pages. I was sportive I guess, and played football any chance I got but sometime it would feel like it was hard to breathe chest pains like. Anxiety! Something that I found out about years later. went to y local gp, and she sent me to do scans and stuff but nothing was wrong. and nothing was said about anxiety. I think it was me worrying about my dad's job and the work permit depending on it, so it was like fear in the back of my head ig.

That was in limbo was a good 2 years. By the time I was 16yr old, finished my(o level) decent marks. around that time my dad's job visa was extended to 1yr, so till the end of the 4th year. 4th years always go on holiday but I couldn't go. They went to Italy. Right after the school year finished within a few weeks my dad's visa ended. He didn't an extension or other offers so we had to leave and go back to our home country. My mom had to leave her job as well. I had to leave behind a life with friends.

&#x200B;

So we go back to our home country. We had to live in the family house with my grandmother and my uncle. It was a fairly big house so we all fit in. My dad owned 50% of the house anyway so no one could say we couldn't stay there. A bit of background on my grand and uncle. My grandma didn't like my mom like at all. Hate would be a suitable word, she would tell my dad that my mom would be at other men or steal from her that kind of thing. She knows how to play my dad when her daughters need money which was a frequent thing even when we lived aboard. My uncle is the elders sibling, unmarried, and still looking for his Jennifer anniston or nothing. He was 50 at the time, fat, unlikeable, and a pervy prick. 

&#x200B;

So when we got back to my home country I had to find a school through the ministry of education, We presented my certificates, letters, and grades. I had already done my O level equivalent aboard but the Education board here just look at it and said we are putting me in 3rd year secondary school and that I would have to redo my o level in years(the 5th year). So I would be losing 2 years. My dad agreed to it because of pressure from his brother saying it would be fine, so my dad didn't say anything, returning to his old pattern. So I went back to school as a 3rd year. It was weird and difficult to fit in as I spoke English my whole life and now I had to speak a different language. The jokes and culture were different. I mean I tried, I really truly wanted to fit in but either I began to feel like an outsider in my own country. On top of that in school I got subjects like chemistry, biology, Eco, and Accounting. Subjects I haven't touched since 1 year of secondary school. So I was expected to pick up new subs and get a passing grade within a few months to move up a grade for the next school year. That's when fear/ depression started. Crying alone in my bedroom. Was told multiple times to suck it up. I was stressed, and on top of that, I could hear/see the manipulation around me. My gran kept planting seeds in my dad's head, and naturally, fights began. I remember seeing that bitch smile when my dad started accusing my mom. She properly enjoyed it. She didn't think anyone noticed but I did. She tried the same tactic with me, giving me money, and attention but when she was called out on it, she began telling me she would enjoy me getting a new stepmother. The joy she would have kicking my mom out. So me being the little shit I am, I began recording her knowing my dad would never believe me otherwise. Showed my dad the recording and videos but nothing he said his mother would do that. But after a while, I think he notices her ways. So he stopped being close. At that point, I was a few days from turning 18yrs old. So I decided I wanted to leave school as I had my O-level and do it as a private candidate for my A-Levels. My parents were behind me for it. The other not so much but I didn't care. I signed up for it and left the school system. I did private tutors for my subjects, which I thought was a good idea since at school I was stuck with shitty subjects, whereas I could choose the subs I was good at. At this point, I stopped speaking at all to my uncle as he would start fights. He didn't believe in the private exam paid for a level. He only believed in the school system. So he'd punch my door, turn off the internet, and stuff. I remember him telling my dad that I would be a disappointment in the future, I would make my parents cry. I would never be able to look at myself in the mirror hating myself etc. I was never going to pass, Why even bother with this as I would fail again and again? 

&#x200B;

At the start, I studied full force but as the fights and words kept coming, I think got to me. I studied less and less. Started skipping tuition. Drinking alone. In my head, I was like ""I gonna fail anyway"" so might as well. So by the end of the year, I did the exam and within a month or so, got the result I failed badly(Ungraded) on three subjects and got a pass on maths. My parents didn't shout and rinse me, they just said to take a few weeks off. then study hard for the next year, try again son. It happens, we all fail. But at this point failing got in my head. Was very depressed, though I didn't show it, I was. My hand started shaking in anxiety, I would black out sometimes randomly. I remember I felt my heart beating, a butterfly in my stomach then I blacked out and fell for a few mins in a supermarket. Still failed the 2nd time. and 3rd. At this point, we moved out of that house and into a small rented apartment. Each year I said I will do better and stuff. Exercise and get fit but never do. Every year. I got a job at Techworld for 2yrs then lost it during COVID. Now I'm 26yrs old. Still ever crushed by fear and depression. Stuck. no friends no life. The one or two friends I had during my 18/19 went to uni, and stopped hanging out. Now they have jobs and new friends. I'm honestly embarrassed with myself. I don't look at myself in the mirror. I don't know where to go from here. I feel like I'm still that kid at 16yr. ANY WORDS OF ADVICE? I understand if you judge me, I am a loser.",1679253979.0

628,It's extremely hard for me to get out of bed in the morning,"I waste most of my day literally just laying in bed and I hate it. 

Let's say I wake up at 9AM, I probably won't turn my light on and actually get up until 2 or 3 PM. And it's really effecting my life at this point. 

When I wake up I have literally zero desire to get up and do anything. I'll lay in bed thinking about the fact that I have chores, I need to eat, I want to watch a movie, etc. but I just feel like I can't do it. I'll lay there and do nothing. I'm not on my phone or reading or watching TV. I'm just laying in a dark room, with my eyes closed, doing literally nothing at all. It looks like I'm sleeping but I'm usually fully awake, sometimes I'll doze off back to sleep. 

But the issue isn't being tired or needing more sleep. It's just that I have *zero* motivation to... be alive, I guess. 

It's so hard to feel the need to get up or do anything. I know I'm depressed, but this is just created some cycle and making it even worse. 

It's wasting all my time and making simple things like taking a shower feel like the end of the world, since I already woke up so late and it uses up so much time. I always regret not getting up earlier immediately after I force myself to get up, but then I do it again the next day.

629,Recovering from anti-depressants,"I was on and off on different types of anti-depressants for around 10 years. Some of them helped for a week or two but after that I felt worse. So I was prescribed higher doses and combinations. I think the story is familiar to many. It's been 10 years now since I decided that I'm not gonna touch any of those ever again.

Before that time period I was a very calm and stable person. I was very tolerant to pretty much anything in life, e.g. I didn't understand why someone would get irritated of another person, queueing, traffic, you name it. 

But I was a bit lost and lacking the feeling of purpose in life so I made the crucial mistake and went to see a professional. And another mistake was to trust all those doctors without doing any own research.

To my question then. Has any of you been able to recover from a longer use of anti-depressants?

I'm not the same person anymore. I get mood swings (short term and long term), I get irritated extremely easily, I'm impatient and have difficulties concentrating. I cry easily, I give up after any hardship, big or small, I have memory issues. 

All the emotions in general are now too overwhelming, when I had pets the love felt painful and not pleasant, and I might start crying endlessly for being so grateful for having a home, enough food and a priviledge to live in a safe country. Due to this I can't listen to music, it's too much to handle. And when I start laughing on some funny thing it's difficult for me to stop.

To me these symptoms are related to damage in brain. People that suffer from brain damage after an accident are many times with similar symptoms. And people are telling me that ""you nowadays act like my father after he had a stroke"".

That scares me. Has anyone suffered from this type of change in personality after medication, and if so, have you found anything that helps?",1679210154.0

634,I need help please,"I've made a post like this before and I'm back because it's worse, I'm going to keep this shorter then my other post because I just don't want to remember it but your free to go read it. In a short my mother is a very gaslighting, my way or the highway kind of person. She'll make you feel like shit just to get her way, she'll make you terrified of her just to get her way. She's always throwing harsh insults at me. She used to hit me until I was bruised but she stopped but I don't want to grow up looking down at my arms remembering where bruises and self harm marks were. I'm so tired it's not something I can take anymore it's not. I pray that God takes me away everyday. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends and I'm not allowed to leave the house. I'm not allowed to talk to any family apart from who's in the house. Which is only my mother father and sister. They've always been so much nicer to my sister. There's always been moments where she has not respect for anyone or anything yet my parents just let her be. She'll say stuff like I don't love you to my mother. She'll drop drinks and glasses and through all of this she won't get yelled at. My father is always busy if it comes to me. He's like a stranger in my house at this point. I feel like he doesn't even know me. My sister being as spoilt as she is purposely gets me in trouble sometimes. If I were to even drop a little bit of water my mother would tell me how annoying and worthless I am. She does it in such a toxic way She'll say it in an indirect way so that if I ever bring it up she'll say l never said that. Like when I was younger she hit me so hard and said she couldn't care about me unless I was passed out on the ground. I brought it up and told her she didn't care about me unless I was dying and that she said that herself but she just said she never said that but she did. I always hear people saying they have a mother or father like mine and that they understand but they don't. They're no being homeschooled by that toxic women. Their not taking tests under her watch. Your not staying in the house 24/7 with her. It's not like you don't see your cousins. I'm so tired of people telling me they understand but they don't and they always say that I am just being ungrateful or dramatic. I've done school from 7am -3am because my mother broke a glass and was in a bad mood. I was only 7. I ended up with so many harsh words and bruises that night.  I'm so tired I know people are going to say it'll get better.  I can't wait for it to get better its been like this since I was 7 I wanted to end it all at 8 I've done self harm at 10 and attempted at 10. I'm 13 and I still suffering I can't call cps cus I don't want them to get in trouble, but I can't keep living like this. I don't know what to do it's so tiring I just want to quit idc if it'll get better I'm not waiting until 18 or 19 to move. I don't want to grow up with all of this trauma I just want out. I don't want to talk to them about it they won't understand. They don't care either. My mother has done alot for me such has convince my dad to get me and my sister phones and playstations. But money and expensive things can't make me forget and it can't make me forgive. It can't make me happier. It not like we have a big house or alot of expensive things.

So I noticed lately that I’m struggling with finding motivation for pretty much anything. I don’t really enjoy my job anymore, goin out with friends, the games I used to play, I don’t wanna do anything at all. All I wanna do it lay in bed and do nothing because I don’t have the motivation or energy to get out of bed. And change scares me more and more. I don’t like it and I don’t want it. I just bought a car(my first) and I’m really proud of that but I can’t shake the thought that when I get out and walk away that I forgot something, E-brake or windows or doors not locked.

636,How to push through a tough low day?,"Having a very low day that I can't push past or through like I normally can and could use some more tactics to try that have worked for you all. I normally have low days 5-6 times a week, but today has been extremely taxing and just so hard to push through it all. (instead of curling up in a ball in my bedroom while ignoring all my responsibilities)

So far I have made myself workout this morning, shower, talk to my spouse one on one, play with my son, interact with my dogs, focus on what I'm grateful for, breathing techniques, viewing my life and situation pragmatically/logically, and acknowledging my emotions/self compassion. 

I feel like I am sabotaging my own weekend and slowly eroding away my husband's happiness by being like this. I can honestly see it being exhausting to just be around someone who can't ""get over it"" or ""past it"". I have a son who will eventually be old enough to see through my mask on days like these and that breaks my heart to think about.

638,Angsty post from an old man,"So, first time poster of something like this. Forgive me in advance. Sort of a throwaway 

I've been struggling with depression for almost 20 years. It comes and goes, ebbs and flows, but it's been there in the background the whole time. I've taken different medications (Wellbutrin, Zoloft, lamictil) with varying levels of success. In fact I've taken Wellbutrin on a pretty regular basis since my early 20's with moderate success. 

Over the last five years though, it's effectiveness has diminished: It still does something for me, but far, far less than it did before. 

But it's hard to notice that happen, slowly, from the inside.  Like the proverbial frog being boiled alive, I never noticed the change, or was too unaware and slow to pick up on them. My racing mind too sluggish to perceive. 

Things that used to interest me, hobbies I once loved, and still desperately want to participate in are out of reach, too much of a task to take on. paying attention long enough to finish more than a few pages of a book seems impossible. The things I like to do became the things I used to do. Slowly slipping away

Once the calm, collected person with my romantic partners, I now found myself angry and lashing out. Withholding kindness and affection to one who so desperately just wanted us to be happy together. I instead blame my behavior, my anger on her and continue to lash out. 

Friends start to notice changes. I reach out less and less. I'm not engaging with them on things that we have in common. They notice I'm not really working on the things that used to interest me.  I rely on them to engage and to keep the relationship going. A voicemail I left causes a friend to text back almost immediately ""You don't sound like yourself. Are you ok?"" I return the text with a lie, telling him I'm great. 

Day to day tasks become more difficult. I am able to work, but executive function there and elsewhere suffer. Remembering to pay a bill becomes almost impossible, and actually going through with paying it, well, that'll take me all week

I drink more and more. Never before or at work, but regularly before 5pm. It slows the racing thoughts in my head. Quiets my mind. Almost let's me enjoy the moment.  Let's me feel something else for a bit. 

The relationship ends. My lashing out and other unhealthy behaviors finally became too much for her. I did things behind her back that, while not cheating, were definitely dishonest. 

Where I used to blame her, I see she was in the right. I see the harm I caused to our life together and to her as a person. I accept the blame. 

So now I find myself alone. Trying to take some of the advice I was given in my in the now-ended relationship. 

I have stopped drinking. So have at least made that change. That just leaves me more time with the racing thoughts.

Trying to find a therapist who works for me. I've seen a few over the years, even recently, but have never made a good connection with one. One who I trust to help figure me out. 

Finding a psychiatrist to fiddle with my medication. But it's taking so long. ""Try this for six weeks. We will see how you feel then"" when I don't know if I can spend another six days feeling this way. 

On top of that, neither of those services or medication are cheap, so that's an added stress.

I know this all sounds mighty angsty. I'm almost 40 and in some ways never stopped feeling  as I did when I was a teen. As though I haven't developed at all since then. 

To top it all off, I feel slightly guilty for having all of these problems. I'm a cis-(mostly)hetero white male with what should be a good and easy life, if I'd stop messing it up. I shouldn't have any of these problems. And even if I do, I should keep them to myself, as the world is much more harsh on most of its inhabitants

I find myself alone without much of a support network around me, due mostly to my withdrawn behavior as the depression got worse

What do I do here?  How do I move forward? This seems like boilerplate depression. There has to be a simple fix",1679188480.0
639,"I need help, I’m out of energy","Hi. 
I have a history of depressive episodes and this past year has been the worst of my life. I know everyone reading this is going through stuff too, but for those that have made it through hard times.. how the hell did you do it?
I had a toxic relationship that I left last month and I don’t feel heartbroken over it, I just kinda miss her at times but I moved out of town for a transitional period so I can figure out where I want to settle down. I thought this would be a good option and now everyday I spend in my home with my dog and I feel bad for her because I don’t do anything. But she seems to be okay with it thankfully. But I have no energy to keep up with any of my old hobbies. My past self would be disappointed. I quit my line of work because I can’t stand the shitty people that belong in it. I was starting to become a piece of shit myself before I left. But now I sit here feeling disappointed because I am working a minimum wage job and do nothing else with my life while in the past I was making more money than anyone my age and I still did shit on my own time
When will this end man.. it’s lonely and sad as hell. I hope this wasn’t too confusing. I’m honestly just ranting. Take care of yourselves, people",1679169545.0

641,Not sure what to do.,"I'm not sure where to start. I've been deeply depressed my whole life, but the past year has absolutely destroyed me like none other. I found out I was pregnant in December of 2021 by the man who had been mentally and verbally abusing me for the past year. I'm 22 years old and we share a 6 year age gap, so he had other children by another woman which never bothered me, except he did not care about my pregnancy because he had already done this three times with the mother of his other children. I debated on aborting the pregnancy for about two weeks after finding out but I just couldn't, the guilt was so horrible that I couldn't eat or sleep. It was all I thought about. I spent my birthday alone the following month, he didn't even buy me a card. My parents took me out to dinner which made the day better, but it was so disappointing coming home to nothing from the man I was having a baby with. Not even a happy birthday. Weeks later, my dad had a heart attack and had open heart surgery. You can imagine the stress and anxiety was through the roof. It was horrible. In February of 2022 I found out he had been cheating on me for the past 3 months and had even taken the woman to a sex club where they had unprotected sex, putting me and the baby at risk for so many STD's..That night we argued, he hit me, pulled me by my hair, dragged me, and slammed the door on my chest and pregnant belly, then threw all of my stuff outside. I made the mistake of staying. He cheated the entire rest of my pregnancy. I worked all 9 months, 11 hour days in fast food, bought everything my daughter needed completely alone, and took care of his 3 children on my maternity leave AND with a newborn. All at 21 years old..

On Father's Day he gave me covid which he got from a night out at clubs with other women. I was 30 weeks pregnant, miserable, suicidal, and exhausted. While being quarantined together I found two other women in his phone. I made him pay for a full STD screening that day. $800. He continued to cheat on me up until I gave birth and even 2 days postpartum. It never ended. I finally moved out of his house and into my grandma's when my daughter was 3 weeks old after he threatened to choke me while holding her. I remember before leaving I would spend hours crying on the bathroom floor while him and my daughter slept. I hated life, I didn't know if I loved my daughter, I wanted to die. Now that I live with my grandma I feel somewhat better, not happy but better. I'm able to work and get breaks. Before moving in I would sit in bed with the baby for 12 hours waiting for her father to come home so I could shower or use the restroom. I never got breaks. As expected he cheated a few weeks after I left, then on Thanksgiving after spending the day with my family and I. 

No, we are not together now. If you've read this far, I'm sure you're relieved to hear that. But how do I stop this feeling? I hate life, I genuinely do. I have a hard time showering, brushing my teeth, cleaning, sometimes taking care of my 6 month old daughter, everything. Is it wrong to wonder if I have PTSD from all of the cheating and trauma from the past year? I'm just so unhappy. I don't know what to do. I have no friends, no hobbies, nothing but me and my daughter who I do EVERYTHING for. I can say the only thing I am proud of myself for is how responsible I am with her, how she never runs out of formula, has diapers, wipes, clothes, everything. She is well taken care of despite me being suicidal this past year and I've managed to do all of this while hating life. But what about me? Where do I start? I'm open to advice, criticism, help, friendship, anything. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I just needed to vent. I'm so alone. Thank you.",1679160767.0

I’m also going to attempt social media posts— but it’s not my forte. I have ordered some basic recording equipment and I hoping the quality of the equipment outshines my lack of perspective 🤣.

I guess it all started last year when I moved back from college, I was starting to get my life together, found a job, bought myself a car. Then the chaos started happening. My dog passed away, my parents were on the verge of getting divorced, and my dad has a drug addiction that makes him travel to a whole different city to get his drugs and takes my car (my parents don’t have reliable transportation because he spends all their money). My parents were basically feeding the drama that was happening between them to me and just talking bad about each other to me constantly. Fast forward to now my parents are still miserable together, I forcefully had to set boundaries with them because I do not want to be an enabler and basically cut them off. I’ve had conversations with both of them about how I felt and to me it seems like they don’t care. A few weeks ago was the anniversary of my dog’s passing and honestly I feel devastated still.

I try to have a positive attitude but it doesn’t last long idk if I have anger issues or if it’s depression. My boyfriend thinks I’m depressed but idk.

650,Addicted to sadness,"Hey, how's it going? 

Since I  (F20) was a child I remember feeling empty. Never have been diagnosed with depression as such, but I do see symptoms of it as a consequence of my generalized anxiety. This past few months after 4 years of therapy, I'm taking meds (Sertraline, Zoloft) and honestly, it has helped. A lot. However, I kinda feel like I've lost a part of me. 

Being depressed made my 'inner world' bigger and more interesting (if that makes any sense). It seems like I've left behind a part of me that was more creative, contemplative, and much more. For example, before my meds I used to draw as a form of self-expression, but slowly, I stopped because of lack of creativity, time, motivation, etc. I fear that as I become happier, I also become more boring, shallow.

I really think I'm obsessed with being sad, and I don't know how to stop romanticizing my personality when I was depressed. I know it's wrong, but unconsciously, I have this idea that i can't be truly myself without being sad. I have lived in an obscure world for so long that i've made myself comfortable on it. 

i've already talked about this with my psychologyst, however she sees all of this as rumiation, which I agree, but whatever she says to me only gives me short term relief, or doesn't help at all. This feeling always manages to come back.

654,"Everyone hates me, but is too afraid to say it.","I have no one to talk to, sorry if this all seems random and unrelated, I just need to get it off my chest. I'll probably make a lot of typos.

I got out of partial hospitalization about a year ago, I told myself that it was the start of a new era, that things would be better from now on, and that the worst of my mental problems were behind me, I was wrong. In the past year, I've made very little progress, if anything I've become even more of a basketcase.

I just can't shake the feeling that most, if not all, people in my life are just tolerating me. That every time some ones nice to me, they either pity me, are just humoring me, or feel like they're obligated to, even if they don't truly want to do it. My family is *still* paying off the medical bills from PHP, and they keep saying they don't mind because they think it was important for me to go, but I know they're lieing to me. Why? Because they know I'm an out of controll mess and don't want to deal with me being overly emotional right now.

I know this is true. Recently my dad lost his job, soon he'll be lossing his insurance too. My family keeps acting like this is no big deal. I told my family I was worried about this, and they told be that me ""freaking-out"" was more anxiety inducing than him losing his job, and that I was ""overreacting"" and me not calming down ment that I ""didn't trust them \[my family\]"".

The point is that I've failed. I wasted by family thousands of dollars on something that appernely didn't work, and now we're not going to have any money or insurance. I am a leech on this family and there's nothing I can do about it.

Recently, I started a new job. I know my boss and coworkers think I'm wierd. I don't think they nessisarily dislike me, but they diffentatly see through my facade of professionalism. I know the only reason I was hired was because they were understaffed, my boss must know by now that I'm underqualified and undeserving of the job. A few days ago my boss sent me an email asking how I was adjusting to the job, and if I feel comfortable to work a shift alone. I genuinely have no idea how to answer her. Honestly, taking several days to reply in itself is probably enough to prove to her that I'm unprofessional. If I tell her I'm nervous about working a shift alone, she'll see how incompetant and slow of a learner I am, if I tell her it's okay, I'll have to work alone and will likely fuck up if somethings only left to my judgment. There's an employee luncheon comming up. My family thinks I should go, but I know my coworkers don't want me there. I know I'll ruin everything.

Because of my families lack of funds, I've had to start seeing my therapist less. Being the basket case that I am, this is fucking killing me. I can't be alone with my thoughts for too long, and I know there is no one else I can talk to.

I can't even talk to my friends or family. I know if I tell my parents too much they'll get worried, I can't tell my younger siblings because I'm older than them and it's not their job to solve adults problems. I haven't talked to most of my ""friends"" since Halloween. Of my irl friends, One of them I just don't have the mental energy to talk to anymore, and the other seems to be uniterested in talking to me. Knowing me, I wouldn't be suprised if I'm ruining her day by just talking to her, and she only agrees to hang out with me out of pity because she knows she's basically my only friend right now. Of my online friends, I know how much more awkward I am compared to the rest of them. I know they only tolerate me. Honestly, I think I'm a danger to most people around me. I take a lot (mentally, emotionally, phyically, monetarily) and give back very little. I had a dream last night about hurting one of my friends. I know I'd never want to actually do that to them, but I can't bring myself to even message them, because I worry that somehow I'll still hurt them. I've had intrusive thoughts in the past about my friends. I know it's safer for me to just stay away from them. They don't know how much danger they're in, and I know I can't tell them without making things worse.

Everytime I talk about this with my therapist, she asks for ""proof"" of people in my life not liking me. I know she's doing this as a CBT exercise, not out of malice, but I wish she would just trust me on this. I know they hate me. I know they're sucking up to be for their own benifet. 

I think what makes it worse is no matter how hard I try to be a better person, to make people like me more, it never works. Eventrually I just slip back into my old ways. Everyone around me keeps telling me it's okay, but I know it's not. No matter what I do, I am still who I am at my core. Hell, I know at least one person will probably comment on this post saying something like ""You're not bad!"" or ""Even good people do bad things, it's okay to mess up sometimes!"" SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!!!! You don't fucking know me! To you, I'm just another throwaway account. You don't know how pathetic and disgusting I am in real life. I'm not just a good person who messes up sometimes, I constantly mess up and never learn from my mistakes. I am a burdon to everyone around me, and I know I can't talk to anyone. At least on reddit, people can just block and mute me if they don't like me, there's no exceptation to pity or suck up to me. I know anyone who interacts with my posts are doing it because they truly want to. I am doing my friends and family a favor by not venting to them about this, because I know it'd be too much for them.

My therapist told me to try to find a way to get out more, make new friends, but now matter where I go, I know I'll stick out like a sore thumb, I always fucking do. I just can't mask my emotions no matter how well I try. Even just in random public places like public transit or the grossery store, I know everyone around me can still there's something wrong with me. I know I'm a spectacle.

Even aside from all of this, I don't have any real goals in life, other than to just keep my job for as long as possible. I can't go back to college, I don't have any talents or skills that anyone else couldn't learn in a week at most. It's especally hard watching my siblings get accepted to big universities and have real goals and friends, when I basically just sit at home all day.

I just feel so defeated, I have no idea what to do. All I want is some real support, not from someone who I paid or someone who pitys me, but someone who genuinely cares about me.",1679089544.0
655,Is there a way back from depression? Please I need help,"Not too long ago I was a joyful girl who didn't take things personal and could move on from almost anything, but now joy is temporary and there is this profound sorrow that is always lurking. 

When I have a beautiful time and I smile or laughed reminiscing at it, I then feel the area of my heart tightening, then I start to cry.

When the good is temporary and the bad so constant, I can't hep but wonder what's the point of living. Nothing lasts, people take advantage of you when you are at your most vulnerable, and if you come from a broken family who abuse and can't stand each other, there is no place to call home.

After some experiences, my belief system has changed and my logic, my rationale, doesn't allow me to be happy and liberate myself from the past as it used to.  

I feel so broken inside and so alone even when surrounded by other people, that the only thought that  brings me consolation is that I will die. 

When I realise that I have 2/3 of my life to live, I can't help but feel a profound desperation.

I've done different therapies, probably spent around 5k on it. I read every book I can find on neuroscience, depression, relationships and so on. 

I know that the reason why I'm depressed is because I feel so alone in life, and anything that makes my heart beat, is unreachable (having a happy family, or at least a mom or a dad that are there for me and understand me, compassionately) or nonsense (having a dog, which is too expensive and limits your life options {rent, travelling}, etc, and I find it even abusive towards animals).

I've been living in a country different to my own for almost 7 years and now that I was going back to my home country to live with my grandmother, who is the only person that gives me that somewhat safe, warm feeling, my brother is divorcing and moving to hers. And my grandmother always puts my brother first, so. 

I also don't know where to live as where most of my friends live, life is too expensive and I don't want that lifestyle. 

I truly need help, I don't see a way out. I don't think I can hold on to life for much longer. It hurst too much.",1679079148.0

658,The difference between your depressed self and your not-so-depressed self!,"Hi!

This is a post to understand the changes I have noticed over time as my meds start working. 

Now some context. I have history of depression now over a decade. It entered the most extreme face around 2021, which is when I decided to take help. After more than a years of know response to any meds and switching my doctor I am in a pretty good phase now for almost 6-7 months. But this phase was not easy because I literally went through the phase where you can feel your fever is going down but you are extremely weak. And also now I feel like certain things are switched off (by the meds I guess!) like anxiety or stress which I can feel even if I have a deadline tomorrow. This also has given me a sneak pic of my own behaviour, actions and responses to the world. 

Look I am not completely out of it. And many of things has not come back yet, like physical attractions. When I told my doctor about this in my last visit he said that's completely fine because my brain has been completely ransacked by my depression so it will take to get back to a normal state. So I have wait and hold on a little longer and meanwhile get back to life.

And when I say getting back to my life I realised not only physical attraction, or menstrual cycle or appetite but there are small things that I do not find any interest anymore. Like photography. I am not a good photographer but I used take photos of scenery and when I am down I would feel somehow lifted by just taking a just a perfect shot. Or taking a selfie. I will try to take at least one photo if I go out or sometimes just take one good one to change my mood. And now I do not. Last photos of me are when I was extremely depressed and was looking a way to feel something. And now I can't even associate myself to that time.

I think the biggest one is my passive and aggressive self. So I am introverted but also if I want or need something I will never hesitate to speak up. If I feel the need to intervene or call out someone I will do that upright. So people who knows me are always conscious about me being such an ""hot-head"". However as I entered that depressed self couple of years ago I kind of pulled away from the world and get in a phase where everything is seemed pointless; like what's the point of getting ready in the morning for rest of our lives to just go through a bullshit job. And the people I met that time, or the friends I made or the relationship I had, they kind of thought I am like this passive nice soft-spoken person. But whenever that 'me' would get out of the closet or now when I am getting back on my feet I see people complaining about why I have changed so much or what happened to that nice person or how and why I am mad on small small things. It amuses often tbh. That they took my nice behavior as something to be taken granted for.

Anyway do everyone who went through the same journey have same experience? Do you feel the dissociation between your two phases?",1679069498.0

662,can you relapse back into depression,"Right I'm 25 female. I've been clinically depressed before been sucidial, attempted all that shit. I've recently been really good I'd say the last 2 years I've been really happy. Finished uni, got a job in my career field, plans for the future house, good friends, good relationship.
But recently there's been 2 suicides of people similar in age to me in the local area. It's bringing up feelings I don't want to have. I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but I can feel the depressive thoughts creeping back. 
My boyfriend and friends knew these people in a passing sense. Is it selfish if I ask them not to talk about it in my presence? I don't really want to go back to therapy because as stupid as it sounds I'm saving money and work is crazy and I don't have time for it (yes proitising work over mental health isn't great). I just want to know has anyone had this happen before and is it more of a passing thing or will this be a trigger?

664,Tired of everything.,"I’m not diagnosed with depression or anything, but I’m honestly so tired, mentally, physically and emotionally. Idk what’s wrong with me anymore. I honestly feel like giving up. I can’t think straight and don’t have the energy/effort to do anything anymore. I’m constantly overthinking about life. 

I lost the pleasure of living my life. I wake up and wish I didn’t. I go to school and I feel like at any moment I would breakdown. I hate school and I hate life. I don’t enjoy the things I used to do, like sports, cooking, hanging out with friends or even watching movies. I feel like the life has been sucked out of me. That’s why I love sleeping. It gives me an escape from reality so I don’t have to deal with whatever is going on with me.

I’m trying so hard to be better by trying new things (hobbies), faking a smile and laughing more, but I keep getting knocked back. It’s been a constant feeling for the past few years, and it’s only gotten worse. Im starting to hate everyone around me even more and just want to be left alone, but I don’t like being alone. Idk who to talk to, because if I open up I feel guilty cause I think people wouldn’t understand or I would just burden them with something small. Im so sick of telling people “I’m good” or “I’m fine, just tired.” when I’m honestly an the verge of breaking down. I’m not as happy as I once was and this unknown feeling is scary.

666,I'm not happy and don't really know what to do," 

Hey Reddit!

&#x200B;

(M21) I don’t really do this kind of thing because it can be a tad bit embarrassing and awkward to talk about. I feel like I just had to get something out there just so I guess there can be some kind of record. I just want to tell someone out there how I feel. So I don’t really know where to begin or where to really start where my problems lie. Sorry if I go all over the place and how long this post is.

&#x200B;

I’m pretty much at an all time low in my life and what feels like my rock bottom. It’s mainly been these past 3 years since 2020 that have completely fucked up my life. My parents are getting divorced, everything/everyone I cared about is out of my life, my house is being torn apart and renovated, an also toxic household, failing grades in college, people who have moved on to have better lives than me, no one I know (outside of the internet) gives a shit about my hobbies or what I like and, the one that hurts me the most for some reason, I don’t have a girlfriend.

&#x200B;

So yeah my parents divorcing I guess isn’t too much of a surprise in retrospect. My dad was an alcoholic and took A SHIT TON of ambien. I mean have gotten the medicine wrong. But holy shit I have so many stories of how my dad made the biggest ass out of himself because of this stuff. He’s a good man and I know this. The reason he began one is because sometime in 2011, he was kicked out of the police force and that left a huge scar for him. I don’t wanna get into the details, but he basically got fucked over because someone won a law suit over him. Something like that. He only started in December of 2020 after getting my brother arrested. That was the final straw for my mom and even if my dad did stop drinking she didn't care. So we've kind of just been going through this transition for the past 3 years of moving out. It's been the most painful thing I ever felt because I never had to deal with something like this. For the longest time I've always kind of assumed things sort themselves out and eventually become okay. They don't.

&#x200B;

There's always this guy that lives in my house and I wish I could tell you more about him… but I can't. This is due to the fact that I don't even know who this guy is and he's been living in my house for 3 years. He was also ""Moved in"" in 2020 and my dad at the time didn't take too kindly to this. Me and my brother kind of just assumed he was being an asshole as usual for no reason because of the Ambien. But looking back on it I kind of get it now. My dad had no idea who this guy was and now being told by my mom ""He's a part of this family now."" She told him 2 weeks before she was making these plans and he was already going to be moving in. My parents have been married since the 90s, and my dad had no idea who this guy was and never heard his name before. Apparently he's a drug addict and also an alcoholic. If it sounded like my dad was bad at times, OH BOY, this dude is even worse. This dude is basically on life support and my mom is kind of just delaying the inevitable. I know that sounds like the most heartless someone could say, but I can't see anything else happening. The reason she brought him in was so that she could help him recover. It's been three years and there has been literally no progress made on his health. I had to carry this guy out of my house because he was on an overdose and had to be rushed to the hospital. That is how bad it is. Not only that the guy is a fucking prick. He argues with my mom more so than my dad did it. With my dad, there was usually a pattern with how the arguments happened. It was usually at night time where people would be drinking and would be around bedtime. With this guy, it doesn't matter what time of the day it is. Morning, afternoon, night, mid night, 4 fucking AM. My mom and this guy are arguing all the goddamn time. I think maybe it's gotten a bit calm, but that still doesn't distract from the fact that I do not like this guy. I don't like talking to him, I don't like his attitude… I basically don't like anything about him. And like my dad, I also have a ton of stories I could tell you about this goofball and how many times he is fucked up. Only in a span of 3 years have I just hated someone. For the record, hate is a strong word but I can't take it anymore. After like three years of this shit, how can't I get Fed up? It just feels as if everyone in my family is at each other's throats. Not to say that we hate each other or anything, but it's just so toxic and not a good living condition. Especially with seeing my own house getting torn apart by this dude and them taking forever to finish something. So yeah one of my bathrooms now looks like a construction site. It's all because some guy is drunk all the time and can't finish anything. In fact a house that I've known for all my life being torn before my eyes. It feels like the memories I've had of my childhood are just fading away and being erased from history. At least with my dad he was still my dad and I still love him. This guy is just a complete stranger, no blood relation or anything. So yeah… I hate him.

&#x200B;

School could be going a bit better, but truth be told it's not really as bad as everything else that I listed out earlier. Pretty self-explanatory I think.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I look people have better lives than me. Maybe it's all smoking mirrors and a mask they are hiding behind, but I can't even pretend to act like my life is good. When I invite friends over, they can tell that this sucks. I go to friends' houses. They have loving families, a house that's still intact, good paying jobs and so much more. Not only that, I've known a lot of people who were nobodies and then became famous on platforms like YouTube. I won't say who they are, because I just feel like they kind of left me behind and have let the power get to them. I do have a YouTube channel where I do stuff (not going to be promoting it here or saying who I am), but I'm not exactly very popular. I'm very small and whenever I tell people who I know people usually don't believe me. Hell my own brother talks about some of these people and I just sit and nod knowing that these people have become more successful than me. One of them has caring friends, a loving fiance, a house that he owns and a YouTube channel with a shit ton of subscribers and viewers. I forgot to mention he was 18 when all that happened. Those are all things that I want in my life but don't have. Not only that I'm reminded of it constantly. Hell, I was just reminded about it today when I opened up my steam profile and saw someone commented wanting to know more about these people. I get that a lot too of people not caring who I am and just wanting to only talk to these YouTubers. Basically just spanning me and annoying me. I tell them that there is a reason they have direct DMs on discord. Then again the more I think about it, do I really want to be so famous that I have people like this wanting to talk to me? It feels like everyone around me just has a better life than me. It makes me wonder what the hell have I been doing for all my life. The thing that sucks about my friends and people I know IRL is that we have nothing in common. I love retro gaming, transformers, history, story telling, video editing etc. Yet my friends… don't care. Example: I tell them to watch Breaking Bad because it's a really God damn good show and usually they just don't care. After a year and a half I finally convinced one of my friends to watch Breaking Bad and he really enjoys it (told them so). I don't know, I just feel as if everyone I meet feels the same. I generally try talking to them and I just can't get through with them. It feels as if we have nothing in common because I'm not really interested in the trends or what's popular right now. I can't really say I'm an introvert or extrovert but rather in between. It really depends on what mood I'm feeling that day. I might be sorry one day, I might be myself one day. It's kind of random and all over the place. This is sort of why I love the internet because I met people who have the same interests as me who I would have NEVER met in real life. Yeah that's kind of how I feel about my friends, I care about them but we have nothing in common. My Discord pals are basically the best friends I've always wanted but never had. 

&#x200B;

Lastly, the one that really fucked me up is that I just don't have a girlfriend. I know that might sound dumb to some people and the more I think about it the more I wonder why I even want it. I've been wanting a girlfriend for as long as I can remember. I've been wanting one since 8th grade, heck maybe even earlier than that. But I just can't get one, no matter how hard I try. I know there's a lot of people who think they're going to be alone forever and yet they haven't done anything. At least I actually have a reason to feel the way I do, I've actually tried to do stuff about. I've been rejected, friend zoned and lied to. Name it and I have probably had to deal with it at one point or another. But I feel like I get looked down upon because of this fact that I never had a girlfriend. My family sure as hell has made fun of me for it in the past and that didn't help. Not only that, I'm reminded of it EVERYDAY. I see couples, people asking me if I have a girlfriend, people bringing it up. Like God damn I can't escape it. And a lot of people might say you have to love yourself before you can love someone else. I get that, I've had like a decade to think about it and I've already gone through the phase. I do love myself and I don't want to change as a person. But knowing this it just hurts more and more every day. I've had crushes come and go like clouds, hell I don't even remember 90% of their names. I have a lot of awkward crush stories actually. My last day being 19, I got into a car accident with one of my crush dads at the time and my former job. After that happened I pretty much just dropped that crush because it was just too awkward. That was actually my breaking point in 2021, that's about when I realized I regretted my whole life and hated my status of living. Everything that you're reading right now kind of came out from that day. I'm not sure why, but I kind of just sat there and wondered ""What the hell did I do with my life?"" I wish getting rejected made things easier, but it really does make things more difficult. It just makes me not want to do it anymore because of how humiliating and embarrassing it can get. The first time I asked someone out was back when I turned 20 and I was actually really happy that day because I finally did something I couldn't do for all my life. She rejected me… obviously. But it still was a good day for me. Here I am now still wanting one after all this time. Hell to make it even more sadder, every birthday wish I wish for is just to get a girlfriend. But it never comes true and I don't even know why I bother anymore. Online dating was sort of the last thing I wanted to do, I did open up a tinder and it didn't really get any matches. That's mainly due to the fact that I have to pay a fee to see my results. Recently I've thought about paying the fee just so I can get someone. Asking people out and talking to them in person sure as hell haven't helped me. It might sound impatient of me, but I am just tired of waiting. I hate having to hear everyone around me tell me that they have these girlfriends and dates when I can't even know a girl for more than 2 years. Some people have tried to help, but they have never went anywhere and have never actually gotten me anywhere closer. To me it's kind of like buying lottery tickets, you're not going to win but you might as well spend the wheel. I took a test about my level of happiness and apparently it's at 60%. Obviously it was an online test and online test shouldn't judge or determine how you feel about something. But in all honesty I actually can believe that. One of the lowest scores I got on the test was relationships. It was one of the biggest downfalls for the test. And I would be lying to myself if I didn't say that I didn't think about it all the time. Seriously every day I think about wanting a girlfriend. Hell at some points I kind of wonder if it's even worth it and I just want to know what it's like. Hell even if I went on a date for one day that would sore as hell would boost up so much morale for me. Yeah this is one of the biggest ones for me and why I'm just not really that happy. But truth be told, I can go on for hours and hours. I don't want to make it sound as if I truly have the worst life of all time, because there are people out there who have it much worse than I do. I just wished that made things easier for me but it doesn't. So what was the point of this post? I really don't know. I just hope somebody out there can read this and just maybe relate or help me make me feel better. There's just so much stuff on my plate and how I feel that I wish I could tell you all it. But I know it's too much information to throw up so I think I'll just leave things there. But yeah that's kind of how I feel about my life right now.",1679017712.0

671,Feels like I'm rubber banding between hypersomnia and insomnia,"Things are going to get confusing real fast here, just fair warning lol. I'm meeting with my therapist today and I'll probably try and discuss this, if I get the courage to.

Anyway. Starting Sunday night, I stayed up from 6 pm Sunday until 2 pm Monday. I just wasn't tired, but ended up passing out (figuratively) on the couch. Slept for 5 hours, then ended up going to sleep again at 1 am on Tuesday. Woke up at 7 am. Then I didn't sleep until 7 am Wednesday, woke up at 5 pm. It's now 10 am on Thursday and I haven't slept at all. 

I'm already struggling with the other symptoms of depression and anxiety, but this rubber banding of sleep is just really rough. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills (although I try not to have those easily accessible at the moment), no electronics for hours before bed, all that stuff. But I still end up lying awake just thinking. And that makes me feel even shittier, so I get up and do something to distract myself. 

It's hard because I want to sleep, I know I should go to sleep, but then I have to wake up and I'm so miserable when I wake up. I'm aware of my life as soon as I wake up and the worst part is, my life is decent. So it's not like I can even point to a reason as to why I'm depressed. I just am, and it feels like there's nothing I can do about it.

Anyway. I guess I'm just looking for some support. Like I said, I'm going to try talking to my therapist today, but I've never talked about anything like this before so it's kinda scary, to be honest. We talk a lot about how I seem like I'm doing really well mentally and it's hard to say ""well actually"".",1678986982.0

And It works so well. But I'm struggling

I hate life. And I feel like life hates me. I can't truely cry. I feel like I'm going to but it goes away. And the small times I do cry, it's just a couple of tears and then no more. Like, I can't cry any longer. And even when I feel sad, It's more of a numbness. And it's getting worse. The times I actually full on cry now for hours like I used too, are during really really bad mental breakdowns which even those are very rare and occasional now. So I'm stuck with a constant numbness. And the only few things that make me happy are or don't feel numb, are very limited people and even some of those people can't help.

I'm at a major loss with myself and I know I'm starting to lose myself within the numbness quicker than ever. And I don't know what to do anymore....",1678978988.0
674,Do I have depression/am depressed? Or am I just lazy?,"Note: I’ve posted this before. 

I don’t know if I’m depressed or actually just sad. The past few years my mindset has gone really bad. I’ve lost interest in the things I used to do and my relationships with friends and family. My irritability and mods swings have gotten worse, the smallest things can set me off and it’s really affected my family life. I don’t mean to get mad, but I can’t help it. I don’t think I’m mentally doing alright, but I don’t think it’s depression. Maybe something else. 

I think what really took a toll on me was my recent losses. My cousin and uncle (family friend) passed away a month apart from, this was last year. My aunty, who I was never really close with, but had always been grateful for, also passed away recently. My cousin and uncle’s passing, really sent me into a bad mindset.

My family life isn’t the best or worst either. To keep it short, parents are separate. 

I have a low self-esteem, which is way I hate myself. I don’t like the way I look and speak. I don’t like what I see in the mirror. I wish I was prettier and had a more feminine look. I know it’s bad to compare yourself to others, but I can’t help it. I feel like every time I step outside I’m being judged, even when people aren’t looking at me. 

I have trouble sleeping. Sometimes I sleep for 9 hours, but most of the time I get like 3-4 hours maybe an hour of sleep. My brain can’t shut off. But when I do go to sleep early, I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. Which means that I’ll be tired going to school in the morning. I’m also a big procrastinator. Like I do work in class, but most of the time, I’m daydreaming about something (I’m the type to make up fake scenarios in their heads, lol). I get sidetracked too. This really impacts my school life cause I can’t get anything done and leave it till the last minute. In most of my exams, I freeze up cause I don’t know what to do, I get overwhelmed instantly. I tend to fidget a lot too, which again, doesn’t help. My school life I think also makes me feel slight worthless, cause I don’t have the perfect grades. Their average. 

I feel like I’m a pretty average teen. I’m happy, but most of the time I feel like I’m trapped in this dark empty hole and everything I do is a waste. I feel like I’m backed into a corner where I can’t escape it. All I want to do is curl up and cry all the time. And it doesn’t help cause I hate talking about my feelings. I feel like it will just burden the person, or they won’t even care. Tbh, I don’t know how to cope with these feelings. Every time I zone out and people ask me if I’m good I say I’m fine, but something inside just wants to breaks down and tell them I’m not fine. I feel burnt out, like everything is so much effort and now even talking to my friends seems like a lot of effort. I hate this feeling. I hate going out, I want to stay home. But I can’t even stand the state of my room, clothes are every where, random junk on my beside table, old schools books scattered around my room, things cramped under my bed and random shit on my bed like papers and tissues (cause I was sick). I haven’t been bothered cleaning my room cause honestly, I don’t have the effort and mental capacity to do that. Cause, ain’t nobody got time for that (it was funnier in my head). Despite not having the effort to talk to people, it doesn’t mean that i won’t worry for them. I do. I worry a lot to the point where even the thought of them in danger pushes me into a small breakdown. 

I try to make myself happy, like put on a smile, try different things, be more active, talk more, try to get more sleep, but nothings working. And it took so much effort out of me. I try cleaning but it only last a couple of hours before i get tired. I feel bad cause my dad always asks me to clean my room and do chores, but its so much effort. Then he thinks I’m just lazy, but I seriously don’t have the capacity to do it anymore. I’m so tired mentally, emotionally and physically. I hate the things I’m feelings. I hate the fact I can’t talk to someone about how I’m feeling. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone about it, cause I’ll either feel like a burden or they won’t even care or brush it off. I can’t talk with my dad because he’ll say you’re too much on your phone and when I’m not on my phone and sleep cause I’m too tired and overwhelmed of everything he says I’m probably just tired. Same with my mom. At least that’s what I think they will say. I hate the fact I can’t go a day without feeling some sort of sadness that is constantly coming back, even when I’m feeling happy. I feel hopeless in this situation. I want to just be numb. I’m drowning myself with these feelings and I don’t even know what it is.",1678972753.0
675,I feel stuck,"Tw/// I haven't been diagnosed with depression, finally making some progress with general anxiety. I just started taking buspar along with my seizure meds which are supposed to be used for anxiety and depression as well. I guess it started a couple years ago when I had my first seizure while driving and totalled my vehicle. It was terrifying, I  had never felt so close to mortality. It felt like I had lost any sense of freedom, feeling stuck at my narcissistic father's house, i had to quit my job and i bever got to see any of my friends. I was in between two guys at the time but I ended up leaving one for the other, I thought he was the love of my life. He ended up moving like thousands of miles away. I moved in with my sister shortly before he asked me to come live with him. Of course I did but it was a scary experience. He ended up becoming really abusive and we'd get into fights all the time. We got kicked out of where we were living so I had to leave everything I had to come back home. Me and the guy were still talking but it was on and off until he unalived himself. That was a couple years ago and it's still really hard to live with. He was one of my best friends for a really long time despite our toxic relationship. So years later I've been thru a few different jobs, therapy, still no car, and renting a new place with a friend of mine. I want to move on but I'm afraid of getting hurt again. It feels like im being held down by a weight. Sometimes it feels like I'm going to explode. I have close friends and family that care about me but there's still a sense of loneliness. Hobbies and special interests dont seem to make me feel anything anymore. Idk. This is my first post. Thanks for reading",1678983729.0
676,"Need help here, big-time","It's bad, real bad. I've been almost too depressed to do anything for months now, Then again, that's kind of wrong, I've been depressed almost my entire life, just recently it's slipped so much that I am at the deepest I have ever been. This is my final gambit, the absolute last attempt at connecting with something, anything, for help. All of my shouting into the void over the past few months has been met with nothing but complete, overbearing silence.

&#x200B;

I spend around 95% of my time in total isolation in this small, dark room. My daily routine consists of sleeping (precisely midday until around midnight usually, but these are interspersed throughout periods of being awake for 24+ hrs) and working online, doing schoolwork particularly. I don't talk to anyone I live with and very rarely even see them. I do not actually do the schoolwork properly, I only cheat because my mind has rotted to the point of only barely being able to form cohesive thoughts and I am tired to the point of being on the verge of passing out at ALL times, no matter how long or well I sleep, I am always able to nod off even while walking. This cheating is also because, frankly, I don't see a point. I never did particularly well and at no point will I ever be able to afford entering into higher education if I somehow graduate. On top of that, the world is just going to shit, there's no reason to create a legacy or continue the family or even just be happy by myself since in a few years it's just going to be an even more hellish dystopia than it already is, the few careers I was once interested in are now either pointless due to being privatized/exploited for money/censorship, or replaced by AI. This cycle is all I do, all day every day, for months, nonstop. Sleep, get up and walk 2 feet to my desk, mindlessly copy/paste for many hours until I collapse from exhaustion and repeat.

&#x200B;

I struggle with a whole cast of mental disorders, primarily intense anxiety and autism, among other things. I am so socially inept I can barely hold my own or act normal in a social situation and avoid going into public or talking to people face-to-face as much as possible out of fear of judgement. My mind feels like a constant uncontrollable hurricane of terrible thoughts. On top of that I am constantly contending with some extreme suicide related trauma but many other smaller traumas as well, all completely unattended, never could talk about it due to my family's complete lack of communication and essentially some kind of silent-running policy where we all visibly acknowledge things that have happened but through quick eye glances apparently agree not to talk about it audibly. Nobody except my online friends knows about my current state, as if this information got out to my family it would cause the only person keeping us barely afloat to have a complete mental breakdown and get us evicted due to not working a couple days. I am certain of this because it has, indeed, happened before but I was able to salvage the situation by some quick thinking and some impressively elaborate lying.

&#x200B;

I might be going insane. I am hallucinating near constantly, hearing scratching and knocking on walls and doors, seeing things out of the corners of my vision such as tall shadow figures and massive insects that dart away when I look at them. In fact, sometimes as of late it's not even corners. I open a door and see someone just straight up standing there right in front of me that quickly retreats around the corner or into the wall/ceiling/floor. Sometimes, when I peer into dark spaces, I can see something looking back at me, evidently not staved off by my recognizing it. My sleep is plagued by endless vivid nightmares, for example my most recent one was of being pursued by an incomprehensible eldritch flesh mass covered in screaming human faces that would always eventually subject me to some purgatory-like torment in an attempt to make me kill myself. This was followed by being in an abandoned building with ever single surface being covered in eyes that would stare at me, eventually impaling me with spikes. Other times I have recurring dreams about waking up in a dark, empty hospital surrounded by an endless, generic town and field coated completely in black texture that gets vaguely lighter the farther I go from it, and above is a desolate sky. I am always wearing a hospital gown with one of my eyes gouged out, and many times I have had other missing limbs, seen loved ones, or had oily black tendrils come out of my chest and empty eye socket in these dreams. While awake I constantly have intrusive thoughts about killing myself or thoughts about brutally attacking anyone I see.

&#x200B;

I don't do anything else in my life besides work and sleep, for the most part. I don't leave my house (can't actually, at least I can't go anywhere that has anything besides emptiness) and have zero local friends, my only handful of friends are online but they're rarely on and they never ever talk to me unless it's about whatever dumb game they're into at the time, opting to ignore me instead in every other circumstance. As of recently it's starting to look like most of them simply do not give a shit about me. I have tried for months to find other friends but all has failed as my current friends are only around me because of incredible luck and circumstances years ago, no such thing can be repeated. I have posted on friend-searching subreddits of all kinds, gone to online places that supposedly have people with the same interests as me, all sorts of things, and everything has turned up empty. I have always been completely ignored, my existence means nothing to anyone and I have nothing to offer that would make me stand out enough for even a single person to notice me and not forget after a day. Even my own family forgets about me near constantly. The only people that don't ignore me are bots. Actually, *as I am writing this* one of my friends just acknowledged an request for help and responded only with mockery.

&#x200B;

I have zero interests whatsoever, everything I used to like I have lost interest in either due to it going to shit, or because of my own inadequacy. I have spent months and years looking for a productive, fun hobby that I can dedicate myself to but everything I try I fail at miserably, I can do nothing well at all and I know this for a fact after having tested it for so long. I cannot gain any skills either no matter how hard I try, my mind just feels handicapped. I am completely useless. All of the hobbies that I didn't fail at, are just too expensive since I am almost totally broke and will be going bankrupt soon. This also explains why therapy and medication is out of reach for me, as well as any kind of decent nutrition besides the equivalent of the college student ramen diet... or anything else you can throw in a microwave for a couple moments. Across the rest of my life before now, it has always been this way. I have not experienced many things that most people would consider normal life experiences, only monotony and isolation, being able to see how life is supposed to be through quietly watching others. I have never done anything worth noting in my life. Not once. No activities of any kind out of the bare minimum normal routine, no accomplishments, no important memories, and most importantly, no ambitions to be had.

I'm pretty sure the reason my depression is getting bad again is because I injured myself a while back. I fell really hard almost two months ago and to this day it still hurts to bend my knee. Right after I fell it was so painful to even sit up or bend my knee in anyway that I could hardly do anything,  even go to the bathroom. I ended up missing a lot of classes and falling behind in course work. Being in pain all the time and being tired is so... draining. I can hardly bring myself to do anything nowadays.

686,Need help,"
Context:- I am a pretty good student academically and i scored 92% in my highschool finals.

My family told me to pursue medical after highschool. On contrast I am pretty good at computer science and i scored 98 on that paper, i love coding and i can do it all day. But since I was naive at the time i listened to my family and chose the carrier they wanted me to pursue.

It's been 3 years of me taking entrance exams for a medical college without any success. In India it's really tough to enter a government college and it has a selection ratio of 2 percent.

My family is fed up of me failing to get in a college after 3 years and they call me worthless. My dad beated the shit out of me a few days ago just because he had a bad day. He told me to die somewhere out there by getting chopped up by a train ( my house is really close to railway tracks).

I ran away from home that day and returned in the evening. My mom was crying.

But now after 3 days my mom and sister are back to calling me worthless and a stain to the family.

I made some money off of coding for a guy (freelance stuff) and bought myself a gift. But my family is saying I'm incompetent and i don't deserve it and that this chump change won't make a difference.

I've been contemplating it i should just end all this suffering sooner or later since I'm at my limit.

The only one I feel sorry for is my mom because she was genuinely worried when I disappeared.

687,How to not backslide into depression when my circumstances are depressing?,"Hi all. I’m a 40-year-old male with a history of depression since high school or maybe middle school. I managed it very well without medication until 36 when I began taking Wellbutrin. Well, unfortunately Wellbutrin sent me further into a hole that went deeper than I ever knew possible. I went off it for a short period, starting doing well, met a wonderful woman that I love like crazy, but unfortunately went back on it not realizing it was causing serious problems. 

Resuming the Wellbutrin caused my entire personality to change, as well as my decision making and thought patterns. I became very detached, stopped showing her affection, and was just a total shell of myself. My dose was doubled. I became suicidal. I then made up an insane lie about my mom being ill because I thought I needed some cover story to allow me to leave when I was truly ready to kill myself and that is what I did. I abandoned her in a craze, only to snap out of it long enough to realize something was deeply wrong in my head. I was totally confused as I had never acted like this. I never fell out of love with her and I sure as hell was not someone who would make up elaborate lies, nor was I ever suicidal even at my worst before something snapped.

I realized the major changes coincide with Wellbutrin, stopped with my doctors blessing , and sure enough I totally stabilized. So that is great. I am happy to be alive. I feel lots of great emotions that have been dormant for 4 years. But I’ve also set fire to our relationship and my life feels unrecognizable in many ways. I am a very lucky man and she was willing to hear me out and see how things shook out. We are not in a relationship, but we are spending time together which is a hell of a start. We spent the weekend together out of town and it was one of the happiest times I’ve ever had. Not only was I with the woman I love in a beautiful setting, but I was feeling all these things that have been buried underneath the rubble for years and it was so goddamn good to share that with her. We both talk about the fact that we can lead happy lives no matter what happens, but while I acknowledge that to be true I know that she’s the woman I want to spend my life with. She always has been. I don’t know what happened to me, but I know how I feel when I am not short circuiting to a degree that I can’t comprehend and nothing has changed.

So I am very happy with that side of things. I have plenty to be grateful for. But things are still tough as hell right now. We aren’t the same nor should we be. She’s beyond understanding and seems to take seriously the fact that my behavior was totally altered by out of control brain chemistry, but I still betrayed and abandoned her and you can’t just pretend that didn’t happen or suddenly make it all better. Because of that I am living in a crappy hotel while I look for an apartment. Things feel very strange in that regard. I’m going to be living in some strange place, and the woman who was my partner is now someone I am dating. Moreover, she is not someone I can really approach about the sadness I feel because it isn’t fair to her. I’m not a bad guy and I was not of sound mind, but I did what I did and there is a lot of work to be done before there is any hope that we are back together.

I’m fully ready to do the work, and I genuinely feel stable and my emotions are by and large good ones. But there is still sadness there. More than that there is some fear. Returning to this hotel alone was a shock to my system. Not knowing that I would be able to look into her eyes or feel her next to me in bed was painful. Knowing that I occupy this different space for her right now is jarring, and I also think so often of the pain that I have caused her. In many ways I feel like I have to thread the needle here at a time where things have been shaken to the core. I want to show her I care and want her to know that I miss her like crazy, but I don’t want to expose her to my sadness when she has to worry about herself. I want to be involved but want to give her space. I want to maintain my relatively happy disposition but I come home to an environment where I’m constantly reminded of what I have lost. 

There have been plenty of tears but I don’t feel that same depression. My sadness makes sense and it’s often replaced by increased focus and motivation to do the work to continue getting better while also showing her that I’m the loving man she used to trust. I guess I just worry that the circumstances of my life will knock me off track. I am not clinically depressed but it would be easy to backslide in this depressing situation. How do I manage that fear?

TL;DR: spent years in mental hell thanks to Wellbutrin, blew up relationship in the process. Stopped Wellbutrin and feel normal mentally but trying to not let actually depressing circumstances get the best of me. Trying to fight like hell to mend the relationship but worried that the isolation and distance will just trigger depression and I don’t want to let it get the best of me / don’t want to lose her thanks to some combo of the distance and the sadness that comes with it. Need to just stay the course at a time when my head feels better and my circumstances are a lot worse.",1678869964.0
688,I wished to write a book about depression,"Today, I feel like crying, but nothing ever runs down my cheeks. I am incapable of swallowing, sleeping, working, being happy, wish me the best, brush my teeth. I wish to cancel every plans with my friends, I wish to not even think about the plans waiting for me to say yes to with other friends. 

Every day I go on Instagram, I remember the unanswered messages, one week if I'm lucky, two months if I'm facing the truth. I cannot be there for my friends anymore. Any contact drains me out and puts me to bed for hours, it hurts me thinking that about my friends. 

I don't see even see friends often outside of the compulsory events, university classes. I can't. It takes me too much time to recover and make me enjoyable again. I fall asleep around my friends, at the university, at my house. I'm not pleasant being around anymore. My friends still love me but it hurts not being able to call them close friends anymore. They drift away, they used to stay attached to me, but if I don't reciprocate, the waves just finish pushing them away. 

Inside of me is an ocean. It can be beautiful, it can be deep, it can contain many pearls and gems. 
It can also be dark, and bottomless. It has lots of waves, it's easy to drown into.
I just see myself slowly diving into this void. Gosh, it hurts. Depression is not being able to create your own energy, or at least not enough to go through the day. You cannot expect to save yourself with the limitless energy you have. 

I'll maybe come back here to keep going. This is all I can say today without deleting anything. If any one reads that, please, take care of you",1678914637.0

690,A tip I find that works good for me!,"I don’t know if it’s been said yet, I saw an idea like this online a few years ago and sorta worked with it to fit me better. 


Use a glass water bottle. Or any water bottle that catches your eye- colour, pattern, design, etc. 

Make a point to use it, to fill it up when your in the kitchen. It’s a small task, but the feeling of completing a task no matter how small helps me a lot. 

However make sure to keep a handful of disposable water bottles under your bed or near your bed. It’s good to complete a task, but the days that I just can’t get out of bed having the backup water in my room is a good thing. Being hydrated helps the brains. 

That’s all, stay strong friendos :) 💜",1678879509.0

693,Struggling with comparing myself to my friends.,"I (22M) have always had troubles with my self-esteem and social anxiety. I’ve always believed that I was less worthy than others, or didn’t belong in the groups I found myself in growing up. These feelings, along with my social anxiety, made it really easy to shy away from experiences where I could fail and from people who intimidated me. Because of this, I feel that I wasn’t able to reach many of the “social milestones” or socially develop in a healthy way. Now, I am a recent college graduate who is currently living with friends 

These last few years have been particularly hard. My mental health has been very tumultuous and there have been very low lows. I would go as far as to say that these last couple years have been the worst of my life. Negative self-talk has been my biggest issue through all of this, and at this point my inner narrative has been shaped into one of fear and shame. I often feel bad about myself because of my lack of experience socially and in life, and I also feel shame because I have been living with my mental illness for so long. I’ve gone through many mental breakdowns, especially in these last few months, and these have caused me to feel really unstable emotionally.  I still have stretches of days where I can barely get out of bed and feel so lifeless and empty. My brain is working against me more often than not. I even had to quit my job recently due to my mental illness, and generally it feels like my depression and anxiety has taken control over my life and 

My roommates, and the majority of my friends, are in better spots in their lives than I am right now, and have had a more normal social development. They have jobs, significant others, are able to travel, find joy in their hobbies, and generally live more content lives. This is not to say that they don’t have their own troubles, of course they do, but they are able to cope with their troubles in a much more constructive way and are generally able to lead fulfilling lives. That is what it looks like from my perspective, anyway.

Its so hard for me to feel good about where I am in life when I see people close to me seemingly doing it better. They are all doing the things that I so insecurely want for myself, and it seems like they are all able to do it much easier and more confidently. I’m happy for them, they are all really cool people and I am glad that I get to be a part of their lives and see their happiness. However, I can’t help but feel bad for myself when I am around them, and I always find myself in a shame spiral after we hang out. Their successes remind me so much of my failures. Their achievements remind me so much of what I’m not able to do right now because of my mental illness. While there is some envy and resentment because of this, I mostly feel intense shame in myself and inadequate. It makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me inherently. Like I’m broken :/

I am receiving treatment. I go to therapy and have a psychiatrist, and I’m at a point in my life now where I am able to focus totally on feeling better, but the work is hard and the results don’t necessarily feel significant yet. I’m frustrated and it seems like I’m just not good enough. I just want to get to a place where I can feel confident in myself and can show up in my life in the ways that I want to and see others doing now.",1678863372.0
694,I'm lost,"Hey everybody, I don't really do this whole social media thing so forgive me if this isn't the place to rant or whatever. I'm a freshman in college and on my own in NY. Ever since I got here I have felt so lost and out of place almost as if im just a zombie going through the motions but not really living life. I have no one to talk to about this stuff and I don't want to burden my family with it. I struggle to apply myself in my classes and I can say I have honestly lost my sense of identity. I feel alone all the time even though I'm surrounded by people. 

I never struggled with mental health at all, but a couple of months ago I had a pretty bad knee accident that left me bed bound for a long period of time and from that moment on I haven't felt the same since.

711,My sister is severely depressed and I'm scared,"Soo I never really posted anything on reddit but here we go. My sister (16) and I (19) have had a pretty bad childhood. Our mom died of cancer when we were 3 and 6 and our father has basically lost his mind ever since. He physically and emotionally abused us - he locked us in our room for hours without any food or anything, got mad and hurt us when we spilled water etc. We weren't allowed to say anything and we didn't do so because we were to scared of what would happen. long story short - we were just kids and had to basically live on our own. 

We now still live with our father and he still has these outbursts - he doesn't hurt us anymore due to our stepmom but he is still abusing us emotionally. This doesn't affect me that much because I am not that much at home anymore due to work or my.bf (19). But my sister is severely depressed (diagnosed) and told me several times that it gets worse every day. I am extremely worried since she has absolutely no social life - I am the only person she talks to. Just today she told me ""It's not about how I can live like this anymore, it's about how long I can live like this"". She also often says things like ""there is no reason why I am still alive"" and how she doesn't understand why god (if there's any) didn't let her die. She also goes to therapy but even that doesn't help - even her therapist said that there is nothing she could do and that she could just support her.

Long story short - I am extremely worried since she is my person. We were always together and our past just connects us two. She is like the other half of mine. I just want someone to help me. Maybe someone who overcame depression or was in a similar situation?

718,I'm thinking of kms. need some advice.,"Hi who ever is reading this, I don't know where to go, I'm in a dire situation with my life and I don't truly see no purpose to continue living. So I'm here seeking for some advice. 

So... here it goes:

I am a 22yr old guy, and by the end of this semester it's very possible that I'm gonna be suspended permanently from my college,  this is gonna be the second time I've failed college. I come from a very successful and strict family,  my parents are really successful and have a growing business, everyone in my family has already finished college including all my siblings and my cousins (I'm the youngest). My household is very strict, they expect from us the best, and I've become some sort of a black sheep.

I never did good at school, always had problems with my family for being gay (we're good now), It came as a huge blow when I failed college the first time around, but they quickly enrolled me in another college (a more expensive one) and now I'm in my 5 semester and It's most likely I'll be suspended permanently from this college too. 

I don't know what to do, I don't want to disappoint them even more, my oldest stepvrother failed college and they kicked him out of the house,  they were kind enough to pay me for another college and not kick me out, but now I'm failing them again. 

I'm 100% aware of the piece of sh*t, mess of a  nepo baby that I am, I'm aware of all the opportunities they've granted me and I just flopped them all.

I truly do know what I want for my future, I just want stability, security and luxury but I need to work and achieve things for that but I've just failed at every chance I had for my procrastination, lack of ambition and nonchalantness. 

Now I'm here, seeking strangers for advice.",1678688882.0
719,I don't know what to do anymore,"I've been struggling with what I've been diagnosed as depression and anxiety but I feel like there's more to it. I've been in therapy for two years, and with my current therapist for maybe a year now. I've tried a lot of medication but it really just made me feel physically sick. 

Because I don't outwardly present my issues, contrast to my older sister, my parents believe it's not bad. They don't really see how I struggle, and if they do, they don't acknowledge it. My sister has always had problems, she's has quite a restricting diet as she can't digest certain foods such as red meats, and she has an eating disorder. She struggles with sleep, depression, anxiety. All of this is relevant because I'm constantly ignored because of her. Part of me resents her, and it's just so damn tiring to hear ""oh sorry, we only cooked for (sister), she can't eat anything else) They're constantly coddling her to the point where I lash out at her sometimes. I would never try to hurt her, I tend to raise my voice a lot. 

If I don't shout, nothing gets heard. It just feels like they forgot about me sometimes, too much revolves around her and she's literally going off to college (if she doesn't drop out). She's not a baby anymore, I don't get why I have to be compared to her. If it's not as bad as her, it doesn't matter. 

I used to cut a lot when I was younger, the first time in grade 5 for attention but I think that really says something. I ended up getting stitches in my arm, but that did nothing, only more comments from my mom about how ugly it is. I don't cut anymore, even if I really want to, it just doesn't do anything, there's not point. I think my friend also helped with that though, but my parents hate her. I really wish things were better, honestly. I really try hard to get better, and do more things but anytime I even bother, it always gets shut down.

 I've been told I'm not the problem, and our family dynamic is a huge part in how I'm feeling, but there is something deep down that isn't right with me. I know it's not depression or anxiety, because I wouldn't feel this bad. Sometimes I just feel like I'm not a person, my actions don't have consequences. I'm just someone living and it doesn't matter how it ends. I've thought of killing people, my intrusive thoughts are very disturbing. I've tried telling my mom, I've tried drinking, it did nothing. Sometimes I'm worried I might act on it, but it only takes a few minutes to snap back into whats easiest to describe as my programmed personality. Nothing about my personality is real, it's just based on the others around me. Sometimes when I'm alone, I resent everyone I'm with. I feel like my real personality shows. Maybe I should just kill myself before I kill someone else. I think I'm truly insane, but I can't put my finger on what I could tell my therapist so I could get proper medication for whatever condition it is. Or maybe there isn't a solution, maybe I should be looked up. I don't know anymore .",1678688035.0

722,"This is my life. And I hate it, every second of it.","I’m 15 years old, 16 in July, and i’m being brought to my last legs. I have been a generally sad person ever since I was about 12. I’ve had this disease living and thriving inside me for a really long time, and it just gets nothing but stronger, and larger. It consumes me more every single day. I get told all the time “it gets better” “it’ll get better” “things get better”. But not once has anything happened that supports that sentiment. I can’t say confidently that I know what “real” happiness is. I am extremely suicidal, and whenever my mom leaves for work, I dare myself to cut myself, to take all the pills I can find in the medicine cabinet, to get my grandma to take me to the farm so I can shoot myself in the bush out back. But I can’t bring myself to because I know either my mom or my grandma would be the people who found me, and I can’t do that to them. So instead I look for pleasure in booze, drugs, sex etc. What’s worse is I know it’s not *actually* helping me, I’m fully aware of that. But I feel comfort in all of it. It allows me to forget for a little while that I wanna blow the back of my head off, it allows me to forget how broken as a human that I am. I’ve attempted to take my life once before, I was 13 when it happened. And I’d be lying if I said I regretted it. But I would be telling the truth when I say I regret it didn’t work. But I’d also be telling the truth when I say I’m glad my mom didn’t have to see me hanging cold. I didn’t even have a note written. So I took that into consideration. I have a pre-written note, for if I ever did cave in, and do it. It’s so hard to hang on, it is so terribly hard. I sit alone in my room for hours in silence, thinking, writing in my journal, crying etc.

I had a crush in my college days. It was my dream to have her as a friend. We slowly started talking, meeting. I never wanted to marry her but I want her as a friend in my life. Today she told me that her marriage is fixed. I was happy but deep down the heart, I am very hurt as I still love her and will always do. She has been my support system since last 2 years, supported me in tough times especially during Covid 19 phase, also in career. I fear that I would lose her which is bound to happen. I don't have many friends as well


Today, I had a talk with my crush and she was literally over the moon of getting married. I am worried about her as the man with him she is going to get married is 8 years elder. This would be a generation gap. She is saying that vibes are matching but the reality is that the boy is a millionaire, has a lot of property where she also said what would I want more. 

I am concerned as that guy is 32 years and he won't be getting younger by any means. Guys, I want to tell her personally that how she has been a pivotal part of life as we haven't met since 3 years. I am literally breaking down. I am getting insane. She has broken my heart multiple times still I have feelings for her. I personally believe that love happens in minutes. This is something else, I am not saying I want to marry her. I fear that I would lose her if I pour my heart infront of her. I am facing high fluctuations of heart  since the last 3 days.

I feel empty and like I’ve lost the zest for life. I feel a bit like I'm dead.

I feel so tired. I sleep for long lengths of time 12-15 hours sometimes.

I feel like I’ve lost my confidence. I feel anxious talking to people. I don’t feel I take much pride in my appearance I wear dark clothes that are baggy and hide my body.

I don’t see my friends. I avoid going on outings because of feeling ashamed of my body and weight gain. I also suffer from body dysmorphia and find dressing up can be very triggering for me because I don’t like how I look in the clothes.

I feel stuck.

I hate my job so so much (I work in hospitality) but when I start applying to new jobs I doubt myself being able to get a new one because of not having not much faith in myself. My dream is to work in a corporate job.

I do applications for jobs to get through to the next stages e.g. psychometric tests etc. to then not complete the next stage by the deadline. I over-procrastinate on everything in life. And I kick myself because I think to myself all the time I hate where I am in life why can’t I bring myself to change I don’t understand.

I worry about my future a lot. I’m a big overthinker and worrier. I put a lot of pressure on myself because I have dreams I want to achieve. But I doubt myself and feel my mum doesn’t believe in me which makes me doubt myself even more.

I get uncontrollably angry sometimes at work e.g, crying frequently, walking out etc.

I binge eat and feel out of control around food I overeat because it gives me something to look forward to because I don’t look forward to anything else in life.

I used to go gym regularly and see my personal trainer but I stopped because of feeling embarrassed about gaining weight and feel he’d be disappointed in me. I feel embarrassed and get social anxiety going to the gym.

I don’t go on holiday because of disliking my body, dreading how I’d look in a swimsuit.

I hate the lack of routine in my life. I feel like a mess all the time. I dislike working such unpredictable shifts. I feel it’s hard to organise my life go to the gym, do meal prep etc. when everything changes every week.

It’s like a never-ending cycle.

Can someone please help me? I can’t continue to live like this. And would really appreciate any guidance or encouragement. I’m just feeling so lost in life.

Some background info

1. I suffer from Body dysmorphia and OCD.
2. I’m 23 years old.
3. I’ve had lots of therapy in the past. I’ve been on antidepressants for 5 years and it takes too long to get therapy so I don’t think that it would be helpful in my case. I suffered from a drug overdose when I was 19 having felt a similar way I did now but my body dysmorphia & self-hatred was a lot worst.

729,Four AM Rant,"Very black thoughts and plans caused by depression and seeming inability to start any work or chores are overwhelming but surely (?) irrational and delusional. However, at some point you (I mean me) just realize how tired you are from all this. Sure, let's spend another five hours worth of energy to battle your sad mind, and when you're finally ready to start something, you are no longer having any actual powercharge to do it. How many times have this happened to you? How many _years_? How many more wars can you handle (it feels like a war every time)? Nobody wins a hundred consecutive wars. It's doomed from the start. Nothing's ever gonna change. Why waste your time on this earth to relive same thing causing you just pain, anxiety and devastation? Is there even a point to try again, when it's abundantly clear you're weak and broken and have to deal with an extreme amount of struggle to write a freaking text or take a freaking shower? It's not worth to endure such length to try and achieve any semblance of normal life that's never gonna come.

All this above may be delusional too. I say may be, but deep inside I don't believe it is. I'm afraid that this black thought becomes way too rational to ignore. It's not a depression talking anymore, it's calculated reason of how much can I sacrifice and what can I expect to achieve. Those numbers just don't add up.

Of course, I won't do anything about it, I'm a coward.

734,"Severe depression, short term disability leave","[28f] I recently had a severe depression relapse where my mind stopped functioning and I didn’t understand how to do work anymore after transitioning to a new team. I spent a month in training to backfill someone else’s role, right after the colleague left the team, the workload felt heavy I wasn’t understanding what to do or how to improve clients work. Its a very heavy external facing role to communicate with clients 4-5x a week. I had a panic attack when workload became too overwhelming and contemplated suicide. I spoke with my family about what was happening and they helped me draft a short term disability leave for a few weeks. 

I went on short term disability leave for 4 weeks in the middle of a hectic work week and left my tasks for my teammates to handle while I dealt with the medical crisis. I was prescribed to escopram 10mg for anxiety and depression. during my medical leave, I stayed home, did therapy once a week, slept a lot and watched a lot of tv shows. I didn’t want to socialize with anyone but it’s hard living with bf family. I normally would enjoy cooking, while depressed I can’t find the enjoyment or motivation to cook anything. I no longer have an appetite and I lost 10Lbs within 2 months. I feel lazy not wanting to do anything. The last time I felt this way was 8 years ago when both of my grandparents passed away. It took me half a year to recover and get my life back together. I have to return to work soon and I’ve decided to quit the job. I rather let the employer know earlier to find replacement than prolong my leave. I thought about not logging in to my work laptop so they can fire me where I can receive unemployment benefits. But that will affect my future jobs. 
Whenever I close my eyes, I dream about ways to not exist. I felt like I’ve ruined my reputation at work. 

Backstory
I just got my life together mid last year where I thought I’m finally where I’m at in life. Working at a global company in a senior position. It’s my first time working for a big progressive corporate company, I’ve worked hard to pass 4 rounds of interviews. It’s a hybrid role where I get to work in office twice a week which I enjoyed while it lasted. I was working on a fairly easy client account only managing one channel. My manager was very hands on with the client account where they conducted external calls until my colleague and I became more comfortable with public speaking. At the end of the year, the client decided to leave the firm so my team was scattered to different client accounts. I was unfortunately placed on a high demanding client account with lots of meetings a week. My workload went from one channel to three channels that I’m unfamiliar with. I felt isolated all of the time, my colleagues don’t communicate with me, my new manager wasn’t hands on with my work that I don’t  understand. I couldn’t find the connection with the team either, a majority of them Are males and I can’t connect to their conversations.",1678609893.0
735,Recurrent depressive disorder: how it looks like.,"Hello everyone,

I suffer from recurrent depressive disorder, which is an unipolar, cycling, treatment-resistant form of depression.  I'm currently hospitalised, so I wanted to share on this sub. This is my mood chart across several recent years of my life. The onset of my disease was earlier, but I started monitoring my mood later on.

[Mood chart](https://preview.redd.it/q258ezn9n9na1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c304590e604507b4ca10ac91d12232364823c490)

The various smoothed curves help me to notice some patterns, like the period of the recurrence as well as the duration of depressive episodes.

My current psychiatrist is not quite sure of this diagnostic, and has a suspicion of bipolarity (among other stuffs). To me however, it only matters that I suffer from this and I want to get better. For anyone coping with a similar pattern of depression, I can tell that I now know that, for me, it gets better. Every time. The downside is that it also comes back. I'm in the process of accepting this condition, getting help when necessary and that I'll always be a sensitive person in that regard.

Anyways, thanks for reading and please take care of yourselves.

740,Am I the asshole? My mum forces me to hide my self harm scars,"I cut myself on my arms. I don’t do this for attention, I do it because I suffer with severe  bouts of depression and I have for years. I try not to do it, and I realise that it is a very unhealthy coping strategy, and that it understandably really upsets my mum. She cares a lot about me, and I love her more than anyone in the world. But sometimes my mental health problems just get too much for a few seconds, and I just fall into cutting myself. I feel very guilty about it. 

My mum and I recently had a big fight about it, and she says that it is completely insensitive, selfish, and irresponsible to go to work with these self harm scars visible. I really understand where she’s coming from, and I would absolutely hate it if someone were to see them and become upset while I’m trying to serve them (I work as a cashier). We have to wear a T-Shirt as a uniform, but are permitted to wear a long sleeve shirt under it if we want. She says that I simply can’t go to work with my scars showing, and that she won’t let me go into work without a long sleeve shirt.

I can’t help but feel that she is making me feel guilty about something I already struggle to feel comfortable about, and that she is shaming me for the very real pain my mental health causes me. I also feel that I would hate to upset people with my scars, and would prefer to cover them up (as I have meticulously in the past), but the fact is that it is extremely hot where I live, and it simply isn’t functional to wear two layers of clothing all day.

So… am I the asshole? Should I just suck it up and do the right thing, and wear a long sleeve shirt even though it causes me great discomfort from the heat, because I am responsible for the mistakes I’ve made, and I need to be extremely careful for how my scars might effect others? Or is my mum being hurtful and unsupportive?

742,I think I had an anxiety attack,"Full disclosure; I (24M) have been going through a stressful patch lately. This last week specifically has been hard, and in general I've felt muted, clouded and physically tense - hyperaware of every little twitch, strain and faulty fine motor movement. I've also had a dull tension or tightness in my chest for much of the day, coupled with more laboured breathing off/on. Well all of that may have culmulated tonight as while I was laying in bed, the breathing began to flair up. I walked upstairs to the bathroom, sat on the toilet and tried to calm myself. My breathing got more panicked, though, and the only thing I thought to do was grab my house robe, lie on the bathroom floor and hope it passed. I did just that and was basically gasping for air for the next 1-2 minutes. When I finally got back up, I ran my head under some cool water and it all seemed to tone itself down. It's now been 30+ minutes, and after a drink and some relaxing internet clips I seem to be back to normal.

I must admit, however, that its still gives me pause. I've had some panicky moments in the past, but this was something new and unexpected. I hope it doesn't happen again the future, but I guess more importantly, I hope I won't be by myself if it does.",1678596132.0
743,I'm unemployed and want to stay depressed. How do I fix this? Please share your thoughts.,"I'm 24 years old. I've been depressed for about 8 years.

I've  been unemployed for the past year and have just stayed at home (parents  divorced, living with mother) while living off savings that are slowly  running out. When I think about it, it sounds pathetic but really all I  do is play video games, consume content, take a lot of naps, and  generally do anything I can to distract myself from the reality of my  life. Mentally, I feel at the capacity of a teenager. Recently I've  started to apply for jobs to not feel like such a deadweight. I even  applied to university to finish my degree and got accepted part-time  this fall, but my heart isn't really in to it. Over all these years I've  never had the courage or care to get professionally diagnosed or see a  therapist. I'm trying to figure out why.

I  would describe my experience as baseline being a completely null and  apathetic existence, but when I hit a mood swing I become so depressed  it's crushing. Yesterday was the worst mood shift out of the blue that  I've felt in a long time. I was in bed the entire day, crying about the  outcome of my life, and actively thought about jumping off the balcony  for several hours.

I feel like I need a wake up call, or validation, or someone to point me the right way forward.

I  woke up today and thought about how I need to get my life started and  even get in to therapy. My family have been as understanding as they can  be, but I'm starting to get pressured to get a job and get my shit  together. Sometimes they're the only reason I'm still alive, but I have a  hard time getting them to understand how much I'm suffering, what I'm  feeling, and that I'm not just being lazy.

I  was trying to ask myself why I haven't been working for the past year  and why I didn't care about it. I used to be employed at a grocery store  for 3-4 years and even got promoted a few times. I hated that job and  dealing with people all day long. Every time I went in I was reminded of  how my life did not turn out the way I intended and it made me so  irritable and anxious to go in. I met my best friend there and he felt  the exact same things I did, it's how we bonded. He killed himself in  2020. My family moved countries two years ago and when we arrived here I  got a job as a delivery driver for about a year. I thought it would be a  good idea - I would generally be by myself and would get to learn the  area better. I was actually fired from that job because I had severe  anxiety attacks while driving several times. I hated every second of  what I was doing and how it brought no value to my life or future and it  made me so upset/anxious I would hyperventilate and nearly faint.

I  think I realized that maybe I'm exhibiting these behaviors and have  distracted myself for years because I'm trying to protect myself. I feel  like if I have to go through the motions, work at another dead-end  minimum wage job, and do the correct things to fix my life that I'm  going hate it so much I will end up killing myself. I will be depressed  whether I'm unemployed or making minimum-wage. Hell, people are  depressed and kill themselves when they have made millions and millions  of dollars. I view my depression and behaviors as a way to ""save myself""  from suicide.

What do you guys  think about this relationship with my symptoms? Do I go in to therapy?  Do I just suck it up and get any job? Do I get diagnosed and/or apply  for disability?

I'm really  frustrated that I can't seem to make any progress. I don't want to  continue living this way for the rest of my life, but I don't know how  to get there. I want to treat the root cause of all the problems in my  life. Anytime I think about being successful and stable and in control  of my life I feel like an impostor. When I was younger I did really well  in school and had high hopes for my future. I don't know the steps I  need to take to get back on that path.

If  any of you relate to these feelings or have healed from them, I'd love  to hear your thoughts. If there's something wrong with how I'm thinking I  will also appreciate being called out for it.",1678571172.0

746,feeling stuck,"Hello! I am an 18 year old Eastern European graduating high school. I am currently graduating from two schools, Gymnasium and music school. However, for the past year or so, I have been struggling a lot with mental health and getting myself to do work. Throughout my education, I have always been a model, straight A student and very dedicated to my studies. Right now, I am graduating, swamped with exams and tests, I have a graduation concert coming up, as well as  graduation tests and I want to study medicine, so add MCATS on top of that. Fortunately, my grades are still straight A's as I have somehow managed to hold them up, but if I keep this tempo up, they are going to sink. I am unable to get myself to study, as I get distracted VERY easily and my concentration span is very weak. This led to physical and mental issues where I am constantly depressed and anxious, spending my days in bed dreading my existence. I know time is passing by and that I should do something about my life, but I keep letting myself down and I feel like I am in too deep and there's no hope for me and my success.

Me and my family don't really get along because they can be passive-aggressive pretty often and all conversations feel tense. They were physically abusive years ago and I honestly preferred it over emotional toxicity. Idk if that sounds stupid as hell or🙄

But honestly like, why should I fucking care? Yeah I'm pretty emotionless sinceee 2020? Maybe. There's just nothing to really emote about. Yesterday was a numb day. Today's been a numb day. Online school is hard af and I barely care.

Yeah my friends don't like talking to me recently because I'm just the fucking weird guy who ruins the vibe. Idk how to get excited like they do.

Yeah I don't talk at all, like ever. But why care?? I don't really feel passionate about anything right now except... Idk hopefully getting into UNI. Gym's a nice place to escape to. Ehhhh, who cares.

And last and probably least, yeah I prefer to go to places alone even if it's a public place with potentially dangerous evilness. Like what do I care? Is someone gonna stab me? Please do. Kill me, just please please do it. I don't know what the point of waking up today was. I guess to do online school and... realize how much more likely this course is gonna fail.

751,I messed up so badly,"And all I can do is go over and over my bad decision.  And lecture myself how I could have done it right, and relive it in my head and project forward how it would be, and see over and over the reel of the moments I messed it up, and every now and then be forced to check into reality where everything is hopeless and awful and ruined because of what I’ve done.  And everything in the present is not only ruined because of my bad decision, (in which I acted less than honorably so lots of shame), but I’m also ruining the present by being obsessed, depressed and mentally ill surrounding this and I can’t break free. And literally everything as it is now is a trigger to how it could have been.  So I shout no all the time and mumble the thoughts I should have had that would have prevented my making the bad decision over and over again. And I know all the can’t go back, have to move forward but there is no forward for me. No joy. And I do this in front of my kids and I ruined it for my kids - and I can’t do it, can’t go on, but I can’t leave them either but I’m no good for them. Incidentally the decision is not life or death but it feels that way.  I went back on a house I said I’d rent that would have been perfect for some unknown self sabotage reason, rented one that is bad, and triggers me in every way for what I should have done.  I can’t be there, don’t want to be there so I’ve just been living with the kids at my ex’s, their dad, who we don’t get along and he doesn’t want me here but he’s letting me and trying to help me get well (even though I can’t because I can’t get the past back) at the same time as verbally abusing me and everything is awful but it could have been so good, and I don’t see the point or feel capable of going on and I am ashamed of myself and I can’t face people, and I’m just laying on the couch essentially willing myself to die. There is no hope. And if you’ve read this thanks for listening. I realize how insane I sound because I am.  The feeling is unbearable.

I want to get better… really, I do. I’m trying. But as dumb as I feel like it sounds, I’m so alone. I’ve managed to make some new acquaintances recently, but I’ve forgotten how to bond with people. I remember it used to come so naturally, but now? It’s like a forgotten language. 

I’m still a person… I think. I still have interests, and I’m trying to pick up my old hobbies again. Maybe I don’t really have goals right now, but I think they’ll come back as I get better. That’s what people say will happen, anyways. It’s just that… all those things I don’t or barely have are the things people bond over, aren’t they? So if I have no aspirations, barely work on hobbies, and only have a few odd interests like movies and psychology, how am I supposed to get close to anyone? Is there another way?

How do I get to know people? How do I let them get to know me? How can I, when the last few years of my life are just as depressing to hear about as they were to live out?

764,(30M) How to cope with being unwanted because ugly?,"(posted this in Dating a little while ago)

So, this is a weird thing to post, as I really don't know what to do, but it's weighing me down and nobody seems to give any constructive help. I have tried posting on similar forums, but have had very little constructive help, mostly people don't seem to read this and understand the problems I am explaining.

Up top, I have no issues with shyness or anxiety, never had a problem talking to women or issues with confidence etc.

In short, I'm male, 30 years old, 5ft 10, 170lbs, I'm in fairly athletic shape. I rent in a city, and am fully employed. In my spare time I enjoy a range of hobbies, such as; going to the gym, swing-dancing, photography, meeting friends, going to bars & clubs. I've also joined some social ""meet-up"" groups designed to help meet new people. All of that is great, I love the things that I do, and I make friends very easily from them. I honestly feel lucky to have curated such a wonderful bunch of people from different walks of life, a healthy mix of male and female, older and younger, married and single. I'm very social, my problem is that I cannot get a girlfriend, and it's becoming increasingly apparent to me that my looks are the issue.

Look, I know that ""nobody's ugly!"" and all the Hallmark card stuff, but at this point I cannot put it down to anything else. This is not some random theory I've come up with, I have been told this many times over the years. Honestly, I think I'm somewhere in the range of 'average', don't we all? Sadly, the single women of the world have a different opinion. I have been told many times that I'm ugly, and though I don't believe it, it does seem like the general consensus. Tinder is the obvious yardstick: women are shown a picture of me with no clue as to how what job I have, my confidence levels, my religion, my politics, literally nothing other than ""is this person attractive?"" and seeing as I've never had a match on there, the answer must be ""no"". I'm on all the other usual suspects as well, Hinge, Bumble etc. Other people have said this either about me, or sometimes to me. I live in a big city, it is odd to never ever get a match. I take care in the photos I put up, it's not hard. I had a friend try to tell me that it must be something I'm saying wrong, and that he could get me date within a week using online dating. I took him up on his challenge, he could say whatever he wanted, just had to use photos of me. 2 months later with no dates, he gave up.

But of course, online is not the only way to meet people. Like I said, I do a range of activities that are very easy to meet a partner, and many do through these channels. I have known many single women actively looking for a man, but any suggestion I make of us getting to know each other better is quickly brushed aside. I will also get the ""I'm not looking for a relationship"" line from people, which is betrayed when they show up a few weeks later with an attractive person on their arm. I've even went speed dating, events where single women literally pay money to meet a man; at these events I've had really good times talking to people, felt relaxed, and walked away feeling good about myself. Then the next morning I find that out of 12 women, all of them ticked 'no' for me. Again, I can't see how it could be a confidence issue when I don't feel un-confident.

I'm having a hard time getting people to believe me. My friends certainly don't, as much as they give the cartoonishly supportive line of ""something will come along soon, just you wait!"", it would be more convincing if they hadn't been saying it since 2012. Thing is, they've all had a completely different lived experience. They're pretty people: they had their first relationships in their teens, then a couple of semi serious ones in their early 20s, then they got married with 2.4 kids and a Labrador. Whereas I'm 30 and never even had a Valentine's Day card. I feel very 'behind' everyone else. They literally do not understand the words I am saying when I tell them that women want nothing to do with me, because they've never had that experience. It makes me sad that as much as I do enjoy my life as it is, I'm getting the impression that... this is it; I will just work during the week, fill my evenings and weekends with hobbies and friends, and that's all my life will be until I die.

Statistically it's unheard of to make it to 30 without having a single relationship, I've never met anyone with that issue. I have had a couple of one-night-stands when I was in my early 20s, but I'm very aware they only happened with copious amounts of alcohol, in the sober light of day each person dropped me very quickly.

It makes me feel there's really nothing to look forward to in life. As in, I don't see the point in working really hard to buy a house, so I can be ugly & unwanted in walls that I own. I'm happy with my job, and it pays fairly well, but that's not something that's obvious to the naked eye when I'm in a bar scenario.

I don't know, but seemingly nobody else seems to. I don't know what I hoped to achieve writing this here, but I'm just out of ideas. I'm very sure many will skim-read this and come up with the usual ""you just need to believe harder!"" or ""have you tried meeting new people?"", to those who've read the whole thing and believe the words I'm saying, thank you.

I'm doing therapy and I read every book I can find, whether it is philosophy, psychology, neuroscience or spirituality. I keep a healthy lifestyle: 8 hours of sleep, exercise, eat healthy food, be social, etc.

I've come to realise that the trigger for that depression is external in the sense that certain things have happened to me, but it is profoundly internal for I am the one who has decided to pursue those relationships and trust and build dependency with people who were not ready or interested in it, and also the one who is clinging to that pain and not letting it go. I just feel sad and resentful and angry for those things. I was only caring and loving towards them, and they weren't.

It is not within my control that they have their issues and/or lack feelings towards me that I do have for them, even if it is their responsibility to be emotionally accountable. 

At the end of the day, nothing of this had happened if I had made good decisions. 

It is true that my father was overly critical, against emotions and failed to be there for me. Never calling to ask if I was okay, wishing happy birthday and the usual social conventions. It is true that my mother struggled to provide a stable environment. It is true that my brother also left the house when I was 6 and failed to call to see if I was okay, to support me at school when boys would come to beat me or to reciprocate emotionally when I was affectionate towards him to create a bond. He has also failed to apologise for his mistakes (saying if it wasn't because I was there (on holidays) for a couple of days, he would hit me in the face) and completely divest on me. It is true that my father has potentially sexually abused me when I was a baby (my brother says he saw him caressing me down there displaying signs of pleasure) and maybe that's why I can't have penetration (whether from a man or just putting a tampon in, I genuinely fainted when I tried to put my first tampon on). Yet I still don't know if my dad actually sexually abused me and hence its impact.

All I know is that I have made all these terrible decisions and I've reached a point when I just don't want to live because it hurts too much. My belief system has shifted in such a way that it doesn't lead me to a positive outcome. Life truly is about suffering, it's inevitable. And to live for a moment of light in an ocean of darkness, especially when the darkness feels so intense and so constant, doesn't make sense. Joy is temporary while this profound sorrow and emptiness I feel is always there, lurking. 

I am very confused about everything in life. When my therapist says that I have been emotionally abused by my family I don't believe her. I can't get myself to say I've been abused. 

I just don't see a way out and I'm very tired.",1678400950.0
773,Hello I'm new,"Hey there just needing some advice. Me and my husband have been married for 3 years, we both love each other to bits and have been helping each other through the worse times....Today he got a letter from a counciling thing from the doctors. So I've put my point across that I'm not happy as I'm so proud of him and how far he's come. We've come so far together, and I just feel he goes here, we're back to square one. I'm trying to be supportive and I am but I feel so down about it too.....I'm sorry I just don't know where to turn as I really don't have anyone to talk to apart from him and it always end in a row.",1678422381.0
774,Depressed about work,"27f, I started working at a new job back last November. Things seemed to be going ok, but I’ve made more mess-ups and mistakes in four months than in all my past working life. I get so nervous thinking that “this mistake will be my last at this job,” or “how can I possibly recover from THAT?” I have been (unjustly) fired before. I know the saying that making mistakes helps you learn, but so far it has seemed like a series of pratfalls, scrapes bumps and all.

To make matters worse, I have two bosses who want to share my time by splitting me down the middle. The workload is INSANE. One is about to retire, so I suck it up, but he’s a heavy drinker and sometimes yells. He doesn’t tolerate anything but pure perfection, and even then things take numerous revisions and scoldings before he’s anywhere close to happy with my work. I have had one serious panic attack. I’ve burst into tears and sobbed (in FRONT of my bosses) from the pressure and stress MULTIPLE times. I’m having memory and focus issues (ADHD, quite possibly), but every time I ask for help from my bosses I get trodden on and ridiculed.

I’m getting to the point where I don’t even feel I have any worth, I suck at my job and I’m not qualified for anything that pays better. I can’t look at job boards without self-deprecation. I’ve been depressed before, but not like this. I keep thinking about quitting the job for my mental health!

Does anybody have life tips to give, ideas to share, solutions for improving my career or outlook on life? Am I blowing things out of proportion? I could really use another persons perspective.

776,Severly disabled but here's how I turned my life around.,"As silly as it may sound to non-anime fans, it started with my hero academia.  
As someone who's had hundreds of dislocations from EDS and has CPTSD from it, I really related to dekku.  


I found inspiration from him initially, being quirkless in a world where everyone has an advantage over you and life doesn't give you breaks.  


I started exercising while watching it, then I found anime rap songs that deeply explain suffering of all facets.  


I stopped listening to anything that wasn't going to push me forwards and made a playlist of anime songs (like from fabvl, he's amazing).  


I ended up coming across David Goggins and I've been obsessed ever since.  


Finally a male role-model that also is learning-disabled, has been through extreme abuse and learned self-discipline - managed to come out on the other side stronger.  


I've battled severe major depressive disorder and am resistant to all but 1 medication, I've tried hundreds over the years going back to a child.  


After watching nothing but goggins 24/7 I started getting on a cycle bike, despite the possibility of one or more dislocations.  


My first time I went 1 hour, my second I had an asthma attack but fought past by controlling my breathing and went on to do 2 hours.  


I learned about Andrew Huberman from the Rich Roll podcast, started watching videos on how to optimize my health and gain.  


I found Wim Hoff and started doing cold showers, it should be noted that you're not supposed to do his breathing while in a cold exposure as it's killed people.  


His breath work is separate from cold exposure.  


Now my max tolerance for cortisol is much higher.  


I went from 100 LBS to 138.  


I'd like to link some videos to go along with what I'm talking about.  


Anyways, I've been stranded on the floor for 5 hours from dislocations when I was younger.  
I've nearly KMS multiple times, I've had hundreds of dislocations so if I can do it anyone can.  


The first step is accountability, stop making excuses.  


Someone could have ruined your life, but if you're still there obsessed over it then you won't get anywhere. Pick the pieces up and start over.",1678394274.0

781,1 poem. 2 endings. A battle of the mind for supremacy.,"The words flow uninterrupted in my mind, but stop short of my lips. I bite my tongue to avoid conflicts. I cannot confront, but nor can I abide. What more can I do? What will my mind allow? This I do not know. 

Words flow from the pages to fill my soul, though my soul can never be sated, nor satisfied. I ravenously absorb every piece, of every word, and though it transports me for a time, it is never for long enough.
The words are an escape. An escape from brutal reality. It may be only a temporary reprieve, but the absence of reality is sometimes the only solace I am able to get from the concept we call life.

The pages of books are my home. My prison that I freely walk into to be shut away from the horrors of the world. To be trapped in a different world each night of my own choosing. For it allows me to express. To freely let the emotions flow without accepting the feelings as my own.

**Words have always been my refuge. They have been my rock. They have anchored me to this mortal coil, and to the dirt beneath my feet. They have yet to lead me astray as long as i put my soul into them. And my very essence shall one day be put into the old pages of the books so beloved by me


**{Alt.}

Words have always been my refuge. They have been my rock. They have anchored me to this mortal coil, and to the dirt beneath my feet. Yet anymore, they are not enough. Falling short, no longer able to cross the chasms of scars, and oceans of agony. The days of Subjective Reality are gone.

782,Haven’t felt right for a long time,"I live in rural Canada with my mom and dad, I’m a 20 years old guy. Over the last 5 years my dad’s sight has progressively degenerated and due to the hold up with covid we essentially lost 2 years on getting a diagnosis on what has been going on with him. He’s essentially been diagnosed with dementia, but the tar has formed in the parts of his brain that help him see. This has been incredibly hard to deal with as a family. The emotional distress of seeing him in the shape he’s in, getting lost in the dark, not being able to cook or work (he was an amazing carpenter his whole life), needing to change the channel for him on the tv and help him put on his hoodies, I still haven’t wrapped my head around everything. When he was working we were hanging onto middle class but now with him not working and having no pension and the economy gone to shit we’re very destitute. I left trade school after my girlfriend cheated on me after dating for almost 2 years. I feel like her cheating on me was the straw that broke my back, that was 4 months ago and I’m still crying every night and thinking about her all the time. I don’t know what to do sometimes. I know I had suicidal thoughts from a very young age (12 if I recall) so maybe I’m predisposed to the blues, but it feels like I’ve never been happy my entire life. I starting smoking weed in high school and it’s now been a daily thing for years, ounce a week for the last 6 months. I know I need therapy but any sort of thing like that is an hours drive away at least. My whole life I’ve been told by older people “man if only I could relive those years” “you don’t know how lucky you have it, how great life is and how much it will suck later”
Sometimes i start thinking about if life sucks now when I’m supposed to be happy how terrible will things be when things are supposed to be shitty. I don’t know, I know I won’t kill myself just because I truly love my family, but I often think about wishing I was never born, really wishing my life was over somehow or never existed or maybe just be someone else.

I am now at the point where I feel better off alone but I don’t want to be alone.

I am going to be 38 later this year. Living 36 years without any kind of impairments to then suddenly be thrust into a disabled life and needing to readjust everything I know and learned has already driven me completely mad.

I cannot do the activities I used to be able to do like snow/skateboard, play the drums, go hiking with my gf and dog(she left and took my pup with her), and a plethora of other things like mma training or waking without cane.

As of late I have found myself less attracted to the things I used to do (I.e Play guitar, gaming, singing, etc) I don't know why I feel like this, but I think that it could be due to the fact that I have fallen in love. She's super awesome and cool, she respects my boundaries and genuinely cares about my well being, but while not saying this directly to my face, I can sometimes hear her talk about how she isn't interested in dating. It's really discouraged me from asking her out, but that is besides the point. Recently I scared her. I did a dumb thing in front of her and I didn't realize that she was there until it was too late. Later she has some choice words for me that not only upset me because she was the one to say it, but also because everything she said was true. The past few weeks I have been beating myself up about this, and I fear that I am pushing those who I genuinely care about away from me with my neglect towards their feelings in the moment. Now back to the first thought, I am rarely suicidal.

But the thing is the world has rejected me. The world has told me again and again that I am not welcome. The world has failed me again and again. If the world doesn't want me why should I want this world. 

My relationships? Practically zero. Everybody claims they are my friends but I never get invited anywhere. I DM people and never get a reply back. The moment someone seems to find an opportunity they don't bother backstabbing me to get ahead. Who can I trust. In the name of love all i get is paid lust. The only thing people care about, atleast the people I know is their own happiness and own pleasure. I am done trying to provide them the pleasures. 

My career? Practically fucked. I did pull sleepless nights, scored good grades, won case comps, prepared for interviews, did more live project and certification than anyone in the batch. What's my prize for the effort? Lowest salary in the entire batch. No company wanted to hire me and wouldn't even tell why I am a bad candidature. It was hard seeing everyone getting placed and no company bothering with me. I don't know how I pulled through that blow. I just can't anymore. I became a stoic but I guess I couldn't be fully. All these straight AAs that I keep getting are just a mockery of me i feel. 

I never had a childhood. All spent behind nothing but studies. Not only was there poverty but also bullying from everyone be it relatives or colleagues. The traumas became fear which is affecting me further. My only escape was porn from which I have lost all interest now. I never did drugs, alcohol etc but now I think that would be a great escape. There is no prize for leading a honest life but depression.

I am 25 now I don't want to know what horror lies ahead for me. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I am my parents only son. I don't want to suffer anymore.

793,Non conventional motivation,"(21M) I have a very unique situation that’s taken it’s toll on my life, and still does. 
My younger sister suffered a stroke at birth, resulting in paralyzation on her right side & brain damage, and using a wheelchair to get around. I have two brothers, one younger, one older. The older refusing any responsibility w/ her at all so I had to spend my free time at home, becoming the weird, quiet kid at school. I’d get bullied and my brother would jump in on it, anything to get more attention from people. Trying to keep this short though. But, despite all of that, I met the perfect girl toward the end of middle school. Yes, middle. I’m confident we would’ve gotten married if we had met a few years later. I still had some learning to do about myself, and her parents were super controlling, and because of a mix of those two things, she broke things off and blocked me, b/c it hurt her. We didn’t see each other for a few years, and she moved on from me completely, even as friends when I saw her again. 
Still, without her part in my life, I don’t think I’d be here. She’s married now, and I’m happy for her. Even if things didn’t turn out well for us, of course she deserves that. Recently though, I’ve been stewing over what could’ve been, over my screwups, and the mess of my life. Now, when I think of motivation, I think of her, be the man she would’ve been proud of, and I use that to move forward, w/ or w/o her. 
If I try to talk to my mother about anything, she turns it on herself & plays victim. My father is too tired to care + always takes her side. I’ve had no one to talk to for a couple years now, so here I am putting it on the internet to strangers, so I guess I wanted to see what people’s thoughts were, whether or not that’s a sick form of motivation to use. 
It’s already long as it is, and I tried to keep it short, so I can elaborate on things if need be.

[6.march] this was the worst yet did you notice that i wrote yet ? Because it will get worse that's it for today.

[March 7. Night 00:28] [Note] i was thinking about why im depressed and want to kill myself......maybe that life is the same everyday and nothing makes me happy even if i try new things? Why live if i won't make a change in the world? Why live if i can never find happiness? Why live if i will be alone and lonely forever? Why live even though I'm ugly and i hate the way i was born i hate my race everyone is racist(one of the most racist countrie's in eu) i hate it! I hate the way i was born i won't make a change in the world. Why do i continue to try... Why live even though everyone's fake i always get left out out of everything literally.
Why live even though I will never succeed in life, and I'm gonna be suicidal forever, i don't want to fight anymore, i want to jump of the balcony, i want to take every pill in the house, and overdose but i dont my mom to be in pain. And probably everyone hates me. Why won't it FUCKING end what's so great about living? I've got the answer absolutely nothing. I wish a big meteor would hit the Earth and destroy everything here so no pain would exist again. I just wish everyone would just forget about me or that i was never born.... But that's not possible.... I hate myself so fucking much. I think that's it...




Edit 1: [March 7 night 1:14]these are some things i forgot about. The depression made me loose my appetite. I think about killing myself 24/7. I wanted to cry so much but i can't when I want to cry my throat and chest hurts. And i probably have insomnia because every i can't fall asleep until 5:30 or something like that, on March 6 i got literally 2 hours of sleep. And i met a girl on a site she was struggling with depression because her ex made her feel like everything was her fault i helped her and she recovered, BUT now it looks she isn't there for me and dosent care about me like everyone else. I don't even remember the last i smiled (the real one i always fake my smile so no one will get noticed how I feel). I'm a burden for my parents I'm a waste of money i should kill myself i hate everything in life.
 I should go back to sleep

795,Profound loneliness and suicidal ideation,"(26M) I'm finding that life is just becoming more and more lonely, and it's taking what feels like an irreversible toll on my mind. I work in an office with just two people, both twice my age and whom I can't connect with on a personal level. The friends I'd made at my last job, people actually my age, all but stopped inviting me to hang out like they had been. My longtime friends are hundreds of miles away now or have all gotten engaged/married and are occupied with real adult things, and I'm stuck playing third wheel. I wouldn't care about the stigma of being a virgin, having never kissed someone, having never even properly dated anyone, but the societal pressure to find a romantic partner is so suffocating and inescapable. So I try and try and fail and fail, and at this point, I'm completely resigned to the rejection it always ends in, without fail.

At this point, it's just leading to greater and greater suicidal ideation. I daydream when I'm driving about how easy it would be to swerve off an overpass when driving on Interstate, when I'm in a tall building how I could take just one step off the edge of the roof. I'm starting to think that the inevitable day will involve huffing enough carbon monoxide to pass out and leave this world peacefully, and I've put basic thought into what kind of message I'd want to leave behind. I don't think it's a matter of ""if,"" it's a matter of ""when."" I know telling people this means I should expect a lot of ""it gets better' sentiments, but I've lived nearly three decades, and that sure as hell doesn't seem to be true",1678315266.0
796,Feeling hopeless,"A year ago, I was living my best life.

However, while I was enjoying my time so much, at the back of my head, I knew that me and my family will be moving to another country (moving for my father’s job). I dreaded the moment I will have to leave, however, I did a decent job dealing with it. Unfortunately, the time came, and ever since August, I’ve been living the worst life. I haven’t found any friends with common interests, I go home every time after school, I spend the weekends at home, and it just seems.. hopeless. I look at my snap memories and I can’t believe certain things happened a year ago already, it just seems like a week ago. Day by day I get more depressed since I feel like the situation is unfixable and I will never find the happiness I had a year ago. Has anyone experienced anything similar? I’m just looking for any way out, and I don’t even know who to ask anymore. My parents try to help me and I appreciate it, but their efforts are useless.

798,Losing pleasure in all the things you enjoy,"I guess I'm looking for advice from someone who's found a way to start enjoying the things they lost interest in again. 

I'm 18 and a year ago was doing really well, I never knew what I wanted to do exactly in the future, but I had interests, subjects I enjoyed and planned to go on pursuing. Recently it's like everything has collapsed in on me. So quickly I've turned into the opposite of what I used to be. I've isolated myself, have no interest in seeing my friends or making new ones. I don't have a job or any kind of activity to take up my time, and I can never bring myself to find something, or if I do, I never go through with it, like somethings stopping me. I can't seem to think of anything I enjoy or want to pursue and I can't see anything good in my future it just seems hopeless. I'm supposed to be going to university this september but I don't know if I can do it anymore, I can't tell if it's just not what I want anymore or if I'm just re thinking things because I'm in a bad place.

If anyone else has ever gone through this and come out the other side please could you offer any tips for how you started to find yourself again. Anyone I have spoken to in my life doesn't seem to understand, they tell me to just think positive and basically tell me I can control the way I see things but it really doesn't feel that way. I almost feel like I've lost every sense of who I am and it's probably at the worst time because right now I'm expected to make huge decisions about my life and future. 

sorry this is so long, thank you to anyone who can help.",1678293827.0
799,Help with issue needed,"Hi all, looking for advice for an issue, there's a bit of a back story so bare with me.

A year and a half ago I met a guy who I'll refer to as Z. We quickly started dating but after around 6/8 weeks we stopped as it was obvious there were things that weren't working, however as we were really good together we decided to remain friends.

This was all fine, we had ups and downs like any friendship but we got on really well together and had plenty of good times, helped and supported each other etc. During the Summer of 2022, Z was suffering from a health issue so I tried to support as much as I could, but they weren't telling me how I could support them so I was essentially guessing.

At this point I should say that I suffer with a mild form of Autism, which affects my ability to recognise some social cues/situations etc. Z was aware of this and we spoke about it.

From around October 2022 I started to develop feelings for Z again. At first I was trying to fight it as I only wanted to be friends but it became clear I couldn't do this as they were real. In December I told Z about how I felt and asked if they wanted to try again however they did not which I respect and understand.

From then on things seemed to be strained, we didn't communicate or see each other as much though this was linked to Z's health issues which were causing him issues. In mid-January Z pulled out of seeing me for the 2nd time in a couple of weeks. As I was still processing the earlier feelings this left me upset and I told him this. Z then responded with a long message with a lot of hurtful comments. That was the last message I received from him, nearly 2 months ago.

The message made me feel like a monster and while I don't agree with how it was said, I understand his feelings. He wasn't well at the time and I made the situation about me, so he felt like disregarded him which makes me feel awful. I also put way too much pressure on him to see me, when he had issues himself. The fall out from everything for me has ended up with being diagnosed with depression.

To further complicate matters, Z has a mutual friend who I am very close with and he is now seeing them more than ever since we stopped talking.

I appreciate it's a lot, but has anyone got any advice how I can deal with this going forward? I don't know if I'll ever talk to Z again to fully understand things and this hurts a lot. It was also my birthday Monday to which I of course had nothing from him which hurt some more.

If you've read all this, thank you, and any help would be appreciated.",1678279734.0
800,I really need advice whether I should reach out to my 10 year+ ex to apologize,"It's been bothering me for years. I dated this very down to earth, understanding, loving, caring woman for nearly 3 years. Mind, this was over a decade ago now. She was no doubt the type of woman any one with half a brain in their head would know they hit the jackpot having. However, I met her when I was 19, and mostly dated when I was in the first years of my 20's (she is 5 years older than me). I was a self centered, cheating, lying, narcissistic asshole. I ended up leaving her for someone I was seeing on the side. I put her through so much pain, made her believe lies, then tossed her aside like trash. It's been a long time since then, I've grown up and have taken my long hard look in the mirror, and lived in my deep well of shame to kill the narcissist that I was. I've wanted to reach out to her to say that my actions were beyond disgusting, and not a single moment of it was her fault, but I haven't. I have always thought it'd be better and more respectful to her if I just let her live without having to see or hear my name again, as she's even been married and had children since then.  I don't want to make it sound as if I want to be with her again or still have feelings for her, I genuinely only want to acknowledge the pain and trauma I caused her and to just say I'm sorry. So my question is, should I reach out and try, or am I doing the right thing by letting her live without trying to pop back up?  I feel guilty for wanting to disturb that.",1678279501.0

802,I have a problem with telling lies about myself,"I've always had this problem. My self-esteem is all over the place, but no matter how I feel, I'm always making little lies and exaggerating the truth about myself to others to make myself look better. Why do I do this? It's not very clear to me. Maybe I'm just worried that people don't like me or that I haven't achieved enough. Or maybe I just want everyone to see me as a cool person. Sure, for the most part, it works and boosts my self-esteem, but only for a while. I don't want to be ashamed of who I really am. I know these lies are pointless to make in the end.

Friends of mine are worried I’ll die, they still haven’t understood me. 

No one understands me anymore to be honest. I wish someone did, then at least I wouldn’t feel alone. 
I don’t know what will end up of my existence, but I know what it means so far.. I’m not satisfied with it. I want my life to mean something but I don’t know if I have the will or drive to do that either. I’m just stuck. It’s been a few days since I had a single meal.. 30hours since I got out of bed, and yet I couldn’t just give up. I hoped I could just die. But here I was.. don’t know why but I got out of bed, shivering, literally on the verge of passing out, ate a can of raw chickpea and drank half a liter of milk. I hate that meal but my body needed those calories. Cause anything else would have taken more than 5mins to prepare and I knew I did not have that luxury. Ate it up, away from bed. Still shivering but I guess not gonna to die! 
I don’t know what to do or what I’m gonna do next.. this is a new low in my life.. years of thinking I’m past that low but I keep hitting new extremes. Every time getting out of that like a automated machine that can’t allow itself to die. don’t tell me I should be proud of myself to have pushed out of bed and ate something cause I am not. I’m mad at myself for not being able to just let go. I’m mad at myself to have touched that low and not fucking accept it. I know I’m not that person who could just give up, but I also don’t know who I am. I’m a dilemma in the form of a person.

804,All of my old friends have better lives than me,"It's not that I wish for them to be miserable, I know I should be happy for them even if we're not friends anymore. It's just that knowing this, it feels like it only reinforces that the problem is me, especially since they're similar to me in ways.

Except they're out with friends, smiling, laughing, and making jokes, while I'm sitting here, alone as always, feeling miserable all the time, paranoid and untrusting of people, and just being a general failure of a person in every single way conceivable.

I don't even have anyone to tell this to so I'm telling Reddit. I have a therapy session tomorrow, which is great and all, but I can't help but feel like there's no fixing me. I hate myself so much, I hate my life and everything about it. I hate that I have to live with myself, with my life, I hate my personality and my shortcomings, and my positives don't make up for shit.

I would give anything to have a different life, I would trade lives with literally anyone I see. I regularly fantasize about living someone else's life, even if it sucks. Having memories of talking to peers and being able to go outside at all during childhood is automatically 100x better than my current life, as well as being able to be someone other than me.

There are no positives about the way I was raised and the way it damaged me. I'm not even strong enough to overcome it, I just lay around feeling sorry for myself because I'm so incapable of everything. God, I fucking hate myself.",1678222749.0

806,feelin shitty about employment,"I was born with many issues that have kept me from managing regular employment.  I'm fully an adult, and in the age range where being unemployed is pretty rare. Ive been dealing with it for years in therapy, but my self esteem has not gotten much better.  I know that I'm not alone, and the cards that ive been dealt are not my fault. Because I am so hard on myself, I am constantly beating myself for ""not trying hard enough"", but I also don't know when to allow myself to rest. The resulting anxiety from that mindset makes me crash and I am unable to do any hard tasks, all while never actually letting myself rest at all. I'm just in bed, overwhelmed with FOMO and shame, literally vibrating with anxiety. 
I am very fortunate to be getting SSI but I often wonder if that has trapped me? I feel very much for those of us who are unable to get that and I don't always believe that I deserve it. When I can, I do fill my time with healthy things like exercise, but depression has stolen precious things from me like my motivation to create art. On top of all this I also have autism and adhd which i believe is making my progress even slower. I'd kill to be creating a life for myself that I value, but right now I just can't imagine getting there and my quality of life is simply not good enough. When I'm extra depressed, I believe that it is inhumane.
What's a big old loser like me to do? How do you manage your issues with motivation? Have any of you found a job you could manage? Any stories of progress you'd like to share? Those are usually very helpful for me.

I was adopted into an emotionally sexually and physically abusive family. Left when I was 16 was a homeless teen dealt with assault and poverty. Met my ex fiancé when I was 21 he came from wealth. We bought a house together we got engaged I couldn’t really hang onto a job though. We started a small music career (I’d perform as a rapping drag queen he’d produce) and it was starting to gain traction before Covid. But when Covid came everything fell apart I called off the engagement because my partner was being self destructive and we’d already been having issues. He and his family quickly rejected me. I ended up having a pretty nasty suicide attempt after having an armed stand off with a white supremacist on my front lawn during BLM in St. Louis and dealing with the break up and loss of the stability and family I was creating. I decided to love to LA and been here for 2 years now. Started up my music career again but I never really get anywhere with it. Every traditional job I get ends up not being sustainable (currently filing a wrongful termination suit against the last office I was at for gross retaliation) but even then I feel like what’s the point. When I was young I used to tell myself I’ll get out of my parents house and their abuse when I was homeless I told myself I’ll be successful. Everything just goes in a loop and I end up at square one again.

He didnt get my any valentines gifts (my previous bf also never got me). He knew i would be sad as fuck but he didnt care. I wanted to break up many times before but he always told me it will get better. It only got worse each time. So i broke up.

i have no friends and work has been hard since i’ve been so fucking depressed. i cry constantly and even at work daily. people can tell i’ve lost the light i think im getting asked if i’m ok at work. they’re the only other people i interact with (my coworkers). i’ve always had such a hard time making friends and since i moved around a lot as a child i don’t have any old friends. i live fairly close to my parents but they’re the only family i have nearby the rest are like 800 miles away. i was definitely depressed before but it started after my bf and i broke up. 
he (20m) broke up with me a couple months ago after 1.5 years. he said it’s because hes going back to college and he said he needed to focus on his school and new friends and mental health. he was the only person in my life that i was comfortable with. we didn’t have a great relationship but after we broke up i realized how bad i was and how much i was willing to do more and be a better gf for him. i work full time and the hours just don’t fit. i realize we won’t work out and he’s not my person but i can’t help but hold on to him bc he was the only person i had in my life. and we still communicate and hang out sometimes but no matter what it gets ugly eventually. he gets aggressive because i poke and prod and we argue and both have our issues so it always ends badly. i still miss him though. he’s changing so much and i want to be there for him and to see that. i wanted us to get better together. i understand it’s not reasonable and he said he wants to grow up single so he can focus on himself and i agree but it’s hard that i’m the person he’s cutting out. 
as for for myself i’ve tried reaching out to acquaintances/friends but they just blow me off. last time i complained about my depression to my mom she didn’t help me bc she was depressed when she was young and got addicted to pills. she said she doesn’t want me to be like that. i haven’t really thought about killing myself but it just seems so much easier not to be here. i don’t want that though. i’ve lived this long and i want to see it get better, i really do. but on my weekend i have nothing to do and no one to hang out with. i have a pet bird and i neglect him honestly. he deserves so much more than me. but i can’t give him up. 
i just don’t know what else to do and every day is getting harder and harder. nothing interests me anymore and i’m trying. no shows movies seem good to watch or if they do they’re about relationships and how they’re working out or not working out. every little thing triggers me. i haven’t been eating. but not because i’m not hungry. some days i’m not but some days i just tell myself not to eat because truthfully i am definitely overweight. i do feel weak and the last meal i ate was egg whites with some toasts like two days ago. i had to go to my parents to eat because i haven’t gone grocery shopping in months. i guess i tell myself i don’t deserve the food but idk. i’m just weak. mentally and physically.
i did sign up for talkspace but the therapist like isn not getting back to me. it’s been two days because he doesn’t work on the weekend but i’ve been paying for the service for five days and no one has talked to me yet. like i walked out on my job yesterday (my friday) because it just became too much. my boss cares for his employees truly i think but he’s admitted he has a crush on me so i can’t talk to him like i was before. i’ve run out of places to go and i have too much pride to reach out to anyone else. i can’t do it.

So i tried to talk to my parents about quitting and starting to work, but both got mad and disagreed, which brought me to try to finish university, not for me but for them, to make them proud.

819,A different kind of therapy,"A different kind of therapy
Part one. 

So if you know me or follow me you know that I'm a big believer that everyone could benefit from going to some sort of therapy. In my years of going to therapy or having my girls in therapy, I realize that not all therapists is alike and not all therapists are the same. 

So recently as I was watching this documentary on Netflix called Stutz in which Jonah Hill Interviews his therapist, I realized that the things that he said were definitely not like any therapy I've ever seen or heard of but it made a lot of sense.

So he first starts by telling you it's like a pyramid. You have to take care of your body 1st.

This means exercise, eating right, and meditation. Getting into yourself will definitely get you out of your head and out of your depression. 

The 2nd part of the Pyramid is people.
When you're depressed you tend to push the people you love away. You want to be by yourself, crawl into a hole or underneath a blanket, and be all alone in your misery. But what he was saying is that it is then that you need to pull those people closest to you because any kind of human interaction is a positive thing.

The last thing he spoke about on the pyramid was yourself.
He went on to say one of the best tricks to get into your self-consciousness is writing. Writing is like a mirror to what your unconscious is feeling. You enhance your relationship with yourself by writing.
It's about increasing your life force to find out what you're passionate about.

The next part of this is called part X. It is the judgmental part of you. It's the invisible force that wants to keep you from learning and growing. It's the voice of impossibility, that is within yourself that tells you you can't do this or this is impossible and it creates a primal fear in human beings.

You have 3 aspects of reality: 
Pain, Uncertainty, and Constant work.

The highest creative expression for a human being Is to be able to create something new, in the face of adversity. The worse the adversity, the greater the opportunity.

You can't move forward without being vulnerable. You can't get past your failures without failing first.

So today my friends remember, there are many ways to get you to move on with your life. But you must first realize that you have to be the change you want to see. Check out part 2 tomorrow with more details on how to change your life.

We have a long distance relationship, so it's hard for me to monitor the situation closely. She doesn't take any advice I give her to change some of the situations that worry her, but still complains about them with me, along with saying stuff like ""I feel like a failure, I'm useless"" and so on.

I'm having a harder time supporting her, because of my mother's depression I get really triggered and that behaviour just makes me panick and brings back terrible memories. I also feel that all the weight of our relationship is on me, and that if I express some kind of negative feeling, it will spiral out of control because she'll take it as an attack or as if she's the cause. 

I don't want to end our relatioship, but as time passes I find less joy and support in it. Today she asked me by text to tell her everything I think about us, out of blue. I refused to talk about it be text, since I think it's a really easy way to start a fight and it should be discussed at least by phone. Did I do wrong? How can I support her?",1678190775.0

823,"Difficulty making decisions, need help breaking out of loop","Hello everyone, first of all let me say thank you for all the people in this subreddit for helping the people who need it most, you are truly lifesavers.

(Some background: I'm a 25 year old woman living in the Netherlands)

Since I was a kid I've struggled with (high functioning) depressive episodes. I am now 25 years old, just ended a year of therapy for my anxiety disorder and started antidepressants. I feel like in my personal life I have gotten closer to what I need to stay in balance, and am better able to accept my condition. Also I am currently being tested for several different diagnoses, including ASS, some anxiety disorders and PTSS. 

I started working as a consultant at a prestigious business firm 2 years back after graduating. I didn't know what to do with my career so I decided this job would give me the opportunity to look into different types of businesses and projects. This all started out ok, I was happy to start a new opportunity and working from home due to Covid made me feel less anxiety about the job. 

Little over a year ago some things in my personal life changed, I broke up with the boyfriend I had for 3 years with whom I lived together, it was a messy breakup that also cost me a few close friends. At that moment my brother was also suffering from severe ocd and was passively suicidal. (He is ok now fortunately) I took care of him by checking in with him everyday and convincing him to live another day. I was devastated, however I've always been a person who despite feeling depressed, kept working hard. So I kept working hard while I was slipping deeper and deeper into a depression. 

Last summer it snapped, I came back from a holiday and couldn't work anymore. I called in sick and didn't work for approximately 2 months. All I did was survive. Not working gave me time to heal from everything that happened, and realign with my values in life. Therefore, after those two months, I started to feel ok again in my personal life.

Then I had to start building up work again. First a few hours, until this point where I'm at 60% again. Everytime I increased the amount of hours I work I had small depressive episodes again of +/- 2 weeks. I realised that from the moment I started the job, I felt like I was living someone else's life. A couple weeks ago I therefore had to conclude that it is not possible for me to reintegrate into this job. The job is at a firm that is not in line with my values (only focused on profit) and I'd like to have a job where it feels more like I'm contributing to society. I feel this is necessary for me to get out of this depressive loop.

So now I'm here, silently applying for jobs, having to still work and reintegrate at my current job while feeling depressed a lot. I feel like a shell of myself. I need to make a decision:

1. Quit the job right now, live on my savings, costing me about 1600/month everything included (high rent, live in the city) I have savings of approx. 16k
Pros: rest, ability to focus on recovery
Cons: stress about money and job
2. Stay in the job and keep silently applying to jobs and hope I can get out quickly while surviving through my days.
Pros: no stress about money or finding a job quickly
Cons: not capable of recovery
3. Some other option?

I feel like both options have their good and bad sides, and give me anxiety in some way. Therefore I am asking you guys for advice, what would you do in my position? Do you maybe see other options? Should I talk to my boss about this? And what should I tell them?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to reply, I am forever grateful!

825,I can’t find any strategy that helps,"
So many strategies to improve yourself, little by little, over time just will not work for me. Not that I haven’t tried. But it’s also circumstantial too.

The big strategies are like, go out and talk to a couple strangers each day. Put yourself in positions where you can meet people. Nope. Not an option, not yet. I can’t even make eye contact with people. And I push myself to do these things every day anyways, and I get absolutely no benefit from it. I know this just doesn’t work for me.

So, we look at smaller shit like “think about all the people that helped you today” or “ask a friend to do something with you”. Little improvements here and there that are better for people that can’t work up any motivation. That would be great! Problem! I don’t have friends.

My biggest issue, the strongest fuel for my depression, is that I’m just horribly fucking lonely. I don’t have anyone. I haven’t had anyone. Most of my life has been spent painfully alone and now I don’t even know how to begin working on recovering from that. I’ve quite literally traumatized myself from this and every step forward I take, I get knocked 5 back.

I don’t know what to do. Nothing helps. I do these things and I see these things and I wish I could do more, but I can’t. I’ve been trying really hard to give some things a shot. I can journal and write about my day and force myself to list a couple good things that happened but it’s all overshadowed by the fact that I’m still completely alone. I can go out in public and watch people and at least show my face and get out of the house but it doesn’t matter. I don’t feel anything from it. Whenever I look at people all I can ever think is just how much I want to be in their place. How much I want to have what they have. It’s not quite jealousy, it’s that it reminds me what I’ve always wanted and what I’ve never been able to get. I’d give anything.

It’s counterintuitive, right? I want to be with people, so I go out, I see people, it makes me sad, it makes me anxious, I leave, nothing changes. Part of that’s my fault, but a bigger part of it is that so much shit stands in my way that I can’t do anything effective.

Every. Single. Time. I have looked for new things to try, it’s always under the assumption that you have someone to help you, or you have someone to appreciate. I don’t! There is nobody in my life that I interact with enough (not my choice!) to have this, even in the loosest sense. Where are strategies for people below rock bottom? 

Between this and meds not working it makes me feel so sick knowing that nothing helps. I’m positive I have treatment resistant depresssion at this point but the thought of waiting longer and trying more meds and waiting and waiting and waiting for something to work might kill me. And the more time I spend alone the more it hurts. But nothing helps and I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t have exhausted every option but a lot of them are getting really out of reach. 

My brain takes every opportunity to help myself and just crushes it before it can even do anything.

I don’t know. This turned into a rant. How are you supposed to recover when every strategy assumes you have something you don’t? Strategies for someone that needs something smaller than baby steps?",1678168960.0
826,How do I get better?,"Hey everyone.
So I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, or at least what I think is depression. Honestly it’s kinda shitty surprisingly and I want to get better. The only problem is is I don’t want people to know I’m depressed. I can’t tell any of my teachers or counselors because they’re mandated reporters and suicidal thoughts will get me attention. I don’t want to tell my friends because we’re all teenagers, plus I don’t want them to avoid me when they have a problem just because I’m suffering. And then I don’t want to tell my family because I don’t want to hear “it’s all in you’re head, you’re faking it, it’s cause of that phone.” Or worse, that they believe me. I exercise, socialize, I’m ‘active’ and I’m about to go to college. I should be excited but I’m more excited anytime I’m crossing an intersection, on the off chance I get isekaid.

Throwaway because partner knows main account.  
This is not my first rodeo, I survived abuse by my alcoholic ex husband, he whom cheated on me, raped me, hit me, abused me in every possible way. Anyways, I got out, took therapy and meds, got my life straight and cared for my kids. I started dating an old crush and he once said he thought drugs and depression meds were just the same, that resonated in me and while they seemed to help, i stopped taking them, i thought i was able to take life as it was, and for months, i was. Lately I seem to be going crazy, screaming at my kids, ( one of them was born from rape), stopped eating, stopped caring, always cranky, stopped doing stuff, and always creating problems out of nowhere with my partner, now he´s at his wits end with me and I feel like shit all the time, I feel suicidal, insomnia has kicked in, i just want to throw myself into oblivion, it feels like such a relief.I know this must sound so ridiculous to all of you, like it doesn´t even sound like it´s harsh or like I´m really struggling, lots of people sure are way worse than me, I´m just whining or something like that.It´s just i really want to die.

I had major childhood trauma I was left in crack houses my mom almost overdosed on drugs and my dad went into a coma from alchol I was severely beaten down for years and told things that a child should never have to hear this is just a start but I’ll save more for a later time. I currently work full time at a car wash trying to leave where I’m at right now. I have a amazing girlfriend who is the only person I care about at this moment. I have never been open about being depressed and have never told a doctor instead I have used every avenue I tried Kratom which helped but didn’t give me the “high” I was chasing I never really thought I had a problem till now because I never was hooked on illegal drugs at all. After kratom I doubt anyone know what this is my I tried something called phenibute it similar to something called gabapentin but like a dirtier medication it’s give you a huge euphoria that last almost all day but tolerance builds super fast which leads to having to take a huge amount. Well I learned the hard way and got hooked on it my tolerance did build and the withdrawal was awful and I couldn’t do it I kept taking it. I also would take my adderal with it which would only heighten the euphoria I would overtake my adderal to get immense happiness which led to me now having none left and now feeling so helpless and guilty. My girlfriend learned about my phenibute problem and told me if I didn’t quit she would leave me and I lied because I tried and couldn’t do that the withdrawal. Now someone anonymously sent her a message telling her I’m a addict and that she should leave me because I’m lying to her I have no idea who would know but I’m scared to death and have no idea what to do. I’m already suicidal and if I lose her I would definitely think about it.,1678160713.0

He lost his childhood cat in December and in late January his rescue kitten passed both of those deaths hit him hard. I supported him as well as I could I also told him neither of those were his fault. He has also been dealing with some financial difficulties since he got divorced over a 1yr ago. He’s on a ton of medication that are dosed pretty high. He has told me before that he hates the job he’s at (restaurant server) because he works nights and his boss won’t let him work in the AM he’s been there for 5yrs. He just got a second job so he could help pay debt. 

And last night he was just so done with everything he left work in the beginning of his shift turned his phone and left without letting anyone know. The day before he was telling me that he was cutting again and wanted to 51/50 himself or he might do something. I spoke to him and asked what he thought would be best (meaning 51/50 or talking it through with his therapist in the AM) and he told me he wanted the talk to his therapist. So the next day when he disappeared from work we (his family and I) their the worst. And 5 hours after he had shut off his phone we saw he had driven 80 miles away. When he turned his phone off he went to a store and bought a knife and thought about hurting himself. 

When we spoke when he came back and I asked him why he did it he told me that he was numb. He was also saying that he wished that he was normal and didn’t have to take so many medications just to feel nothing. I don’t know how to help him I support him when he needs it and I’m always going to be there when he needs me. He never asked for help I have to pry it out of him.

Now, I feel incredible shame and guilt for not having talked to anyone for months. Not even to my best friends. I just shut down all possible ways of contact and kept prolonging the period of opening myself up again to them. 

I really want to message my friends again, and see them again. But I have no clue how to approach this since they haven't heard from me in months. I know they're all pretty worried, and that it won't be how it was before.

840,How do I go back to living?,"So I am not sure what this post is. Question, venting, or simply silent scream for help, but I hope it is okay to post here. 

I will start with a little life story. I used to think my childhood was good. Slightly turbulent at times but I had an amazing mom with whom I had great relationship and we could talk about anythink. Well... over past few years I have realized this was just me not realizing how bad it was and thinking everybody had to deal with something similar. With the pink filter off I can say it was trauma packed on trauma with a cherry trauma on top. My father was an abusive asshole with anger issues and probably some narcissistic traits. He would be super nice on a normal day and especially when outsiders were present, but once he got angry dishes were flying and no language filter was applied. I remember once playing badminton with my sister, I sucked and it ticked me of and I threw the racket on the ground. It being made of wood broke. I hid it in garage and pretended like it never happened. When my father wanted to play with my sister and found out he stormed inside and threw it at me with full strength. It barely missed my head and smashed itself on the wall. I ran out and don't remember much after. I know my mom was in the room with me and they argued. Well my mom has married him because she got pregnant with my sister (half sister), not because she loved him. This life with him took huge toll on her, I haven't realized until I was at high school. She hated him, but couldn't leave him because he was making money and she only had highschool diploma and couldnt find a job and support two children on her own. She had high functioning depressesion, abused alcohol and sleeping pills and had three suicide attempts. On her sober day she was the best mom, but on weekends she would drink and drink and then in the evening she would take ambien and fall asleep on the counter trying to make midnight snack. Her first attempt was when I was 8. Father was at work and me and my sister were doing homework. She was drinking and at some point she walked out of kitchen and fell unconcious. We didn't know what to do so all I could do was use toilet paper to clean the blood of her arms (she broke a tea karafe) and wait till dad came home. I later found out from her that she took a lot of sleeping pills and tried to cut her wrists. This is only a tiny bit of the events I went through, which lead me to move to a different country. My mom drowned in our jacuzzi in 2020 after a day of drinking (we don't know if pills were taken) and I was the one to give her cpr. 6 months later my dad argued with my sister and changed locks after she decided to spend christmas at her friends. 

Moving to todays time, my sister lives alone and has a stable job. I don't talk to father. I lost my job when corona came and I haven't managed to land a new one till now. I have been seing a therapist in 2021 after the change of locks event and it helped a lot. I thought I was fine until fall last year. I am depressed and suicidal. I managed to get myself into outpatient psychiatric treatment, but its going very slow. I saw a psychiatrist once in december and got pills, but the haven't been working so I called in january to book an appointment with a psychiatrist, but it got moved from february to march to now mid may. I see a therapist there too, but we are still in the early getting to know the story stage since she can only see me once month for 45min. I can't afford payed therapist right now. 

I really struggle with identity and reason for living. It feels like I spent my life trying to get a good job abroad to help mom finacially, then to help my sister, but now that everything is fine I realized I have no idea about what I like and value. No interests from past seem any fun no, I have no clue what kind of job I would like, or even what are my values. All I know is that I feel the same way I imagine an 80 lady to feel on her death bed. Contempt with her life, no regrets and ready to move on.  I'm not sad I just don't have anything that would spark any will to live. I've been trying to not hurt myself because I don't want to hurt my boufriend and sister, but that just feels like I am being forced to suffer. 

My emotions are also weird. When I talk about my past I feel fine, even though I think I should cry. But then I see Tamy being aproved for surgery and feel the urge to cry from happiness. My days are just bleak and boring from waking up I just 'am' till I eat and sleep. I keep going back to toughts of wanting to die, how hard it is to die without pain and uncertainty and so on. I always reject it with an image of my bf finding me like that, but the thought are so overwhelming and tiring. I am just tired, numb and dead inside. 

Is there anyone who has been or is going through anything similar? I would really love if I could get my hands on anything that could help me overcome this state. Books, articles, whatever, even if it's just a diagnosis name. I am seeking a professional help to the extent I can afford. I will list few books I've read that didn't save me.

845,"Discovering True Happiness: Tips, Strategies, and Habits to Achieve Lasting Joy and Fulfillment.","We all want to be happy in life, but what is happiness really? Is it something that can be bought with money or achieved by having a certain lifestyle? Happiness isn’t one size fits all; instead, it’s an ever-evolving concept.

The idea of true joy goes beyond fleeting moments of pleasure – it requires us to look inwardly at ourselves and identify where we need improvement. By cultivating feelings such as self-love, gratitude, compassion, purposeful living, and mindfulness, we can begin to find balance within ourselves and lead happier lives.

It takes time and effort to achieve lasting happiness, but there are ways to get started on your journey today!

846,How do I do?,"When no one is depending on me I cant do anything Id like for myself. Oftentimes struggling with essentials like getting out of bed and feeding myself let alone things I no longer enjoy

(21M) Clinically diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety, OCD and ADHD 

Never met my dad properly (dead), suffered cruel, unusual, obsessive abuse from step-dad, stemming from his diagnosed OCPD and BPD, mom is cold, indifferent, young half siblings were conditioned to hate me. Developed a ""contamination varient"" of OCD along with my other diagnoses

Right now I live on my own, additionally tortured by descitions I made that hurt people I cared about, platonically, romantically ""real-life OCD varient"" im being told I suffer from right now, though I do still get some residual from past varient along with my other diagnoses. 

I have felt little to nothing following accomplishments, human connections and hobbies 

The days have been blending together for so long I feel as if I could have been waking up for elementary school, I have worn the same varients of clothes for nearly a decade

I have tried everything im ""suppose to"" as far as I know:

-diet
-exercise
-therapy/medication/treatment
-""atomic habits""
-hobbies
-gratitude
-affirmations

Havent had any success

Habits at even an atomic scale dont stick for me

Expect therapist to ""ask the right"" questions so as to guide me to my own conclusions and solutions, but the many Ive tried have only *shot the shit* with me 

Medication has yeilded neither good nor bad effects. Did see some improvement from stimulants but my body quickly adapted to them weeks later, leading me to question their use long term. Trying TMS, halfway through, nothing.

Intention was to ""steralize"" my writing as best I could, cutting out jokes, anecdotes and flowery language because I wanted to respect those who may only have so much time to help me :] tho please ask if elaboration is needed anywhere

I just want to be able to consistantly get up and do what I set out to and like it enough to seek out more as others do :] any suggestions? Thanks",1678058017.0
847,I know this will probably be seen by only a few people,"But I have been going through my old phones and they are like little time capsules into my past. 

Most of the people I see in Snapchat are blocked now or they blocked me and it’s so sad that people grow apart so violently and fast sometimes it hurts. 

I feel like I’m broken and half the person I once was. 

Pls I don’t want the comments “go to therapy” because I have been to 15+ different psychologists/social workers it just seems like a scam at this point. 

Just felt the sentiment and that I’m losing myself.",1678036343.0
848,I need help,"Hi Reddit, 
I’m turning here for help because at this point I’ve talked to friends and my therapist about it, and while there words are comforting in the moment, I can’t let this situation go. Four years, I had just returned back to my old high school after doing a year of boarding school. Truth be told I wasn’t in a good mindset; it had been hard living at home the previous year because of the frequent and intense arguments between me and my parents, and I was apprehensive about returning and living in that environment. I also was feeling very uncertain about my future at the time and doubting my ability as a student to finish high school, and I felt subpar to my peers academically. 
At my old high school the year started with this all school camping trip which lasted a few days, and it was no exception when I came back. Anyways there was a girl who started dropping clear hints that she liked me and I decided to go with it because she was smart and pretty, and flirting and being around her made me, and at that point I just wanted to be happy. 
Anyways, we hung out a few times after that walking downtown and talking. I quickly worked up the courage to ask her to a movie but we decided just to watch one at my house since the one we wanted to see in theaters was sold out.  
So she came after school one day, and we started watching this movie and it started out so good. We were cuddling together and then we had our first kiss, my first kiss and it was wonderful. We cuddled more and kissed again, and I kissed her forehead and cheeks and she did the same. It was going so perfectly. 
After a little bit more time watching the movie, I asked if she was hungry and she said she was so we went upstairs (we were in the basement) and melted some shredded cheese on nachos. After we had finished eating, we repositioned ourselves so she was lying on top of me, and we started making out more. At a certain point she slipped her tongue into her mouth, just once, and I took that as a sign to escalate things which was a huge mistake. No clothes came off and I never grabbed underneath her clothes, but I did grab her ass and I was French kissing her to aggressively. I should have asked if what I was doing was ok, if she was okay with it but I didn’t. After a couple seconds she pulled away, checked her phone, and said he had to leave soon but she did lay back on my chest and for the rest of the time we just watched the movie and cuddled. 
After that, I kept texting seeing if she was free but she never was, always saying she was busy. This was the first inclination I got that I fucked up, but I was so oblivious to what I did it didn’t register I fucked up at first. We didn’t share classes at school but she stopped talking to me in person, and my texts to hang were always met with an excuse not to meet up. 
For some reason, I asked her out after this, a true sign of how thick skulled I was. Mabye I thought it would make things better? Honestly couldn’t tell you my logic, I don’t know what I was thinking. Anyways that was right before the schools two week vacation for winter 2019. Over break I get a text saying she doesn’t want anything romantic or anything more which is when I knew for sure I had fucked up. 
Two weeks later she started dating one my best friends, which cut me deep. I have a vivid memory of them leaving campus together in his car, which I looked on. I never said anything to either them about it though. It was their relationship and they could both do what they wanted, but every-time I saw them together I could only think that it could have been me with her. 
Anyways a year passes and we finally talk about what happened after I contacted her and asked to talk. She said herself we could move past it but I just can’t. I probably just like the idea of us together and not her herself, the saddest part is I do barley know her, but I just over how it ended between us. I just wish we had a normal relationship, and broke up normally, it would have been so much easier to move on. But I can’t, and it’s been four years at this point and I feel pathetic about it all. I feel like I’ve wasted the last four years of my life, drinking and smoking to numb myself to the emotions I feel. I miss her so much, I just want to talk to her again and be friends but I know this isn’t a realistic goal. I wish I could just move on with my life, because I feel like she did  move on, the day I fucked up our whole relationship",1678041709.0
849,it's bad tonight,I know my life is.practically done. I don't know what to do about it. I'm so depressed. I'm trying to make myself cry so I feel something. I'm numb. My stomach hurts. My shoulders are tight. My muscles are knotted. I am dying.,1677996844.0
850,venting about numbness,Day in and day out there's little I can feel. But what sucks the most is often I CAN feel the negative emotions. People can piss me off. That's just about it. Can't even really get sad. I feel like I am lying to people as I pretend to have emotions everyday. I am getting my Masters in teaching and about to graduate but I don't even have any interest in getting a job coz I just can't feel any interest. And dont even get me started on the teaching part. It is one of the hardest professions to begin with and even harder when you cant feel motivated. I just feel like My life sucks. I just hate being the person that I am and I want the old me back.,1678028219.0

852,deciding to go the school counsellor for support. I don't want my parents to know anything about it. should I be careful about what I say? would really REALLY appreciate advice. [NSFW,"tw. Self harm, suicide(al thoughts)

I have posted this in another subreddit but got no response. I'm really separate because I have sent my schoo counsellor a message already. I don't think she has seen it yet so I have time to delete it, but I don't know if I should, but If I should, I should do it really soon.

In summary, I am a socially anxious student who thinks everyone hates me (this can go on and off at times, dependent on whoever) and I self harm from time to time because I hate myself a lot. I am not diagnosed with anything because I have never told anyone about how I feel. I am scared they will think I am an attention seeker, they won't care, they will hate me, they will give up on me, or think I deserve it.

I have decided to go to my school counsellor because I feel like I feel a need to explain why I act the way I act ; sometimes I feel like people think I don't put any effort in trying socialize or come to class on time, or not do my school work on time, when really I am anxious and scared of people, so I have to take breaks in between, or I sort of 'shut down'. Probably not the right reason, but i do feel this will take some weight of me and help me feel less stressed around people, knowing that people know that I AM trying my best (mostly speaking about teachers here. And my anxiety is definitely affecting my education. I also feel a need to make my teachers like me because my parents don't.

I feel like I sound so selfish and narcissistic for saying that...

Anyhow, I know that I cannot talk to her about my suicidal thoughts (to be clear, I have never tried to kill myself and I know I can't because of my parents, I just LOVE thinking about it, though I plan on killing myself in the future when both my parents aren't alive anymore, and if I'm unsuccessful in life) and that I self harm, because she will have to tell my parents by law.

Are there any other topics I should avoid talking about?
I really don't want her telling my parents. This genuinely GENUINLY will make my self harm issue worse, and no one will know about it.
Should I just avoid speaking to her altogether??

Should I mention to her that I hate myself or should I leave it  out? Would she tell my parents?
I plan on just telling her I think other people don't like me very much / hate me / hate even just my presence
 This will be the focus of the conversation.
I'm worried she will assume it is because I hate myself
Will she assume that?


Before you say that telling my parents is a good idea, it is not. HONESTLY. Nothing you say will convince me so please don't waste your energy typing anything to do with it down, or asking questions why. This is the first time I am asking for help, I need this to go correct.

I am planning to make a script before I talk to her because I find it hard to describe how I am feeling and I don't want to slip up anything I shouldn't.

I would really appreciate advice on what to say. Thank you <3",1678008542.0
853,I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want to do anything.,"I know I need help, I'm at the lowest I've ever been. I have no interest in anything, takes me 1-2 days of convincing myself to just clean my house. Only leave my house to go to work, no close friends just talk to my kids.

The problem is I don't know if I want help. Been up and down with depression so many times. The last time I was happy ended abruptly and forced me to realize the harsh truth that life will not work out for me. I will not be able to handle another fight of clawing to be happy only to fall back down.

854,Is there a type of therapy like pen pals?,"I have severe depressive disorder. After this summer and finally going to the mental hospital, I got the treatment I needed. I have been seeing a therapist since September and I have been on medication (Cymbalta) since then as well.

I feel a lot healthier and happier but I hate talk therapy. I want to be able to express how I feel and talk through mechanisms, but I feel like when I talk in person, I hold back and feel so uncomfortable. I feel like I’ve always been told to smile and be polite and I can never really open up. 

I started thinking maybe there’s a therapy that is completely written, and I know the first thing people will think is a diary. But I want the commitment/obligation to keep doing it because I respect the other person, but without the physical presence…if that makes sense?

Does anyone know of a therapy program like that?",1677992301.0

856,I am always being told that depression is a choice.,"I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety 10 years ago. Now my new doctor thinks that it might be ADHD. So no confirmed diagnosis yet but suffering continues. 
The purpose of this post is to find some support. Currently I live in a different country than my family and had to make new friends. However, I was once again proven to not be able to judge people correctly. So I made friends, they were just there for their own benefits, as soon as they found new people they left me alone. So I am going through a major depressive episode right now, but I have no one to talk to. I often think about unaliving myself. I went to see the doctor but that isn't helping either. My supervisor at the school is also not much concerned about my mental health, he cares more about his reputation. My new housemate is a covert narcissist. She has pushed me on the sidelines in my own social circle, and people whom I thought to be my friends now trust her word more than me. So I have academic stress, bad living environment, financial stress, betrayed by friends, homesickness and loneliness. By each day passing I am getting more and more tired. I am losing hope even though I pray regularly, I don't see any light. I feel like I should just give up.",1678014127.0
857,I feel disconnected from everything - seeking help on how to start treatment,"My depression is starting to become more unmanageable alone.

I feel that everyone is just trying to fulfill their ego’s needs, go through the motions, or to better their situation financially.  I keep working just to pay bills and survive, but I’m just missing the point of it all.  I feel disconnected from everyone and everything.  I don’t have anything to look forward to and my marriage is starting to fall apart.  My wife is going to give up on me if I don’t somehow treat my depression, but I have no clue on how to start.

858,Christianity vent help please,"TW?: My dad is an overly obsessive Christian crazo. My mom is also super Christian but not on the same level.

 I have very bad and traumatic experiences with Christianity. They know this. It makes me unbearably uncomfortable. They also know this. Going to church triggers the hell out of me and makes my mental health bad. They know this, too. 

Do they care? No. They force me to go with them, knowing what it does to me. They are upset that I am not Christian. My mom's words ""they would love more than anything for me to be Christian."" My dad, on a regular basis, tries to stir up shit because he is Christian, and I am a satanist.

 I feel like they don't give a shit about me. Their stupid religion is more important to them than their own child. They don't care about me. As long as this sky man is pleased, that's all that seems to matter to them. I really, really, really can't go to church tomorrow. 

Also, I should mention that I have autism that is between severe and moderate. So on top of all of that I have to deal with the noise and the lights. I hate it. It litterally vibrates your chest from the volume. It makes me go nonverbal and have a meltdown every time. I told her that if she wants me to go she'll have to drag me out of the house but she told me that she wouldn't but if I refused and shit than she would take stuff away from me

Please help. I hate Christianity. I really wish it never existed :/",1677987948.0
859,I’m scared to try anti-depressants because I don’t want to feel less than I do now,"I’m not totally numb, but my emotions are very dulled. I used to be a very sensitive person, I found things beautiful and happy easily and also found things sad easily but I was ok with that, now the only thing I feel to any major extent is anxious, tired, and apathetic (if you can even call that a feeling). It hurts to try to do things I once enjoyed and to not feel anything - being creative makes me stressed and self hating, I get bored reading, music is just a distraction from my thoughts. I hate it. My therapist suggested anti-depressants and I thought maybe about giving it a go (though I’m not sure how I’d explain to my parents) but I’m scared they’ll make me feel less, even if less depressed. I don’t get it. That sounds so much worse, why is that considered a solution? I just want to be able to feel my emotions fully again and not have all these shit disturbing thoughts",1677980463.0
860,Is anyone afraid of reaching out for help?,"I think people might be well intending but are a little too eager to pat themselves on the back at times. When people struggle with depression or have thoughts of harm, they can get tossed on a psych hold or people can take away things from them to stop them from harming themselves. That doesn't actually help them though. Without an actual plan or intent to help them, all it is doing is making it so they won't reach out next time.  


I have been given a boost in sedation medication and put on a 72-hour hold, but all that did was make me sleep most of the time. The depression was still there. Then dealing with everyone taking shoelaces, magazines with staples, plastic knives, forks, etc, what kind of life is that? In an effort to ""Save"" people...we are almost condemning them to a fate where they wish they had followed through. Then when other's feel proud of stopping you and go about their way leaving you back at square one.  


Then it just fosters a fear of reaching out, and repeating this fate",1677974605.0
