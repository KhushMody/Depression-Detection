0,a little motivation from someone who thought things would never change,"hi there! if you’re reading this and you’re stuck in a hole and feel like you’re never getting out, let me just say i was in that place for years. it sucks. i’m not going to sugar coat it and tell you everything is going to get better IMMEDIATELY, but i will tell you that it does. i went through three years of hell. bullying, depression, assault, sexual harassment, and took an attempt at my own life. i felt so alone and thought i’d never be happy, until i switched schools and dropped everyone i knew. it sounds drastic, but hear me out. the people you surround yourself with can change your whole view. the people i were around before didn’t care, i was simply an object at their disposal. if you’re with people who treat you like that, they aren’t friends, they’re oppressors. it wasn’t instant, i was alone for a long time, but when you finally find a new friend, they’ll lead you to more friends. you have to have faith in your support system. if you don’t trust the people who should be there for you, it’s time for new people. it does get better. you just have to work for it. i’m back up to straight As it’s been 6 months since i self harmed last and i now have people i can rely on. my quality of life has improved greatly. if you can surround yourself with better people you can make a lot more progress. i’m still depressed and pretty traumatized, but i feel so much safer and it’s easier to cope now. keep working, i love you, and i hope you find peace.",1610310379.0

4,"Texan, Homeschooled and Christian; but it does bet better.","Hello Reddit. I'd like to share a bit about my life that may help some people on here. Sorry if this drags on. I couldn't think of a way to summarize any more. 

My parents homeschooled my brothers and I. Some might even say we were ""Bible Schooled"". We attended church six times a week, plus bible study. 
From the age of 11 until I was 18, we had constant sermons about the sins of homosexuality. If it wasn't the topic of the sermon, it was at least mentioned once a week. It seemed as though the pastor had to remind us to hate homosexuals. 
The day I realized that they were preaching about me; my world sunk. It baffles my mind now; to think at how slow I was to realize that I was part of the object of hate. It was part of who I am.  How the feelings I had were labeled with these terms of hate. Even the crush I had was now an abomination. It was almost as if overnight I became a communist during the cold war. 
When I was 18, I was diagnosed with cancer and couldn't handle it anymore. I figured, if I was going to die someone needed to know how I felt. So I told my younger brother. As the youngest in the family I thought he was going to be the most accepting. A few months later, he was with me when I told my older brother, who also accepted me. I was on top of the world, until we told our mother. 
She cried; she cried about how cancer wasn't enough. How I had to rip the family apart with my lifestyle, and she told our father. When my father came home after being told, he interrogated me for several hours. Every question was rhetorical. I could feel the hatred in his word, and I could see the sorrow in his eyes. ""If I had a son to disown I would. But you are already dead to me."" The worst moment of my life was hearing that sentence. 
I was told that I had four weeks to move out, and that was only granted because of my cancer. It was the most difficult few weeks of my life. I was up for my scans to see if I was going into remission... But I was dead to my father, and would rather be dead in real life. It was the day before I had to move out when my father approached and he told me that I wasn't dead to him, and that he loved me. 
My father let me know that more than anything else he was scared for my well being, as he sees the hatred and bigotry first hand. He told me that he is homophobic; but he loves me more than he hated gays. He asked me to give him time to adjust, but he will always be in my life. 

I'm now 25 years old now. I am going back to school next year for my Masters Degree. It has been a tough road, but my family loves me. I love them, more so than I ever could in the closet.

The reason I'm telling you all this is because I wish I had someone to tell me these things when I was younger. That the world is scary, bitter, and damaging; but you will make it through. There is the other side of the rainbow, and its populated by people who care. Don't let the hate of others drag you down. Just be yourself for who you are. 

The most important thing that I can say is that I love you. I have never met you, and I love you. Never forget that.",1379543242.0
5,YOUR POST COULD HELP SAVE NYC PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES,"Hey everyone, I hope that you’re all well during these extremely difficult times

&#x200B;

So I’ll cut to the chase. I am a nurse in New York City, and a doctoral candidate in nursing practice, specifically in psychiatry. New York State hospitals are rapidly shutting down psych units and claiming it’s because of covid, even though my hospital hasn’t seen a symptomatic covid patient in about a month. In fact, the covid units are empty. I am currently working with a prominent nurse’s union, some of my professors and other nurses and doctoral candidates to do something about this. I can’t sleep at night knowing my patients are suffering both horrible injustices and serious mental illnesses. 

&#x200B;

I have a meeting with a NYS senator this week, and I know that this is short notice, but if anyone has a story about how they or a family member needed/needs acute psychiatric care/hospitalization, and cannot get it because psych patients are being pushed out of ER’s etc. The cause could use your help. Feel free to DM me. If you have a story, something you would like to tell a public official in order to help us to reopen these desperately needed psych units, please come forward and message me.

&#x200B;

Personally, I know of so many overdoses, suicides, and crises that are happening right now. People can’t get the help they need and deserve. I’m doing my best to fight for these people. Mental health matters. If you have a story, first-hand accounts are incredibly powerful. I would be more grateful than I can express for your courage and willingness to stand up and say that you, or a friend, or family member is suffering and cannot receive help.

&#x200B;

It is preferable if you live in The Bronx or Manhattan, as these are the locations that are under this elected official’s jurisdiction and are the populations that this particular hospital system serves.

6,"Things have gotten better since high school, but I've still never had a boyfriend. I'm 19 and came out when I was 14. It's depressing.","I've watched almost all of my friends go through relationships, flings, etc. I have yet to date anyone and I had my first kiss this summer with a friend of a friend at a party where we were both drunk and almost had sex and I regret it a lot because I never saw him after that (But I do not regret that we didn't have sex, I'm glad I wasn't that drunk!). It's been really frustrating, always being the friend, never the boyfriend. I've had gay friends better never one that I wanted to date. I ended up transferring schools just to increase the population of gay guys that I'm around (I'll be at my new school in January). It's difficult to explain to my friends how important this is to me, because it seems like such a silly thing: ""I really want a bf! FML! Why don't guys like me! blahblahblah!"" I feel like an annoying teenage girl if I try to talk about it with anyone...

But how can I feel attractive or lovable if I never have someone love me? How can I know if I'm a good partner if I'm never in a partnership? It's utterly depressing. If I ever see myself in the mirror and think ""wow I'm looking good today!"", my thoughts immediately turn to the fact that I've never had a bf and therefore I must not actually be attractive, it's just my mind playing a trick on me. Someone help me get out of this funk, I don't know what to do. :(

Btw, I have an okcupid account, I've been on a few dates, I've flirted. But I'm really picky with my guys/it never works out. Should I lower my standards? (I really don't want to...)

8,"Ups and downs, there are always ups and downs","2 years ago, I tried to kill myself. There was blood everywhere and at the time it seemed like the greatest idea in the world. 

Now, I sit here in my apartment, I just used a cheat to pay for a disabled woman’s parking when she asked me to help her since she could not reach the ticket machine. I chuckled at her amazement (thinking that I paid for it) and just said “it’s my pleasure” as I walked away. 

2 years ago I did not see a way out, today I study Emergency Medicine. I save lives during my clinical practice shifts, actual lives. 


I’m happy, I’m going to go buy a plant now and go for a run later. Maybe hit the gym. It’s sunny outside, people are laughing. Instagram is full of videos about the new presidential inauguration and the cool flypasts that the airforce did. It’s a good day. Oh and I slept for like 12 hours last night, since I ran the last 2 weeks on not much more than 5 hours of sleep. I feel amazing. 


There are dips, sad times. I just tell myself that I will not let anyone or anything stop me now, not when I got this far. I’m spiteful like that. 


I forced my way through school, forced myself to study just thinking about the end goal that I wanted to reach. That’s how I got into uni, that’s how I am in the top 1% of candidates that applied for my degree.

9,24 y/o still in a lot of pain,"I don't want to make this too long, but I figure I should give you some information about myself. I'm 24, which is probably older than the average poster on here, and I know so many people have had it so much worse than me, and my heart truly breaks for them. But here goes... I'm the youngest of 5 boys and I've always been extremely close to my extremely conservative and catholic parents. I've known I was gay since I was 11 or 12, suppressed it deep inside to the point that all throughout high school even I didn't believe I was gay. Finally when I was 19 or 20 I developed a crush on a coworker who I learned was gay, so I finally decided to embrace my homosexuality. I joined a gay dating site, met a guy, and he convinced me to start dating. I was not ready and I was not happy in that relationship that lasted for two years. I was too afraid to hurt him to make myself happy. Finally, I moved away to school and ended our relationship at the end of that school year. That summer, I got into a debate with my mom about gay marriage and she ended up asking if I'm gay. Shocked, I denied it. However, she treated me like a stranger for several days which really hurt me. A couple years later, I came home for Christmas break and on New Years Day, my dad coaxed it out of me that I'm gay. It was a terrifying moment, but both my parents assured me they still loved me. However, not long after that they brought up conversion therapy and started pushing it on me. Hard. I refused as much as I could but it was an exhausting, painful process. I ended up talking to a priest and a conversion therapist over the phone at their request. The priest was somewhat sympathetic, but the therapist was laughable in his views. I told my parents I refused to talk to him anymore which outraged them. The next two weeks were the most painful of my life. I wanted to go back to school, but I was afraid they would cut me off financially. I was just scared. Finally, the time came when I had to go back to school. The next couple months were rough, balancing my final year of college with a lot of unpleasant confrontations with my parents via text and phone calls. They said a lot of very very hurtful things. However, by the end of the semester, things had improved. My parents came down for my graduation and things were somewhat pleasant. That summer, I moved back home and things were fine at first, but I guess I still had a lot of anger in me and I guess it showed. One day while mowing the lawn, my mom read my text messages with a gay guy I am very good friends with. She should never had read those texts because they were both sexual and insulting to my parents. Both my parents confronted me about the texts and told me that I ""couldn't leave"" the house. I bolted on foot, and my friend picked me up and took me to my brother's. I lived with two of my brothers for about the next week, and my parents drained my bank account so I had to rely on my brothers for everything. Eventually, my oldest brother convinced my parents to calm down and talk to me. I went home and attempted to smooth things over. I realized that I needed to play nice until I got to grad school. I've been away at grad school now for a couple months, and it's like everything that has happened is now soaking in, everything my parents have done to me, said to me. I can't imagine a future that involves me, my parents, and, my homosexuality, and that makes me incredibly depressed. There's a constant pain in my stomach. Every time I get a text from my parents I get a panic attack because of all the times they texted hurtful things to me. I'm attending counseling sessions on campus, but they don't seem to be helping much. I guess I just needed to rant. Thanks to whoever reads this for listening.

10,"Just a reminder for anyone who may have a young relative questioning their gender, that coming out early, and having supportive people really is important, and to please help them.","Hey. I'm an eighteen year old agender person. I came out of the closet at thirteen years of age, and I'm really happy that I did. 

Because I live in Manhattan, most of my peers have been accepting. And because my family is accepting they were accepting. I cannot stress how much this has helped. 

Having been out so long has allowed me to become confident. It's allowed me to accept myself and understand my identity. It's allowed me to learn how to dress and act in a way that feels comfortable. And most importantly, it's made me feel like I'm not broken. 

Its also saved me from a lot of experiences that would have caused a lot of pain, there's a lot of things that would have been very dysphoric if I had to go through them while living as a female. It's really helped that I haven't had to go through high school as a girl, I know thatvthat would have been the most painful time in my life. Luckily it turned out to be one of the best. And thanks to help I was able to learn how to deal with things happening to my body that I really needed support for. 

I've also been able to go through therapy that's allow me to work twords medical transition. I was able to get a hysterectomy recently. And I'll probably be able to have nullification (genital removal) before I turn 20.

I know that not everyone could have had my life. Don't feel bad it f you've had it harder then me e. Someday things will be better. This post was not intended to make anyone feel bad about thier own life. 

What this post is realig for, is if you have a gender questioning child, or a young gender questioning friend or family member, please be support.

""The reason so many people think their lives are meaningless is because they are. People assign their own meaning to their lives.""

13,Free and easy to use mental health resources I’ve found useful,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

17,"Dear Whomever May Be Going Through Difficult Changes,","You may be stuck in a difficult situation, not knowing how to adjust but it gets better, it really does. 

My life drastically changed when I moved from the house I grew up in. Although I was glad to not be moving schools it was still sad moving houses, all of my memories were there… 

The sleepovers, staying up all night in the summer, jumping on the trampoline, watching the best childhood shows. Although that may sound silly, I cherish all the memories there I can definitely say those were the best days of my life. 

The new house never felt the same… it wasn’t home. Especially when my mom moved a guy in. One day I came home from school and there was a random person in my house. I didn’t know what to think or where he came from. 

My mom said he was moving in but there was always something off about him. He was rude to everyone, even my dogs. Everything was different when he moved in. Now I felt even more out of place--

My mom started to act different too, spending less time with me and my brother and becoming irresponsible with bills. The Wifi got shut off, so I was always bored and they were always locked away in their bedroom. 

One time, we didn’t even have heat. I remember how cold it was, but why was all this happening. I would think “what I did to deserve having him come into our lives?”.

Then I started seeing needles in random places I would get so confused, thinking why are there needles in my house? Later I come to find out he got my mom addicted to heroin. The needles I was seeing were used to shoot up heroin… 

That’s why they were always locked away in their bedroom and why she neglected me and my brother. He brainwashed my mom. She couldn’t see that he was evil.

It was so bad one time my mom was supposed to take me out to eat for my birthday and instead she ended up guilting me into giving her my birthday money… which she used for drugs. 

It’s okay to let out emotions when going through difficult changes. 

I couldn’t stand him or living there anymore so I decided to do what was best and leave. I told my grandma everything that was going on and of course she let me move in with her. We knew we had to get rid of him. Even in difficult situations you should think it over and decide what’s best for you. 

Not long after my mom ended up getting all her kids taken away including the baby my mom and him had. We got put into foster care but thankfully we were able to stay with my grandma and he ended up going to jail. My mom went to programs and got better and we’re all way happier now. 

I had to adapt to all of these changes and honestly I’ve tried to block out a lot of the trauma he put us through but it still has really affected me but I have overcome it and got out of the situation.

I am much happier now after getting out of the situation I was put into. I graduated high school and am now going to college. I feel successful and proud of myself because despite it all I still focused and worked hard. I believe in you too, you are strong enough to get through any situation you set your mind to. My mom has her own house and car again after losing everything and I’m able to see her and still live safely with my grandma, so things do get better and you can overcome anything and just know things take time but it will all be okay in the end.

20,"I never thought I'd need to be told ""it gets better."" ","When I came out to my friends and family, I was met with unconditional love. Yes, there were a lot of tears, but they were my own tears. I felt like I was quashing their hopes and dreams for me, yet they did nothing but reaffirm their love for me. 

Looking back, I never noticed that the support was limited. I brushed aside the subtle statements, like ""maybe you just haven't met the right girl."" The only family member (maternal family...) that actively acknowledges my homosexuality is my uncle. Fortunately, for him, it's no big deal. He'll joke with me about it and has never treated me differently. The rest of the family consistently tells me they love me, but refuses to acknowledge my sexuality. When I voiced my stance on gay rights, they made it clear that they were not in agreement. They've harped on about Freedom of Speech and has claimed that I am intolerant of their beliefs. I've done all I can to make clear that I'm not speaking only of same-sex marriages (or unions, or whatever the fuck they want to call it); I'm speaking of my ~~desire~~ right to raise children. I've been told that my ""beliefs"" are an attack on their beliefs; an attack ""on their orientation."" The biggest blow is that I've always loved my family. When I left for college, they were the ones that I missed terribly. They were the ones that I always wanted to be near. Yet now I find myself so close to severing those ties. I've had friends tell me not to sever ties, that family is one of the most important things in life. I can't bear to hold onto a family that can only truly love half of me. 

The bright side is that my paternal family is supportive. My sister has never stopped defending me, and I know that my dad loves me unconditionally. I guess it's a perk of being the only son. Of course, that is also because his brother is gay, and he had to come to terms with that long before I was born. 

To clarify, I do not regret coming out and embracing my sexuality. I just did not expect it to change everything. I've made some amazing friendships and have found that I can be closer to my friends than I thought possible. I just wish I didn't have to risk losing my family by embracing who I am and finding happiness. ",1343951701.0

Okay, so there was a point in my life where I managed to hit rock bottom. I was really unhappy with my job and I had no idea where my life was going. I entered this vicious cycle wherein I would think about my problems, get sad, eat to make myself feel better, being momentarily happy then think about my problems again, and repeat. 

There were times were I considered just giving up because I thought that things were never going to get better. What saved me was my girlfriend and to this day I'm still thankful for her. So what it is that she did? The answer is that she was there for me. Even at my worst, she still did her best to support me and she tried to hide her own sadness while doing so. 

What made me open my eyes was what happened during a particular day. I can't go into any details cause it's too personal, so I'll share the short version: I was supposed to do something for her, I couldn't do it, and I felt horrible afterwards. Even when I couldn't do what I needed to for her, she comforted me and told me that it was alright. She was badly trying to hide how sad she was, and it was the pain in her face that made me realize that things couldn't go on like that anymore.

So I worked hard. She became my motivation so that I could get out of rock bottom. And with all the effort and hard work I put into getting back to the man that I once was, I can say that it all paid off. I still hate myself for taking so long to see how sad she was, but I'm glad that I can stand side-by-side with her without shame and that I can see her true happy face again. 

I made something that may help those who are having trouble finding the motivation they need to do what they have to/need to. I really do hope it helps someone (You don't have to click it if you don't want to. I just hope that the story alone is enough to help people find the motivation they need.)

27,I am a 21yo gay male who has no sexual appetite.,"I thought about coming here before, and today is a bad day for me so here it goes.

Since I can remember I have never been a very sexual person, but I had my wild moments when I had desired men, sex, all that. I had a boyfriend for two years, and our sex life kindof sucked, because I was never really into it, i felt almost obligated to do it. After this relationship I tried with other men, but I couldn't even get an erection (happens too many times believe me) because I do not feel excited, horny, or whatever. I feel like I am locked in my mind, not being able to release my ""sexual instincts"". To me it seems I am too much racional and do not allow myself to feel my sexuality, because I am not totally sure of who I am, and I do not understand what it means to me to be gay. I came out to my mom 3 years ago and to this day she still hates it, asking if there is no chance that I change. 

Last night I tried to have sex with a guy but I simply could not do it, i could only come (with a lot of difficulty and persistance) through masturbation. All this is also related to my extreme fear of STD's, which I know is irrational and totally kills my instincts. 

I feel like shit, I feel so different. Everyone around me is young, horny and ready for action, and I just feel empty. I'm 21 and I have problems getting an erection! It's awful, and it kills me to see the looks of the guys after it happens. I feel ashamed, I feel inferior, I feel like something that belongs nowhere :( 

Sorry for the long text, but I had to write it down, it's a burden that kills me slowly inside, and keeps drying up all the ""life"" and happiness I can find inside me.

31,"For those of you who are having trouble finding happiness, don't give up.","Life can be very tough, there's no doubt about that. Those who've lead really tough lives may think that they don't deserve happiness or that they might never be happy again. I want to say that that isn't true.

This'll get a bit long so please bear with me.

I've been in rock bottom before. There was a point where I hated my job, my living situation, and even my looks (I kept eating cause I thought that would take the sadness away). I even considered just....ending it all because of how sad I was.

But then, my girlfriend managed to save me be helping me realize that there was a goal I had to achieve if I wanted to be happy again.

What was that goal? Well, to return to being the man that she first fell in love with.

It was really tough getting back, especially since I cried a lot and just wanted to give up on many occasions. But I pushed myself to keep going because I really wanted to see my girlfriend smile genuinely again. After a lot of time, effort, and both love and support from my girlfriend, I managed to achieve my goal. It was certainly difficult but it was well worth it because me and her have never been happier.

I know that not everyone has a person who's willing to give them the support they need, and that each person's situation in life differs (some having it much tougher than others). BUT, I also think that everyone deserves to be happy and that if a person is willing to work towards happiness, then he/she is sure to attain it. Happiness is always going to be waiting for you, and I know you'll be able to acquire it.

32,The Rose Story,"I tell this story a lot because it helps me talk about things and some people find it inspiring. I was talking to one of my friends who isn't doing well and I told him it, and it helped him. So I hope someone can find some use out of this. 

This happened in the wake of a lot of things. When I was 8 years old, my father passed, which kind of sent things downhill for me. About three years later, I would go to a school that would be fucking hell for me. I would be a victim of several things that I still can't entirely talk about, and it left me with severe PTSD that I still struggle with nearly a decade later. Things really got to a low point when I was 16 and being groomed by a much older man for profit, where the police had to get involved. By that point, I had attempted suicide several times, had a serious self-harming problem, and was considered psychotic at times due severe sleep deprivation and stress. 

In December of 2019, I was doing so poorly that I dropped out of school and was in the hospital twice in a month. I had been in therapy for two years and I was still struggling. As a last effort to help me, my family and I checked me out of the hospital and went to a residential rehab facility in the Tennessee mountains, over 500 miles away from home. I got signed in, brought my clothes, guitar and bass, MP3 player, headphones, and notebook to my room and I was stuck there. I was hundreds of miles away from home and it felt absolutely terrifying. I didn't even have a phone, so I had to use a phone at the front desk and send letters.

\-

As much as I hated staying there at first, I was likeable, so I quickly made friends and I settled in. I had my good days and my bad days. On good days, I'd go to the groups, talk with friends, and maybe even go to lunch or dinner with everybody! On really bad days, I wouldn't eat or sleep. My room was next to the music room, so on those bad days, I would play drums for hours until my hands bled and I literally could not move my arms anymore. I'd go throw things off the side of the mountain or refuse to leave my room. 

Regardless, I would almost always wear a bandanna. I have severe gender dysphoria and body issues, to the point that I wouldn't look at myself in the mirror sometimes. When it got bad and I couldn't stand the idea of people seeing my face, I would wear a yellow Twenty One Pilots bandanna over my face, only exposing my eyes. Sometimes, I wouldn't wear it over my face, but I would always have it around my neck.

\-

One day, I was having one of my bad days. My best friend there managed to drag me out of my room and to a group with her, somehow. She probably bribed me with letting me use her laptop to download music. 

We get to the group room and there's a guest speaker for that group today. It was a middle-aged woman, though I've forgotten what she looks like. I sat down with my friend and played on a Gameboy Colour that my family had sent me. As everyone settled down, the lady started writing on a whiteboard. As she was writing, she stopped and turned around to look at us. For a couple of moments, she kind of just looked us all over. After being silent for about a minute, she started talking.

""You know, we're all a rose. Whether your blooming, budding, wilting, or even just a tiny seed, you're still a rose. No matter how little or how much you've grown and no matter how hard the winter was, you're still a rose.""

The group was probably about CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or something, but I'd forgotten. I was just thinking about what she said the entire time. I actually lowered my bandanna for that group.

I had just recently come out as transgender and hadn't decided on a middle name yet. That day, I decided my middle name would be Rose.

\-

It's been a year since then. A year ago today, I was still in Tennessee. Now, I'm doing better than I ever have been. I'm in college, the frontwoman of a punk band, living in a city I love with a girl I love even more, and have become a bit of an activist as an extension of my music. I'm completely out as a transgender woman, have been on hormones for nearly five months now, and working towards the life that I want to live.

I honestly didn't expect to live past 18, but here I am now at 19 years old.

33,My mom is transphobic and it weighs on me a lot,"Please note: I am seeing a therapist and I am telling her about this, I hope she can help, but right now I just really need even a little support.

For context, I am a 17-year-old trans man, currently in my senior year of high school. I've been out at school since August and at home since about a week ago. Being out at home, it seems, was the worst choice of my life.

So I came out to my mom in October, after being closeted for 6 years. Her response? ""Oh it's okay! I went through the same phase when I was younger! Lol!"" and I don't think I have to say that that crushed my self esteem for months. A week ago, I got the courage to try again, and she was nice enough about it, but then the problems started rolling in.

The night after I came out she told me ""I'll never get used to calling you your new name! It's like if you had to call me Dad out of nowhere haha :) Why can't you just be [deadname] forever?"". On the way to therapy, she told me that it's so hard for HER that I'm trans, and that I confuse her so much, and that I need to be more understanding.

And now, she's trying to talk me out of going on HRT because, in her own words, I'll get ugly, and I already pass well enough, so why even bother? ""Your brother was such a cute kid before going through puberty, remember? Do you want to look like him? Do you want to have a long face? What if you get ugly?""

Then she outed me to my sister without asking or even telling me first. I found out from said sister over text.

And I just don't know what to do anymore. Like I said, she at least acted like she was fine with me the second time I came out, and will tell anyone who will listen how ""happy"" I am, but I feel more disheartened and uncomfortable now than ever. 

This is really just a new head of an existing hydra for her: for as long as I can remember, she's humiliated me in public and made me feel belittled for having different opinions to her, etc.

I can't stand the thought of living here for even a few more months. Being around her makes me feel like I should hate myself. I feel like I'm completely unlovable because of who I am. I feel like I'll never make it, or I'll never be who I really want because of my family (dad is abusive and every -phobic under the sun but we rely on him for insurance).

34,It really does. 6 months after coming out.,"Six months ago, I was in a bad place. I'd hid my sexuality from the people I loved and cared about for years... I was in a place of sadness, and felt boxed in. I was pushed to the edge.

I came out. 

At first, it was a really tough situation. My mom was confused, my brother rejected me, and the bullies I'd faced multiplied. Fast forward six months. I'm living a lovely life. My mom has accepted it (though I suspect she still doesn't quite get it), my brother has started talking to me, the bullies are gone. I'm living an out and proud life. I'm living in a new city, filled with people like me. I have friends who support me and help me. I have a girlfriend who is... is just fantastic. I'm a 19 year old young man. I'm bisexual.

36,I never thought I’d be the person I am today. (Long post),"Hey all! First time poster here and I just wanted to share my story. This is not a brag or any kind of “pity me” story, it’s just a little something to hopefully inspire some people to think towards the future. :)
I had a rough childhood, I’m not gonna sugarcoat any of it. I was physically, and mentally abused for a long time. My mom was/is a drug addict and my father was addicted to gambling. At 11 I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and by 14 I had been diagnosed with PTSD. I felt lost for so long, I let my memories and traumas consume me. When my dad decided to kick his gambling habit and split up with my mom, things went good for a little while but by then I had already been messing with the wrong kinds of people. 
I began doing drugs to try and self medicate (which is the worst idea I’ve ever had) and I surrounded myself with people who had the same kinds of problems I did. I attempted suicide when I was 16, but obviously failed. 
After that, I decided to get a therapist. She became a good friend to me, and helped me realize that my friendships were toxic and that I was headed down a terrible path. So I took her advice, tried a few different medications and found the one that worked, and I made some new friends at school (through a TON of trial and error.) I met a guy, who is now my boyfriend of almost a year, and finally discovered what a healthy relationship looks like. I’m not gonna say that I don’t have my bad days, because everyone does, but life is just so much better than it was a few years ago. 
Looking back, I never thought I would have what I have now. We’re planning to move into our first apartment soon, and we have both been contacted by our dream lines of work. I was accepted for college in April and I’m super excited for the future. I never thought I’d be planning out a life that is anything but short. 

Things may seem super hopeless but I promise you it’s not. I believe that almost anyone can get a second chance at a good life by making the right choices. Have a great day and try to stay positive, even though I know it’s difficult! :)",1589561216.0

39,If you're lonely... It gets better!,"Hello all I'm new to Reddit, but just wanted to put something out there that runs through my mind every day. I'm also not very good at expressing myself in words, but hopefully better with my actions.

For years, I was lonely in that I wanted to share my life with someone, I had lots of friends, dated around a lot, but there was always something missing.  

I would often try to mold myself into what I thought a partner would want, but I was never truly happy.  

Honestly it wasn't until I got sick of dating that I just developed almost a fuck it mentality, I woke up one morning, and realized I liked who was looking back at me flaws and all, so why the hell would I want to change myself to convince someone else to like me.  

Shorty after that I met the greatest girl, we have been together for three years now, and I honestly can't tell you enough how lucky I am that we found each other.  I feel like I can never express it enough, she is the lamb to my tuna fish...I love her so much and feel like there is never enough that I can do to show her.  

But before I go on too much of a tangent, I guess I just wanted to say there is a lot of Truth in the old adage that you will find love when you stop trying to.

So stop trying to change yourself into what you think someone would want you to be, and just be the person you want to be.  Just know that you're perfect the way you are, you've gone through hard times and good times, and you're still here... So keep fighting the good fight you beautiful mother fuckers!

42,Coming out as asexual,"I have been struggling with asexuality since grade 8. I have never felt normal due to my complete lack of sexual attraction towards anyone. This has caused me to firmly believe I have a mental illness and made me hate my abnormality for a long time. I would go to sleep wishing I would walk up feeling heterosexual so I could feel normal. (For context I can get romantic attractions. Heteroromanticism.)

This never happened. Thanks to various sites, blogs, and reddit I felt more comfortable with what I thought was abnormal and began to realize it is completely normal. I slowly began to accept that I am asexual, but I refused to talk about it still. While so many people around me would watch porn or go have sex, I would prefer to cuddle girls and avoid porn. It did nothing for me anyways.

However today I told my 'friend' that I am asexual... He told me I have a severe mental illness and should be killed or 'cured of my condition.' I never expected anyone to react this way to me, I really didn't think asexual people would be treated this way. Combining this with other events in my life and I ended up crying in class for the first time in my entire life. I felt so weak and defenceless, I hated it.

44,Still struggling with body image and depression after broken engagement (xpost from r/depression),"Although it happened over a year and a half ago, I still find myself struggling to move past my last relationship. My ex-fiance left me for one of his online gaming friends: a gorgeous American boy he'd never even met in person before. We had been together for 5 years. He began to visit this friend within a month or two of our breakup, to date him within a few more, and married him within the year.


I had (foolishly) sacrificed a great deal for my ex. I gave up the school I loved and moved back to my hometown to support him through his chronic health problems. He had promised me that he would help me produce shows and pursue acting back in Ottawa, where we're both from, but he never did. I had napped beside him in hospital chairs when he was having kidney stones, held his hand during panic attacks, and done everything in my power to be a good partner for him, but it all meant nothing in the end.

When he proposed, he told me he wanted to grow old with me and couldn't see himself with anyone else. The inside of the ring was engraved with the words, ""Love always"". The only explanation he offered me upon the breakup was that he had proposed for ""the wrong reasons"". I feel used, as though I was just a transitional placeholder until something better came along.


It doesn't help that the boy he left me for was gorgeous. My ex would never admit it, but I'm sure it was a factor, and whenever I think of him (the boy he left me for), it just makes my insides turn. As a gay man, I've never felt particularly beautiful. It's a subculture that can, at times, be poisonous to one's self-esteem. We worship underwear models with flawless skin.

I feel so helpless, living in a world where being beautiful gives you such cultural currency that you can destroy someone else's life and no one cares. Certainly, none of our mutual friends seemed to. I know that no one wants to pick sides, but it hurts me that no one stood up for me when this happened.


I used to feel blessed every single day: completely happy. I haven't been able to recapture that feeling since. At night, it haunts me. I think about the man I love(d) with his new husband, and it fills me with such feelings of bitterness and despair. I had thought I was dealing with it quite well (to the point where I was ready to go on dates, even), but within the past month or so it's been striking me particularly hard. I have no doubt that it's been exacerbated by my adjusting to a new city: after the break up, I'd spent a year saving up to move to Toronto to pursue acting in earnest. But between the lack of friends here, the tepid response from local agents and from local gay men, and the anxiety of finding a job and paying rent each month, it's now worse than ever before.


I'm honestly not sure what to do about it. It's been over a year, and I'm still devastated. I keep waiting for some other facet of my life to improve enough to make things better: that I'd land an agent or get some sort of big break, or perhaps that I'd meet a nice guy who's company I enjoyed enough to go on the odd date with. But nothing's happened yet. I've worked so hard to try and better my situation, but it feels like I'm exerting ten times the energy that other people do without any of the effect.",1425537258.0

46,Religion or Sexuality,"Well here is another post on whether to pick religion or sexuality. First off, I do believe I am saved and that Jesus is not my religion he is my savior. And I honestly don't want to give up on him but I get condemned for my sexuality at church and all they do is gossip about how bad gays are. Isn't being judgemental a sin? Not once does it say Jesus hated gays. And it really angers me how in the bible they compare homosexuals to rapists that just isn't right. I don't want to give up on my faith, and I want to get a bible/nursing degree from a bible school and they love me and everything(they probably assume im straight) idk what to do. I gave up on going to church because of these issues and also because im falling behind in school and i have narcolepsy which has been making me suffer. I figured if there is a God he has given up on me. And all of the gays I know tell me to be an athiest. I went to GCN.org and there are so many technical issues on that site and no one gets back to me. Tell me Reddit, how does it get better?!",1355119983.0
47,I'm getting my genitals removed in november. October is ending. I'm afraid of everything.,"Hello. I am an nineteen year old agender person. I have experinced very bad genital dysphoria my entire life, to an extent where doing activities that require me to notice/feel/see my genitalia will make me incredibly upset.

After more then a year of planning and my father's help I'm finally doing it. It feels like I'm finally destroying part of myself that hurts me. But it still feels like I'm destroying a part of myself.

I've gotten a lot of hatred for talking about this with people. I've been told that I'm mutilating myself, or that I'll be unhappy. On an intellectual level I know that it's like saying removing a tumor is a mutilation. My genitals only cause me pain, I am too dysphoric to ever use my genitals sexually, in fact removing them will actually make it easier to have sex as I'll be able to actually be touched down there. 

Still. There's this very basic instinct not to have my body destroyed. And then fears that something will go wrong, I'm going to be cut open (and not in the way that turns me on). Even if there's a 99% chance nothing will go worng, my brain keeps thinking of the 1% chance something does. And the fact that a simple mistake will lead me to never being able to orgasm again.

I geuss my brain is just wracked with nervousness. The reaction amoung people I know is also something I fear. I've been waiting to tell a lot of people, just as from what I know from other people who've had everything removed it's easier to explain to people after the fact. 

However. I know for a fact a lot of people will find out who know me. I've never faced much bigotry before (something I'm weirdly ashamed of), I live in a liberal part of Manhattan, so everyone is pretty accepting. However, many people are 'accepting' in a way that doesn't exactly see enby people as human. I am fully aware that there are a lot of people who will stop being accepting of me as their model enby once they know I've had bottom surgery. There was a time when I thought of the left as less tolerant, now I realize your avergae leftist only sees enby people as tools to further their own egos.

I had similar nervousness as to this when I had my womb removed. Even though that part causes a lot less in the wya of issues, I'm so happy its gone. Just feeling that there's nothing there where my womb once was in my belly makes me happy.

There's also just the intense loneliness and alienation being genderless has given to me. I don't feel like a normal human, I know that this isn't how normal humans should feel about heir bodies. I just don't feel like I'm like anyone else, and it feels like this world wasn't built for people like me.

There are good things. My gf will live with me soon. And that means I'll be able to touch her or talk to her whenever I want. Mabye it's just having lived through a tyrannical lockdown, but that means a lot to me. I'm also dressing as Kris Deltarune for Halloween soon, so that's from.

Anyone have any advice or anything on having these emotions. I feel so alone, and so afraid.",1635447917.0
48,My gf is finally moving in with me. It looks like my life has good news now,"Hey. I'm a nineteen year old agender person. I continue to exist. My girlfreind is cishet. I come from a very liberal area of Manhattan, she's from a somewhat conservative area of brooklyn. 

There was recntly a big issue with her family, becuase they caught me sleeping with her in a way where it was clear I was afab. They're very upset about her having sexual or romantic realations with an afab person, with a lot of her family seemly having a wierd mental breakdown.

Because it's not really safe for her at home, for the momment she'll be moving in with me. We're all legal adults so it can be done. 

I'm happy she's finally able to leave her family, at least to be away from them right now. And it's very nice to be able to be with her. It really hurt to not be able to comfort or hold her directly durirng the days after to insadenet. I'm really happy to finally be able to hold her and hug her again. 

At least her moving in is good news. Though I'm a bit nervous about it. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with living with a girl? Or have any advice on how to comfort her?

I'm also getting my genitalia removed this november. So I geuss there's a lot of good things happening right now that makes me nervous.",1635178053.0
49,Everybody leaves in the end,"For as long as I can remember I've been acquaintances with everyone but friends with no one. I'm M, and approaching my 22nd birthday. I don't think anyones gonna care and if they do its gonna be a hollow attempt that means nothing. I'm still gonna put on a fake smile but I'll know.

In highschool I had a few friends but they faded off into the background and we only ever hung out when I was the one who reached out and even then it was a crapshoot. Now we're strangers

In college I thought I found my lifelong friends in 3 girls but the end of my sophomore year I realized I was again always the one who had to reach out first so I decided to stop and see what happens. And again, now we're strangers.

I spent my whole junior year alone in a single apartment with random Tinder hookups being my only human interaction.

Now I'm halfway thru my senior year and more of the same shit. Making friends with my roommate and my neighbors and now I find myself walking past their door on the weekends hearing laughing and cheering and fun.

The common denominator in this equation is me. I'm the constant variable and I realize that there's some characteristic or habit of mine that makes ppl not want to be around me. I've tried asking what but I just end up getting gaslighted. 

I love people. I'm a social person, I love making people laugh in real life or on xbox or even random telemarketers on the phone. I think to throw myself into my work but whats the point. What will it lead to? Success? Who do I share the fruits of my labor with if I'm a social pariah.

Every day I mutter or even sing to myself that I wanna die, that I'd invite death with open arms but I'd honestly never do it myself. I couldn't. My Dad is my best friend and I couldn't do that to him. Therapists haven't helped, medication certainly won't help, and its getting harder and harder to put myself out there.

I want to have memories to look back on when I'm older beyond staring at screens hoping for someone to knock on my door or send me a text. I'm trying to stay positive but i honestly dont know that i'll ever climb out of this hole.",1615684619.0

53,I can't seem to learn my lesson about unrequited love,"I've been depressed my entire adult life, if not long before. I had my first debilitating anxiety attack when I was 10. These two illnesses afflict me in cycles. I've gotten sort of used to that, and I've made progress in coping. But this month, and particularly this week, has been the worst that depression has ever dealt me.  
  
Almost 8 years ago I met my best friend. My most shameful secret, and perhaps biggest mistake, is that I fell madly in love with my friend almost immediately. Unrequited love isn't unusual, but the problem is that our sexual orientations don't match: I never had a chance. Still, my heart hurts for a dream I never should have had.  
  
We see each other all the time, our lives are entwined. But it isn't until my friend enters a relationship with someone else that I start to feel pain. It's been about a year and a half since my friend found somebody worth keeping around. This feels like a knife in my chest. This is my friend's third and longest relationship since we met, and the longer it gets the more I feel childish, immature, and alone.
  
In this past month I confronted my own loneliness, I've resigned to stop cultivating secret hatred and jealousy and envy towards my friend's SO, and I've endeavored to transform my painful unrequited love into something befitting two friends. But now that I've smashed my illusions (and not for the first time) I feel empty, broken, and completely without hope. Today, I'm back at square one.  
  
I don't know what to do. I have no desire to confess my love, I don't see how anything good would come from it. Making friends has never been easy for me. I've only been able to count the hours until I can sleep again, and hope that my dreams aren't disturbing.",1422594697.0
54,"[rant] Honestly, does it really get better?","[*TL;DR at the bottom for those who have less time to read*]

I know that this is supposed to be the place where people share how their lives improved after they came out of the closet. sad to say that things have certainly not been better; more however things have gotten worse.

Now don't get me wrong, i would change the blossomed pansexual self that i have become to change in the slightest. Being pansexual, however is the never-ending uphill battle that i just cannot seem to conquer. Everyday, another new pitfall rears it's ugly head and immerses itself within me. Not playing down the struggles all quiltbag participants face, as i know how gruesome they can be; none of which i would wish on my most devious enemy.

However, it seems that the most mundane things turn into a disastrous event. Take for instance this: i work in produce at a Canadian semi-national grocery chain (Quebec/Ontario based). in the midst of having a conversation with a handsome, spry transgender (i was asking him for fashion advice; he had the cutest pink sweater with rainbow stockings... i just wanted to snuggle him up... Needless to say would have struck out with him anyways, me not being very photogenic and all..) something occurred to me .Then having turned my head around to see some blue-collar listening in on our conversation. he said nothing, came and grabbed a bag of apples from my cart and left... mostly.

fast-forward an hour, while gathering carts, i found the same bag of apples, the word ***TAINTED*** written on the face. i was disgusted, humiliated and horrified. Went to the store manager, and he did nothing. He cited that people have the freedom to do and say what they want, and that there was nothing he could do about it.

so, why does this have anything to do with this post? the person is long since gone, as with the bag of apples and any trace of anything that would have happened. well, this seemingly odd coincidence is in actuality something that i'm quite used to. You see, my upbringing was not one that was so pleasant. I come from a household where men don;t cry and all feelings are abolished- where problems get swept under the rug and never spoken about again. There were times where food and water were scarce, and even times where all of my possessions were destroyed and lost. I have gone through a hell of a lot to get here.

So to present day, i'm grateful for everything i have. every person i hold close means so much to me, that i often spend time trying to make sure i'm in good standings with them.I can't risk loosing them (yes i know i have slight abandonment issues. blame that on my past abuse). I hardly ever take time for myself, and if i do i'm constantly worrying that the people i love and have deep feelings for are just playing me like a 2-bit violin. much to my dismay, i am this 2-bit viloin that i perceive myself to be.

Now, not everyone i know is like this- i have a select few **TRUE** friends that do care about me. Sadly most just use me- string me along like a puppeteer and throw me away like used tissue when i have met their expectations. I mean, some of the people have gone so far as to avoid me, after i had grown attached to them, then make a surprise entrance stage left with their new paramour, rub it in my face then go off without a care in the world. I attribute this mainly to my personality- he type of person that would give you anything: money, food, the clothes off my back... anything you would need, because i know what it;s like to be without- to have all of your prized possessions, your hopes and dreams be crumbled into a fine dust that's whisked away by the winds.

Moreso, this type of generosity leads me to be the ultimate confidant. I have this innate ability to read people like the back of a book, which does come in handy. However, sometimes this gets a bit too out of proportion. It  gets as far as to know some of my friends favorite *Positions*  for lack of a better word, yet never having gotten tail (trying to refrain from using explicit terms). But here comes the paradox: ""*Does the Psychiatrist see other Psychiatrists?*""

I guess what it comes down to, is that i have no one- not a single person to talk to about my problems. nobody seems to care. it's just the ""let's dump feelings off onto this guy and go about our day"" type of scenario. Me not having many friends, i just tend to deal with it for my sake. Somebody has a use for me, and i'm in some way wanted. That's all i ever wanted, and all i strive for. I long for that one person to hold me closely, to tell me that everything will be ok, and that we'll work through this together. Never in my life have i had this, and it seems as for now that i will never reach it, even at my relatively young age of 19. 

In the end it seems like the last few remainders of people who have interested in me are fading away slowly. Everyone seems to distant to even care so i've taken to the internet, not as a way to get advice but as an escape to my problems, as if somehow they can be remedied like taking some cough syrup for a cold. I feel as if not matter how hard i try, it's just never good enough for anyone. Even if i reach the top of this mountain, would anyone be there to say congrats? or would i stand alone in my solace?

[over 5300+ chars now, let me wrap this up.]

**TL;DR:**
I feel like even after coming out, it's gotten worse and worse over time, as family and friends string me along for their own purposes and not for actual sentiment. I feel annexed, lethargic, severely lonely, and just in need of some true people who in someway really care about me and my feelings. That's just about it.

As an added note, if you read the entire ramblings, i would like to say thank you. it helps knowing that out there, someone is listening. But also i would like to apologize for making your day a lot more depressing and sad. I guess that's just part of my nature",1386125249.0

56,I just remember how soon I'm going to lose my genitals.,"I'm so happy. I'm so afraid. 

I'm a nineteen year old agneder person. I'm having surgery tomorrow that will make me completely smooth and gender downstairs. I honestly don't know how I feel. 

I've wanted this for so long. I know I'll be happier soon. But this isn't something I can ever go back from. 

I keep thinking about all the last times I'll do something with my genitals. My last shower with them is coming soon, my last masturbation with a full apparatus is too. Or even weird things like my last subway ride, or last movie night. It's weird. This could be my last post. 

I sometimes have to remind myself that this is a happy thing. 

I guess this is a lot like when I was about to turn eighteen. I know there'll be some things I can never do again, but I don't think I'll want to in the end, this is part of me growing up. 

I've already had my last Thanksgiving, last Christmas and last Halloween as someone physically female. That's just weird to think about.

57,"I'm so happy today. I just got more news about my genital removeal, its finaly happening.","Wew. Today has been a very much day.

I'm a nineteen year old agender person, and for my entire life (or at least since I reached the age where I was fully human) I've expericed very bad dysphoria about having genitals. quite recently I've recived surgery to finally get rid of my womb. And for awhile I've been seeking surgery that will fully destroy my cervix, vagina, labia, and basically everything other then the clit and ureathra.

This is a happy thing. This isn't tragic, this isn't going to ruin my life. 

I've recently gotten more news about it, and I'm so happy. It seems like my dad has gotten everything in order. I'm lucky to have a supportive family and a lot of societal privlege, and this is actually going to be something that's happening.

There are so many things I'm existed about. I'm going to finally be able to be nude with my gf when we fuck, I'll be able to not be upset when doing things like changing or showering, I'll never be upset just think about my body, and just the feeling of my new parts will be so fun. Wow, this sounds pathetic as fuck.

I am worried about what some peopole will think. There are a lot of people who'll end up know, and I honestly think It'll be better if I'm the one to tell them. Even here in Manahatten (a place where almost everyone is progressive), not everyone is going to understand such an unusal surgery. Even trans people won't nessicarily unstand unless it's explained why this is a thing that makes me happy.

Any adicve for moving forward? And any advice for explaining things to peopole? I'm also willing to answer questions.",1632856705.0

Just bettering people to better the world to better our children and our future.","‪I was addicted to sex, drugs, food, anything that released dopamine in my brain to numb the pain.   I was sexually abused as a child, was overweight since I was 8 ( I’m 24 now ), grew up in a small town which held a lot of dumb backwards thinking people aka racist and sexist so I could never talk to many because people like that, aren’t worth the breath, if you’re dumb enough to hate over skin color or gender than you will not get my time, but anyway my father has dementia & diagnosed w cancer and my mother was in a horrible car accident, leaving her w mental health issues and social problems. I took care of them both instead of continuing college. Now I’m happy to say I’m not addicted or sad I’ve got a control on all those addictions, my father cancer went into remission but he’s got spots now on his lung so who knows what that may be, my mother unfortunately after the accident and me taking her to mental and physical rehabilitation wasn’t able to recover completely.. yes she can function and does her job where she works still, but as for the light, the humor, the conversations and advice is no longer there. Idk who the women is but I know she’s my mother and I will always protect provide and help in anyway I can. I never speak to my friends or gfs how I feel or felt. It’s always too much they’re my age but they don’t understand. They’re kids still and are worried about rappers and social media stuff or were backwards in their thinking somewhat. I just can’t relate to them so I needed to leave go to more progressive thinking area w people my age who weren’t sexist, racist, and carry a real conversation about the world and what they had as goals in life, not gossiping and doing the same shit every weekend w the same people telling the same stories. I never shared a lot w my personal problems I feel my tortured mind shouldn’t allow others in. I took some time away I moved away about 8 hours away by myself for 2 years working in a kitchen as a chef I love it. It motivated me everyday, I used to wake up hit the gym at 5 am when it opened then work at 7am to 8-10pm then hit the gym till it closed at midnight. I loved it. Me being busy helps tremendously. I can fuck but not have to nut 4, 5 times. I can smoke and do whatever w/o feeling I need through the day. Food I work w and I get to eat small amounts every day so it helps maintain cravings and such. (Keto helped me drop over 60 pounds in less than 10 months) So to compensate for the lak of dopamine I work out a lot which releases dopamine. I used to think those first 3 (sex food and drugs) were the only way to numb and get relief. Wrong! I channeled that need and numbness to something that not only gave me that but also allowed me to work on myself.

I think about the people I would leave behind and how much it would hurt them. But that number of people seems smaller every time. I want to know what’s wrong with me. Why is it that everyone I love ends up hating me at the end? I want a reason , an explanation. I honestly don’t know if it gets better. I am so tired of all of it. Everyday there is something new I have to deal with. And I just don’t want to anymore. What’s the point yk? No one cares. No one ever did. And no one ever will.

I just cant live like this anymore. The guilt of it all is even worse. It hurts watching my bf be hurt by not only my sister but his abusive stepmom back at his old house. It all hurts. I dont know what this subreddit is about but I came here to read and vent. Advice is ok too I need it. Thank you for reading.",1589940655.0
62,my story,"Current Highschool senior. Back in Junior year of high school ive dealt with bullying and dealing with alot of family issues. My Mother told me it was my fault that my dad wanted to leave the family. This caused my mental health to suffer and I started falling in my school work. I meet this guy who had his own issues and we got along. He tried to manipulate me and made me feel like the was the only person that gave a shit about me. He was manipulative in the sense that he uses self harm as an excuse for me to stay with them. I felt useless, waste of space. (I GOT SICK AND TIRED OF HIM THAT I IGNORED HIS ASS)   



[Senior year I was planning on just trying to barley pass my classes and going to forever sleep after I got my diploma]


☆SENIOR YEAR ROLLS IN ☆
 I got to meet my internet friend in reaI life,they gave me so much love and support. 

Started talking to old friends who heard about what happened and have helped me in my mental struggles. 

I cosplayed as my favorite character on Halloween and it got so much positive response, I posted a tick tock as a joke of my costume and somehow it gets 80k views. 

I fell in love with someone who actually cared about me. They defended me in Junior year of high school when theses girls started laughing at me when I did bad on my test and they grabbed my paper claiming it was there. They took 3 busses 3 hours away to hangout with me. 

Even though things were getting better I still had the idea of sleeping still behind my mind. some ppl doubted me and told me I was a drop out. Especially this guy. This Guy told me I should just drop out. KARMA IS A BITCH AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS OK TO CHEAT AND HE GOT CAUGHT AND GOT A BIG FAT ZERO ON HIS PAPER.


Even though I fucked up in my Junior year, a counselor (not my assigned one)my school HELPED me get free college intuition and told me I had a bright future ahead of me (they told me its ok to fuck up) my physics teacher also said imma be the best engineer out there.",1586292473.0

64,An open letter to the man who abused me for two years,"Your name will not come out of my mouth, so this letter is not addressed to anyone. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart for putting me through the ultimate test. I left you as a broken, beaten down, and hopeless woman. These past few months have been a rollercoaster of emotions. I’ve been fucking mad, devastatingly sad, lonely, filled with shame and filled with guilt. Thank you for putting me through this test. I have learned how to fight for myself. I have learned that I am a strong woman. I have learned that I deserve love, and more importantly, I deserve to love myself. I’m letting go of the anger that I have harbored toward you. It is eating me alive and it has stayed last its welcome. I feel sadness. Sadness for myself, but sadness for you as well. What happened to you growing up that made you this way? Why do you hate yourself so much that you have to take it out on others? Honestly, I understand. I grew up hating myself. I think that is why I was drawn to you. I thought you could fill my void and give me the love and attention that I so desperately wanted. The perfect storm. If only I knew the price I would pay for relying on you. Thank you for forcing me to learn how to rely on myself. Thank you for bringing out all of my insecurities and faults. Because of what I’ve been through with you, I have begun to be able to address my issues and build myself back up. Thank you for showing me what I will now demand in a relationship, I know now that I deserve way more. I feel sad for you, I feel sad for me. I pray that you will get the help you so desperately need so that nobody else has to endure the terror and horrible horrible physical, sexual, and emotional abuse you have put me through. I am riding myself of all my shame associated with what has happened. I know now, it was all you. I did not do anything wrong to deserve the horrible treatment I received from you. I pray and hope that you will never treat another woman that way but more importantly, I hope you learn to love yourself and take care of you.

65,I no longer feel safe in my country.,"I read the news for the first time in a while. I don’t read it because it’s been scaring these last few years, but curiosity got the better of me. Now I am absolutely terrified of what could happen to me or anyone else that’s LGBT in the coming months. I fear for my own safety especially because I am a lesbian trans-woman, and I worry I’ll be picked out easily. I don’t know what to do. I don’t feel safe here in America anymore, but I can’t just up and leave. I have no hope for the future, and my outlook has turned grim.

66,Long Distance Relationship?,"Well hi. My name's Marlon. I'm 19 years old and just a month and a half ago, a guy I've met and I fell extremely hard for each other. We're both 19 years old and in college. And to give you an idea, we've started saying ""I love you"" after maybe exactly a month. Now the problem is, Peter, the guy I've been with and who is now my boyfriend, is moving pretty far up North in about two and a half weeks from today. We've cried it out, leading to why we told eachother we love eachother, he's apologized numerous times for this and says he understands if I don't want to do this, but if I do, he's more than willing.

I would love to as well, but I've always been skeptical of long distance relationships. Yes, if you're willing in the age of technology today, you should be more that capable. People can wait years for loved ones to return home from the military and it works out for them. But even then, so many around close to me, from my mother and father, my best friend, and other friends I know, they've all had and went through a failed long distance relationship. I don't want us, mostly him, to be sad if it all doesn't work out in the end. I care far too much for him. But at the same time, he's the best thing I've had ever and can't forgive myself if I decide to let this go. I honestly just don't know what to do.

TLDR: Boyfriend moving and don't know whether to pursue or engage in long distance relationship with him.",1497646656.0
67,Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I feel like i'm so burdened down and I need to talk,"So the past few months of my life have been hell.  I'm 24 and an undergraduate in college.  I've still got a couple years left especially with everything that has happened.  My family and I  had a toxic/rocky relationship for a long time.  I live in the Deep South and they're just a hair shy of being reported on the local news as being discovered as a cult.  They see homosexuality as the ultimate sin and perversion.  I came out when I was 15 and they threatened to kick me out if i didn't admit that i was just confused and made to believe that by my evil friends and Satan corrupting me.  So i fell back into the closet.  The next few years were led in fear because they were very clear that if i fell back into 'temptation', i'd be out on the street.  At the same time, they micromanaged me and kept me dependent upon them for most of my financial support.  That came to bite me later.  Anyways, in April we got in a big fight and they threatened to cause me harm and that was the last straw for me.  They'd been threatening to kick me out and cut me off more and more often as I've gotten older because my career goals and political views simply don't mesh with who they are (I'm a liberal that wants to work in wildlife conservation and research).  Anything I said or did that they didn't like was grounds for a shouting match for them to tell me how that  i had to do everything they said or else deal with being homeless.  I had really hoped to suffer through until I graduated and hopefully then I could gain my independence but I just couldn't.  

I've struggled with mental health problems for a decade and I've had multiple suicide attempts that were usually caused by a particularly bad time in my life related to my parental situation.  Like I said, I'd finally had enough and cut off all communication.  They demanded everything back.  So i had to return the cellphone, car, and they wouldn't allow me access to get some of my things so I lost a great deal of my belongings.  I was living in the dorms at the time so I had a place to stay.  Then, since I no longer had them keeping me on a chain, I came out.  This triggered a month of them harassing me and my friends online and stalking me until I got a lawyer involved and threatened to press charges.  

Fast Forward a couple months and I'm living with friends of mine who are in the same town as me/my university.  I have a job and a bike to get back and forth to work (1.6 miles but for a big guy, it's a chore).  I've lost 99% of my family and somehow, several of my friends.  Ironically, they're extremely LGBT friendly, in fact one of them is a member of the LGBT community.  But maybe they just couldn't handle being a friend to me during this time?  I've removed the evil from my life and I'm starting a new life for myself but I'm still so scared.  I still dream about them.  I've kept my new address and where I'm working a secret from social media and everyone but my closest friends because I'm terrified my parents are going to find out where I live and come find me.  I dream about them almost every night and that leaks over into my day dreams.  I'd been doing this before I came out and while they were still in my life.  I thought I could live in peace now!  Also, since I'm now estranged I realize that they could cut me off of medical insurance at the soonest opportunity so I've gone ahead and removed myself from my medications ( an anti-anxiety and an anti-depressant).  Now I feel so fucking emotional and I can't tell if that's because I'm coming off the meds or because my life is just that emotional right now.  

Some things are good...  I get to paint my nails and be myself without being afraid of anyone finding out.  I can talk about being gay or share articles related to the LGBT community on my social media without worrying.  Being myself has made this all worth while.  Right now I just feel like I'm so burdened.  Between the nightmares and the daydreams and coming off of my medication, plus work has been grueling and riding back and forth on a bicycle in the Mississippi summer heat is nauseating.  Plus these events plus the previous years of mental health problems exacerbated by my toxic home life have left my GPA in the toilet and it's going to take me so long to graduate and bring my GPA up.  Some of my closest friends who I thought I could count on have vanished during this time of trouble and I feel so alone.  :( ",1497170598.0
68,"childhood abuse, burned by love, and homelessness.... It got better.","First off, im not claiming I didn't earn or deserve some of the bad in my life. Maybe a third to a quarter of it all I brought upon myself. But it didn't help that my father was quick to pull out a belt or just smack me in the mouth.

TL;DR: I was beaten, made to feel like garbage by my father, lost my family because of a dirty little secret and wound up homeless. As dark as it got for me I kept faith and am still here today a stronger and better person.

As a kid I endured a great deal of physical and mental abuse from my father. Im not going to list all the things that have happened, but let's just say that he liked to hit me for just about anything. I had gynecomastia (spellcheck?) as well so I've pretty much always had boobs. Not quite man boobs, just under a-cup almost female breasts. This was also something my pa would use as a reason to go after me. He would assign some manual labor seemingly impossible to a kid my age and stand there insulting/berating me while I did it.  I think he got the worst about it when I dropped a lot of weight and there was no change. I can remember a night he stood over me screaming at me because I still had a chest. Like I didn't get enough s#!t from kids at school lol. At some point through this, probably 10-12 years old if not younger. I wound up putting on women's clothes and feeling better about myself. Being a kid at the time, I wasn't very good at hiding this and was eventually busted and, well out came the belt again. I didn't really understand why I would do it, just that I felt better. I now understand that it all happened in response to the abuse. That somewhere in my head I felt that if I were a girl I wouldnt have to deal with all the beatings. I would get in trouble numerous times for this by the time I could move out.

I also had one of the darkest moments in my life a short time before I graduated (17-18). In the midst of the trouble at home, barely passing grades, and not understanding why God let my dad live through cancer when he had taken my birth mom that year. I was a big bundle of angst mixed with hormones. Add some serious self-esteem issues and self hate, sprinkle in a dash social anxiety and fear that my dad was right and no girls wanted the chubby kid with moobies and you've got it. I did have friends, it was just harder for me because I would get stuck in my own head. (I'm still sort of a quiet person unless I'm at work) It was also around this time that I fell in serious like with a girl. I hadn't really thought about dating till then and then one day it happened. I wanted her, and I wanted her to know it so I tried my best at wooing a chick. She figured it out eventually and it seemed like I would have a girlfriend. This new feeling made everything else in life ok. It wasn't love, but some serious like. 
She went on vacation to see her dad, but before she left she said she wanted to go out with me, just not officially yet. So yaaaay right? Yeh, she came back and had decided that she wanted to be with an girl, her older not so attractive friend that had gone with her. I didn't know what to think, couldn't figure out why I had been passed up like that, and I couldn't comprehend why she chose her over me. I spent a day or two in my room.... Wallowing in pity and anger I eventually flipped out. Wrote a letter saying I was going to kill her girlfriend, using a lot of derogatory phrases that I would be ashamed to repeat ever. Yup... I was that guy. Anyways a cop came and talked to me and I told him why I wrote it and that I was just angry and had calmed down. After going to school with her for the rest of the week, I couldn't handle it anymore. 

That Sunday at about 12-1 am I tried to end it. I wanted to die so I said ""Fck it, I'll see you soon mom"". I don't remember if I saw anything or whatever after I blacked out. I woke up a while later and upon realizing I was still alive I cried. I cried not because I lived but because I had failed and had been given another chance. And then I laughed because I almost died over someone who didn't give enough of a hoot to have even told me she wanted someone else. I would never do that again I promised myself, not for any person. 

Shortly after graduating I moved in with a friend, and then in with the first girl I loved. There is no story to share aBout her. I loved, she left, I hurt, the end. Most people know the feeling. I hadn't yet known the feeling of falling in love or out of it. I didn't think it would take well into my twenties, almost six years and four relationships later, until I could feel something other than that pain of lost love forwards her.

I was working when I moved back in the final time, and planned on being able to save money n get my own place. Buuuut I was told to pay rent, my whole check in rent, and I did because it was my dad and my stepmom had just recently left him. I felt bad that I hadn't talked to him while I was living elsewhere. End of the month rolls around and he demands more money. This is about the time I realized he was using my money to maybe pay some of the bills that he hadn't paid yet, and the rest would go into his hydrocodone addiction. When I got my next check he said I only had to pay 200 a month now. Holy shatner, did the worst person I ever knew just grow a heart. I said thank you and decided I could stand being there since I could now keep most of my money. Screw it, I thought, I can try to make the father son relationship better, and maybe it was for a while. True to form tho, my father would pop hydros and drink wine coolers all night and when I came home there was always something he was angry over. I mostly just slept and showered there for the most part after getting tired of it.  
He brought a few girlfriends home, one of which I came home while they were upstairs um, finishing up. I wouldn't have brought this up, but I figured I needed a little comedic relief and this was pretty funny also a rare fond memory of my dad. When I came back in I made enough noise that they would know I was home, and a minute later my dad came strolling down the stairs with that ""I just got laid"" look. He said something about the woman was hot, met her at the bar, and then tried to high five me. I laughed and told him to go wash his hands first. Five minutes later and the lady walks down the stairs, and I had to hold in some serious laughter. You see the woman was my friends mom, not that my dad knew that, and I thought it was hilarious my dad porked his mom. So much so I grabbed my phone, found her id, snapped a picture n sent it to him right after they went upstairs. If you don't find that funny, sorry but I do. 
The start of the next month I was dating someone new, planned on buying a dog and spending a ton of money on my girl. I paid dad the 200, and spent the rest on frivolous things. Next paycheck I am excited to take my girl out, and I bring her over so I could get ready since we just got off work. As I'm leaving my dad calls me and puts his hand out as I come up. I thought he wanted a low five or something so I slapped his hand, said see you, and turned to leave. Then I hear ""no no no, you owe me money"" but I already paid you for the month. ""Well you owe me another five hundred by tomorrow or you can find somewhere else to stay"" I just looked at him for a moment, and asked if he was serious... You said 200 last month and out of nowhere you want 700? ""Tell you what, just give me 3 now and you can give me the rest next month."" No. I'm not going to pay you anything, you can't jus demand more out of the blue. ""Then start looking for another place"". I left then, and took my girlfriend out like I planned. About 3 weeks later I went back with a friend who had a truck and didn't say a word as I moved my things out and into my new apartment.
  I was on my own. Living a basically normal life. Pregnancy scare, earning raises, fixing my own car, and having parties. It was great... Freedom. I did lose my girlfriend after a while, in a way I'm not proud of. There was drinking, arguing, and at some point she threw a mirror against the wall and I lost it. I was mad because I heard she had a dude over when I wasn't home, and heard different stories. I grabbed the hood of her sweatshirt, pulled her from the bedroom on her ass, dragged her out the door and into the grass. I felt terrible about it afterwords, but I never hit her , just scared the hell out of her. On that note, if there is one thing I would go back and change in my life, even with all the other things, I would have just left. I would have dealt with it sober, and not given a really wonderful woman what is probably the worst/most frightening experience In her life. Moving on from that....

I didn't talk to dad much then but when I did speak to him he said he was going back to the west coast (where the family is) and about 2 weeks after he left, I followed. I would still crossdress occasionally and I brought that stuff too, but I felt that it was just a dirty little secret and it would stay packed away in my baggage. I wound up staying with a cousin n her family untill my 21st birthday. That day was my first day at a new job, and when I got back to the shop after putting insulation in a house all day, I was strangely happy to see my dads truck sitting out front. I was ready to have my first legal beer, and walked up with a ""hey pops, wanna get a beer"". My sense of joy slowly faded when I actually looked at him. He didn't say anything to me as he handed over a letter. Handwritten, basically telling me that my women's clothing stash had been found and that I would have the shit kicked out of me if they saw me again. He had even told me my grandma knew and never wanted to speak to me either. I had two choices, take a long 3 hour ride to a homeless shelter and probably fist fight my dad on the way there, or take my clothes from the back of the truck and just go. Well, I took the clothes set the bag down to see if I had a shirt to change into cause insulation was all over mine and its freakin itchy. My clothes were wet, and I knew before I even brought it close enough to smell, that it was urine. I wanted to scream at that moment. I wanted to scream that he didn't have to piss on my clothes, that I wasn't some sort of crazy freak, that you're supposed to be able to accept your family if they're different and not hate them. I just wanted to scream. I looked at him then for the last time since. He lit a cigarette, called me a piece of shit and drove off. 
It didn't sink in for a few hours, that I was now going to be homeless in a place I really didn't know, and that I had lost my family because i would do something in private. I was this happened. It's not like I left a bag of panties on my bed for anyone to find. They had gone through my things to some extent. A guy I worked with offered to let me sleep on his couch for a few days when he saw me standing there with a garbage bag of clothes. I feel bad that I forget his name now, but without that offer I probably would have just gone off and let myself die somewhere. I thank god for the kindness of that complete stranger and the people he lived with. The real cherry on top of this shit sundae was that I was 21, but couldn't get a beer because my id was out of state and all I had was the paper receipt of my license. I did receive a text from a family member. It was the other black sheep of the family... Her and her friend had heard what was up and wanted to come get me and take me camping. I didn't like how that sounded though, and the thought occurred that it was a trap. I figured I was just gonna wind up getting my ass beat and left to die somewhere. I don't know why that thought came to me, probably cause it was a day or two after I was kicked out. I did answer, but said I just found the phone on a bench.
 And that was that. I wound up staying till the end of the week working, I got my check and booked a flight back to where I came from. I had a place to leave my things, but not really a place to stay. I could only crash on someone's couch every now and then, maybe once or twice every two weeks. Needless to say but I would have to either walk all night or go sleep in some hidden away place. I didn't even look for a job either because I was so depressed I didn't care. I would do some odd job every now and then that's about it. I was 98% homeless.... It wasn't too bad during the rest of the summer I had ,but in my hometown it snows a lot in winter and gets extremely cold. I'm not sure how I didn't die from it. I've woken up with my eyelids frozen together, woke up under a couple inches of snow, and have been afraid to look at my foot because I was sure it was frost bitten. A few months into the winter I had lost a lot of weight, and was going deeper into depression. Coupled with all the family things and I lost all sense of happiness in life. I wouldn't smile, wouldn't laugh, had a permanent angry look on my face, and couldn't give two turds about anything. 
Somehow in all this I met the woman I'm with now. I'm not sure how or why but she fell in love with me. I somehow went from sleeping on the street or in the park to sleeping in a bed next to a woman that cares about me. It took a while for me to become human again as I was devoid of feelings at that time. It was her daughter that did it actually. One day she made a comment about how I seemed emotionless and and uncaring about anything. From then on I made it a point to try showing I care and to feel something again, and I have. 

It has been almost 7 years since I watched my father drive away. And in that time I've come to accept all that I've been through, and through understanding the pain went away. I see the lessons my misguided father was trying to teach at times, and I see why I did things, why things happened. I have grown so much since I was a child. I was introverted, unable to hold conversations, ashamed of my body, afraid that I would never love, and terrified that I would never be anything but a failure.
Now I'm a chef, most of my working life has been spent in kitchens. In a lot of ways the kitchen saved my life, gave me purpose and a goal in life. It doesn't matter how busy it is, I can switch off my mind and just let the years of mindless repetition take over.  I came into a kitchen that should have been shut down from the terrible way the last guy let things go. Now the place is beautiful, clean, well organized, and runs like a well oiled machine because I've trained all of my crew from scratch. Not one of them ever worked in a kitchen until this job, and now they could walk into any kitchen, kick ass, and earn the respect of their colleagues. Did I mention I love what I do?

Even with all the beatings I myself never really became a violent person, aside from that one time. I do have a temper but it's usually kept in check. I like to offer an ear to those in need or advice to those seeking it. I try to show those who are stuck In a dark place that with a little faith in themselves they will find a way out. I am always a willing friend to those who feel they don't have any. I also write extremely long winded stories of my life for random people to read haha.  
Only a little more to read, almost over,

I still do what cost me my family, but my SO accepts and enjoys it.  As for my family... I haven't attempted contact since and don't plan on it. They didn't render me homeless because I'm a drug addict, thief, danger to society. They kicked me out because of something I did, in private no less, that made me happy. So f#<k them, f#<k my father, and fuck anyone who can't accept people for who they are.  I understand why there is fear in coming out to your parents/family if you're into members of the same sex/similar things. I lost my entire family in one day not because I'm gay, just because I wear a bra and panties. I know that if my son/daughter grows up and wants to be with someone of the same sex then I will accept them and do my best to be supportive and understanding. I will never dislike anyone because of race, sexual orientation, religion, or disabilities. If I dislike someone it's because of who they are as a person or because they themselves have wronged me. The only kind of people I find strange are those who don't like bacon for no reason. That's just plain creepy

Ill give you a second to rest your eyes after that.

 Sorry for the autobiography, I just wanted to put my story out there in the hopes someone can relate and draw inspiration from it to pull themselves through whatever problems life throws at them.


Good day

69,It got better...,"Just wanted to share this...

I have been struggling for months with depression and recently things had become extremely difficult for me and my family. My husband lost a job, I didn't have a job because I was in school full time, our bills were piling up, we were struggling to feed everyone to include my three year old son. My anxiety was through the roof, my depression was consuming me and hurting the relationship between me and my husband. I was doing my best to try and fix the situation, to somehow bring us out of this tailspin... And then it happened. 
Click. Everything fell into place. I landed a job I love, it pays great, it accommodates my school schedule. My husband got a job, his Reserve unit helped him occupy a job for two weeks while we got ourselves sorted back out. I guess we just needed to weather the storm...
Now, while I'm all kinds of excited about this, I'm still worried we won't make our rent come the first (didn't quite get everything situated in time) but I know that from here on out things will be so much better.",1435201226.0
70,"I'm in a story sharing mood right now, so here's my story.","I've spent the morning watching videos of news stories of people being bullied and defending themselves, and some sadly committing suicide because of it. I've heard of this It Gets Better movement or whatever you'd like to call it and I know it's more for gay teenagers, which I'm 28, and straight, but I feel that if my story helps at least one person get through a rough time, it's worth me taking 15 minutes to type this out.

I was bullied in middle and high school for being a fat kid, which I was and still am, which is something I'm trying to remedy right now. I never really got physically assaulted, but I was made fun of for being fat, nerdy and socially awkward. They went as far as making a little song about me that still raises my temper today.

There was one kid in particular that was relentless. Let's call him Joe. Joe was the one that came up with the song, he was the football team quarterback and the popular kid in school. Then one day in the 9th grade I came to school and everybody was completely silent, a grim emotion blanketed the whole school. I distinctly remember thinking saying ""Who died?"" Good thing I didn't because it turned out that Joe had died in a car accident the night before. 

I couldn't give a damn.

Now that I've grown up, I don't think anybody should die that young and it is a tragedy, but back then I was apathetic, and partly grateful. There's still a part of me that does not mourn the loss of Joe. 

It didn't make the pain go away however. I was still bullied. Less so, but it still happened, but by the 11th and 12th grades, it didn't really happen all that often. The kids grew more mature I think, and treated me with respect more often. I still have lingering feelings and social awkwardness that was bolstered by being bullied. Fuck, I'm nearly 30 years old and I still don't like to take my shirt off in public!

I just want to get the message across that it does get better as you get older. People mature more, and treat people better in general. I'm not saying that it doesn't happen, but you have to grow a thick skin in this world, and not just for bullying. So keep your head up, it gets better. ",1404754367.0
71,coming out,"I'm feeling really crappy, so I'm going to keep this sort of short and sweet.

My mom told me that if I were gay, she'd be ""disappointed"" but I would ""always be her son"" and she would love me all the same.

Still, she's said before that it would be devastating, a huge blow to her. On top of that, she's said some pretty awful shit about gays, calling them ""disgusting"" and all kinds of other crap. i can't imagine how my dad would react. He said that he'd ""beat the gay out of me"" a couple years ago. 

I'm planning on coming out once I'm able to financially support myself (or at least until I can stay with a friend until I am). However, I'm 15 and I have 3 years of this shit left, at least. I can't say I'm psyched. The things they say have really hurt my masculinity and pushed me away from them, even though I love them so much. 

I just wanted to share my story with you guys, and maybe if you had some advice, that'd be great too. I recently got rejected by a guy who I thought was perfect for me, so I've been on Reddit a lot, hoping to vent and feel better. ",1395420203.0
72,"Sometimes I want to be ""normal"", what to do?","Obvious throwaway here.

So my story is(Pardon if its a little disconnected):

I'm 22 y.o. male living in eastern Europe. My life is alright, I have a job, get enough money to afford hobbies and I have 3 close friends with whom I hang out almost every week(And chat every day). 

So I'm not lonely or anything. But I have other problems.

I'm not sure for how long, but I always though about myself as a bisexual and I still kinda do, but I lean to just being gay more and more(For some reason, I can't see myself in a *relationship* with a girl, though they still attract me sexually).

And now for the weird part...

I feel very strange, like I'm jealous of other's lives. I see couples and I always think ""damn, they're so lucky"". I've had a couple of boyfriends(None at the moment) and even had sex with one of them a couple of times, but we are no longer together for personal reasons.

It felt nice to have someone close, someone to chat with and someone who understood. But I don't have anyone like that anymore(Unless you count ""internet friends"" from towns far far away, I can freely chat with).

I have no idea what my family thinks about the whole gay thing, but I guess, nothing good. TV and media did their part in building a negative image of gay people for them, and its generally ""wrong"" and ""gross"" to be gay where I live. To the point when you might get in trouble or even attacked on a lonely street if someone learns you're not ""normal"". We had people(Mostly punks and drunkards) beat emo kids and so on.

Friends are pretty much same. I love them and they are great, but their minds a twisted by local society, so I don't really blame them.

I'm not sure if anyone from my close friends or family hates gay people or they just don't like them. Because they joke about them, but once again, ""gay"" is a nation wide swear word here. Even I use it in that meaning.

Right now, I don't have anyone. So I don't really need to ""come out"". I have no reason to. Or at least I think so...

But it still feels weird and wrong.

Now, after two not so great relationships in the past, I don't feel like looking for someone again, only to fail once more. I know I need someone who will share my beliefs and interests and its very hard to find someone like that where I live. Sure, I can hook up with someone for purely platonic relationship(I'm a nice looking and young dude), but that bullshit. I need something more than that.

And I can't. I still live with my parents. I was going to get myself my own place(A huge investment for me, but I thought it was worth it for having my own life), but after my last breakup, I feel really bad and I'm not sure if I need a place for myself alone or if I need anything at all.

73,"And yet, they wonder why I want to leave. (X-post from r/LGBT)","This is a throwaway account. I won't be checking anything except this post with it. Found this subreddit right after posting to r/LGBT. Not sure which is more appropriate.

**Some background:** I have not come out about being pansexual to my family. I have come out to basically everyone else, since my family seem to be the only judgmental people I know. My dad found out by basically cyberstalking me and seems to begrudgingly accept it, but I'm afraid of him for other reasons. My parents are divorced and don't talk to each other, so since nobody else in my family pays attention to my online accounts, nobody else in my family knows. Since I figured it out, I have been debating when I should tell them. My best answer has always been ""after I move out."" I'm glad I settled on that choice.

**What's happened in the past week:**

I've known for quite a while that my family was racist. This became obvious the second we moved from an area that was predominantly black to an area that was predominantly white. I find it hateful and disgusting, but I've come to accept that the most I can do is call them out on it and remind them I dislike it every time and hope they eventually stop.

What I did *not* know, however, was that they have a problem with LGBT people.

Today, my family was eating lunch. My neighbor who is bisexual was mentioned. Her girlfriend appears somewhat androgynous to them (I wouldn't know, I've not met her). Bisexual jokes and ""she might be trans"" jokes ensued.

I am pansexual, which -- while not the same -- is pretty close to bisexual. I have a crush on a transgender woman. One of the people they were mocking is a close friend of mine. Those jokes were like a punch to the stomach. I was left absolutely speechless.

On top of that, earlier this week my mother assaulted my sister. It is me, my sister, and 3 other adults here. My sister and I seem to be the only ones here who think it's inexcusable to punch your own child in the face.

Just....what do I do?! All I can figure out is I need to leave. But, I have no job, so I'm stuck here for a while yet. I keep almost slipping and telling them I'm not straight. They changed the locks on my sister when she left the day my mom hit her, and are threatening to change them on me as well for defending my sister. I'm scared as hell. :\",1362258179.0
74,Worried about the new school year.,"Well, last year was my first year in high school and I hated it.  I moved to a new town and moved away from all my close friends and didn't find anyone I liked that much in my new school.  I was pretty much lonely the whole year except for a few friends that I wasn't very close to that I barely had any classes with. I hope this year is better, but after last year my hopes aren't very high.  Hard to keep a positive attitude after last year.  Also, I think I'm gay but I'm not sure of my sexuality yet and my school is very homophobic.  I know I should try to open up socially but easier said then done.  Any advice on what I should do to make this year better?  Thanks. School starts tomorrow

76,Venting and Seeking Help,"I don't know how to move forward in this world. I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

77,"Sometimes I wish I had siblings to help me out with life's problems. But then again, I am happy being an only child."," 

Growing up, I've mostly been alone. I had friends, sure, but I always preferred being myself. But there are times where I wished that I had a brother or sister to talk to whenever I was down or I was just having problems.

I have my mom sure (my dad left us early) but back then and even now, we didn't have the best relationship because she always judged me, which made me not want to share anything about my personal life.

Life isn't all bad though. There are perks that comes with being an only child. For one, I don't have to deal with the possibility of having strenuous relationships with any siblings. Some are lucky enough to be really close with their brothers and/or sisters, but there will eventually be problems that'll test how strong their bonds are and it's possible that they could be shattered. Besides, I have a good set of my friends now that are kinda act like my siblings so yeah, I'm happy.

I also get to keep whatever cool gifts all to myself so there's that.

So for all my other only children there, I hope you guys are having a good life. Oh, I also made something that helps shows the positives of being an only child. Hope it manages to help anyone.

79,Podcast of my depression getting better,"My name is Ashlee and I have had anxiety since I can remember and recently I was diagnosed with depression a month ago.

I have created a podcast called Riding the Wave which is a series that documents my depression (with mentions of anxiety) in real time in hopes it can inspire others in my position to feel less alone in their struggles and later in the series encourage them to seek professional help.

One in five adults will experience depression. As someone who has experienced depression I know that it is important to have these mental health discussions in order for those suffering to know that it is okay and that help is available to them.

If you are in a vulnerable state I **do not** recommend you listening to the podcast (I cry within the first minute and it could be distressing as it is very emotional). 

I am now midway through this series and I have gotten so much better through my medication and counselling. From the first episode to now I have realised that it truly does get better. Despite still suffering with depression I can acknowledge that getting the professional help I needed has improved my quality of life.

Hey yall,

I'd love to get your thoughts on a mental health awareness campaign I've been working on for the past year. If you're interested in participating, even better.

**WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?**

***The news is killing people.***

When we lost Robin Williams the suicide rate increased by 10%. Marilyn Monroe: 12%. When Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, the hotline got 25% more calls. It's called *suicide contagion,* and it’s the proven link between mass media coverage of suicide and an increase in suicide rates.

Think about it. If a celebrity with more resources and success couldn’t beat it, how can anyone? It makes you feel hopeless. And hopelessness can be deadly.

With suicide rates increasing across the world, we have to do something now more than ever. Something unprecedented. We have to tell the other side of the story. Where people survive and thrive. We have to #ReportSurvival.

***#ReportSurvival***

\#ReportSurvival is a campaign guiding news organizations to report suicide more responsibly. Whether it’s Buzzfeed, the local news, or CNN, we’ll create a media landscape where a story of someone who survived suicide follows every report of someone who didn't.

**WHY SURVIVOR STORIES?**

***Why survivor stories?***

For every person that dies by suicide, another 280 people survive. Many of whom go on to live happy, fulfilling lives. These stories of survival and perseverance hold extraordinary power. That's why they're an effective way to end suicide contagion. But don't take it from us, take it from them:

“Portraying suicide survivors rather than focusing on completed cases in the media is more effective in reducing suicide contagion.”

* *Madelyn Gould, professor of clinical epidemiology at Columbia University and expert in youth suicide*

“Our best answers as to why suicides happen and what we can do to prevent them are not found by focusing on the one person who died by suicide, but by focusing on the living—the other 280 who survived.”

* *John Draper, Ph.D., executive director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline*

“It turns out that, although suicide can be contagious, resilience can also be contagious. And when we look at media reports that talk about people who thought about suicide but instead got help and got better, that actually rates across the population, the number of deaths that happen in a specific area, go down. And we really really want to encourage people to report in that kind of way.”

* *Mark Sinyor, M.D., Clinical Researcher and Professor at the University of Toronto*

“Hearing stories from people who have survived suicide attempts is an important step in suicide prevention.”

* *Professor Patrick McGorry, former Australian of the Year for his services to youth mental health*

“Their stories are not only enlightening professionals who create policies or study the subject, but they are also transmitting all important hope to those at risk.""

* *Center for Suicide Prevention*

""People see stories all the time about those surviving breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and we know what that recovery looks like—it helps people who are experiencing it or someone whose mom just got diagnosed. So many people go through their suicidal crisis feeling completely isolated and alone because they think they're the only ones. But they're not. There are millions of healing and recovery stories—they just haven't been shared.""

* *Shelby Rowe, a youth suicide prevention program manager for the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services*

***Don’t survivor stories already exist?***

When was the last time you saw an uplifting news story about someone who overcame suicide? Unfortunately, it’s human nature to take an interest in conflict, drama, and tragedy. As a result, the few survivor stories that are independently produced are unpromoted and low quality.

Of the content that does exist, ours will be different in several crucial ways:

1. ***Relevance*** \- Instead of one or two, we’ll feature 20 unique stories. This ensures every sufferer, no matter their experience, has something they can relate to.
2. ***Quality*** \- We’ve worked with award-winning production companies, many of whom are interested in pro-bono work. That means we’ll have the best equipment, crews, and directors to deliver quality films that distinguish our stories and engage our viewers.
3. ***Compelling Content*** \- We’ve learned storytelling at some of the world’s most renown advertising agencies and news organizations. Given our experience, we’re confident we can create films that are enthralling, concise, and effective.
4. ***Understanding*** *–* We understand these issues because we’ve been victims of them. Whether it’s suicide, suicide contagion, or depression, the videos we’re creating are films we wish existed when we felt lost and hopeless.
5. ***Casting*** \- Finding the right people is essential. Without a good story, we don’t have a film worth making. That’s why we won’t proceed until we’re completely satisfied.
6. ***Link to Treatment*** \- This is about more than hope. It’s about action and lasting change. That’s why we’re putting emphasis on how suicide survivors got through it, giving concrete examples of how others can too. Each film will link to treatment options and affordable resources to help people take the next step and get the help they so desperately need.

**HOW WILL THIS WORK?**

For this to work, we need news organizations to see these survivor stories and make a commitment to #ReportSurvival. Here’s why it will happen:

1. ***It’s nothing new:*** Media guidelines for how to report suicide already exist. The most effective being the suicide prevention hotline. Problem is, suicide contagion is only getting worse. This makes #ReportSurvival a simple, yet essential evolution of these guidelines.
2. ***We made it simple:*** We'll make the survivor films ourselves. All they’ll have to do is link to the film. That's one line of text alongside the suicide prevention hotline number. It’s that easy.
3. ***Broadcast quality:*** Our films will be as compelling and well produced as any broadcast segment.
4. ***Variety:*** With 20 different films, news outlets won’t have to worry about covering the same story.
5. ***Pre-launch partnership:*** We’ll partner with a news organization beforehand. When we launch they'll pledge to #ReportSurvival, which ensures others will follow.
6. ***PR:*** A well-executed PR plan is essential. In the absence of one, our survivor stories will get lost in a clutter of internet content. Our experience pitching blogs and acquiring earned media will ensure people and news organizations won’t miss our efforts.
7. ***Legitimacy:*** Along the way, we'll get endorsements from mental health organizations like NAMI and influencers like Michael Phelps.
8. ***They already care:*** Unlike the rest of the world, reporters are well aware of suicide contagion. #ReportSurvival is a chance for them to help end a life or death issue they’re painfully aware of.

With that, let’s go over how this works executionally.

1. ***Pre-Launch: The Stories***

***Casting***

First things first. We’ll partner with a casting agency to help us find the most moving survivor stories. At the same time, we’ll tap into our own networks to cast an even wider net.

***Production***

To ensure viewers have a story they can relate to, we'll produce 20 films. Each will represent a different gender, sexuality, race, age, trauma, or treatment. That means 300 million people who’re suffering from depression will finally have access to stories they can relate to.

***Partnerships***

The more help we can get the better. Whether it’s non-profits with funding, individuals with feedback, or production partners with time and equipment, we’ll take whatever we can get.

2) ***Pre-Launch: #ReportSurvival***

***Influencers***

Although it’s not essential, influencers have helped spark some of the most successful social movements in the digital age. Movements like #MeToo, Obama’s “Change” campaign, and the Ice Bucket Challenge dominated the internet because of influencer support.

Given this issue's importance, our connections, and how unaware people are, we believe we can recruit some of the world’s most influential people. Celebrities with their own survivor stories in all areas of life. Oprah, Michael Phelps, Ted Turner, Prince Harry, and J.K. Rowling are just a few examples of influencers who are just as passionate as we are.

***Bring on the News***

As proven with the existing suicide guidelines when one news organization commits to change, the rest join. Doesn’t matter if it’s Fox News or MSNBC, they all want to help end suicide contagion. So as we previously mentioned, we’ll partner with an organization beforehand.

3) ***Launch***

***Wait for it***

Every high profile suicide has lead to record-breaking global awareness, but very little action or change. By launching our campaign in reaction to the next widely publicized high profile suicide, we’ll turn awareness into action.

**WHO ARE WE?**

***I’m Tim***

I spent the last 6 years working at Ogilvy & Mather. While there, I executed campaigns for American Express, British Airways, Coke Zero, ThinkPad, and Qualcomm.

I know what it's like to feel hopeless. I know suicide contagion exists because I was almost a victim of it. And I know how discouraging it is to see countless stories of people who gave up, but none of the people who beat it.

That’s why this isn’t something I *want* to do. This is something I *will do*.

***The Agency***

My digital media company GUSH specializes in social media campaigns and PR-worthy executions. Part of our business is applying our digital, social, and PR skills to end the mental health crisis.

83,The purpose of this sub,"Hi! Quick question about the purpose of this sub. Is it just for people who have overcome depression and suicidal ideation related to being LGBT? Or is it for people who have overcome depression and suicidal ideation, regardless of the cause?

The reason I'm asking:

I have a friend who is experiencing depression with some suicidal ideation. I want to recommend this sub to him because he's feeling hopeless and I want to show him that ""it can get better"", but if this sub is just focused on issues related to being LGBT, it's probably not a good fit.

89,School making me lose self confidence,"Hey guys.

A couple of months ago I was suicidal. School was stressing me out and a lot of family issues came up. I came to this subreddit for help, and you guys gave it to me. Thanks for that
I'm much better than I was before.

I'm in my last year of high school. In Canada, university acceptance is purely dependent on the average of your top 6 course marks. No SATs or anything. My grades are pretty decent if I do say so myself.

Now the problem I am having today started about a week ago. I was in a skype call with one of my friends and the topic of grades came up. After exchanging our averages, I Jokingly asked if I could get into the university that my whole life pointed me towards. At this point, I thought that I for sure was going to get in. However, my friend told me that I was probably not, and told me how she knew people who had much higher averages than me who did not get accepted. This was where my self confidence first took a hit.

On Thursday, our midterm marks came out for each course. I had a 89 in chemistry, 91 in advanced functions (a variant of math), a 92 in computer science, and a 99 in data management (another variant of math). When I saw these grades, I thought to myself: ""not too bad, looks like my hard work paid off a bit, I can work with this"". Naturally, me and my friends exchange grades. Now my friends aren't the hardest working students. One of them just sits on his couch and watches tv all day (so he claims). This person, had a 93 in advanced functions. 

Everyday, I wake up, go to school, come home, and study for the remainder of the day until I sleep. I work as hard as possible, and work any chance I can get. The fact that my friend who constantly watches tv and crams has a higher mark than me concerns me. This was the second point where my self confidence sank.

The third point was the next day, where I had two tests. On both tests, I feel as if I got a couple of questions wrong. I feel as if they both have the potential to lower my average. At this point, I was really questioning my work ethic. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm putting in the hours and the effort but I'm not getting the results that I thought would be acceptable for my post secondary career. I'm trying my hardest, but in the end, I'm starting to believe that hard work doesn't always pay off. I'm starting to get more and more distracted. I have a test on Tuesday and I haven't even started studying. The thought of me not making it to this university seems so surreal. Ever since I was a kid, my parents talked it up as being ""the place"" I was going to be when I was older. My dad said that I was going to go to this university and major in computer science. But recently I've learned that it might not be as likely as it thought it would be. 

A couple of months I was suicidal. I don't feel nearly at that point yet, but I feel like I'm starting a decline. At the beginning of this school year, I was so confident. But I started losing all my confidence lately. Any advice?",1479622506.0
90,I miss my friend,"For the longest time, I've had a great amount of anxiety. I mostly coped through shutting out the world, sometimes by doing nothing and sometimes by being an asshole. I was sad and depressed. I have no direction. My life is composed of a lack of motivation sparked with tiny blips of obsession before I get frustrated and/or bored. 

I had an old friend ( >8 years ) who, in recent years, I've talked to about my problems. She would listen and try to level out my spiraling thoughts. Within the last few months, I started talking about my innermost thoughts. This had the side effect of causing me to develop feelings for her. We were close and had a good amount of things in common, but we didn't really have any chemistry. I knew she didn't feel the same way, so I suppressed it like I did every other bad emotion. I was in denial, and I didn't even know it. 

There was one point where I said to myself that I had to tell her. And after agonizing over my conflicted feelings for a week, I did. And because of my feelings and the fact the she couldn't reciprocate them, I had to leave. That was three days ago. 

I may never see her again, but she's helped me become a better person. I'm a little bit more confident now, and my anxiety isn't as high as it was before. I am more of a people person now too. While she isn't the sole reason for these improvements, she was a significant cause for it. I may have lost her, but I've gained a better perspective of the world. I would never be able the thank her enough for that and neither will I over be able to fully repay her.

91,Lost: Faith in Humanity.,"Last night, I sat in traffic for an hour and a half, got rear-ended at a red light, and spent half an hour circling around looking for parking after stopping at the ATM and Ralph's to buy groceries to make my friend and myself dinner. It was exhausting, and I was a little grumpy, but I didn't let it ruin my 

Either somewhere in the Ralph's parking lot or on the walk to my friend's apartment while I was carrying several bags, the cash that I had just taken out of the ATM fell out of my pocket. I retraced my steps meticulously, but it is, unsurprisingly lost.

I don't expect anyone to turn it it. After all, finding $180 in 20 dollar bills doesn't lead many people to go searching for the owner, but I guess I still had hope that perhaps some good Samaritan would post a sign or SOMETHING. I know that's what I would do. That is what I have done when I've found lost credit cards and sunglasses on the street; found the owner.

I know that I am partially at fault. Shit happens. I know this all too well.

I have been dealing with a great deal of financial hardship, and it is difficult to stay positive, but this particular incident makes everything seem so futile. I recently started working full-time. I hate it. It isn't what I want to do, but I have a positive attitude, and I work very hard. It's consistently noted by those around me, and I find ways to be in a good mood. I wouldn't say that I am an optimist, but I am practical, and I don't see a point in focusing on the negative.

I don't need suggestions of jobs to take up. I already work full-time. I don't need parenting. I don't to be hated on. Nobody does.

I have a college degree. I work hard. I care about those around me. I'm a good person. I guess I am just struggling with WHY I am a good person if so many terrible things happen.

I don't know if I can pay my rent this month now, and I don't want to end up on the street. Which is actually a very real possibility.

I am so sick of trying so hard. I do not believe that good things happen. At least not to me. I believe that mediocre things sometimes happen, but ultimately, I don't believe in karma. I don't believe that things get better because they consistently have not gotten better; just differently bad, and I am sick of working so hard to be strive forward because it really never is worth it.

I just want to believe in the goodness of people, I've always believed in the power of compassion, and I really, really don't have any reason to believe that people do not inherently suck lately. It makes me not want to try.",1414265319.0

I'm starting to question if there is anywhere in this world I can be accepted. I feel ashamed that after everything that has been given to me, that the only thing in the world I want is a group of people to enjoy my company or care about my life. I have been contemplating suicide for weeks now because I believe college was my last chance to make any relationships that will stand the test of time. I can't stand the idea of becoming completely alone in the world and the older I get the more and more I see that is where I'm heading. I'm hoping somehow things get better, but I'm skeptical. I don't want to hear that there is always someone there for me because I know that only to be true if something is wrong.

For myself, the biggest things that help me along are when I feel appreciated.  If someone randomly compliments me, it might not mean much to me.  If someone specifically takes notice in something I do, however, my work feels appreciated that someone's gotten use out of it.  These are the little things that keep me going, that give me hope.

95,"Here's my ""It Gets Better"" message, in hopes that it helps someone.","I wrote this on my FB but figured it might help more people here:

All through my school years, from elementary, all the way through high school, I was severely and cruelly bullied. I was the lowest on the totem pole. The kids who got bullied would bully me.
 
I went back and forth between living with my pacifist mother and indifferent father. When I lived with my mom and would tell her about it, she’d tell me to never fight and to basically turn the other cheek. When I did so, I was a coward and got bullied more.  When I lived with my dad, he’d either ignore my plight with callous indifference or suggest that I pop ‘em a good one. Being a frail little guy, I knew that wouldn’t exactly work either. Plus, when I lived with him, I had a stepmother and two stepbrothers who were just as cruel as the kids at school, so I never had any escape. There was no safe place for me. My dad simply didn’t care and let them do what they wanted. It was pure hell for several years straight.
 
When kids shoot up a school, I don’t condone killing, but I totally understand why someone would do so. I felt that urge myself because people are so cruel and no one seems to care. If you talk to a counselor, they’re rendered impotent to do anything but give useless advice like “just ignore them.” The thing is, bullies don’t let you ignore them. They push and push and push and will not leave you alone. If you ignore them, they get worse. You end up devising ways to avoid them. Some can’t take it anymore and kill themselves, and believe me, I almost did.
 
The only reason I’m still here is because I sat down and thought “One day I’ll be out of school, and I will not be forced to deal with these people anymore. I just have to make it through until then, and maybe it will get better.” It did get better. The years between that realization still made me want to kill others or myself, but I would just go off somewhere and rage. Sometimes it built up and I would freak out in school.
 
There was one day in P.E. where a guy was pushing me around and everything had been building for a long time. I just lost it. I was screaming and crying and thrashing up the lockers, denting them, and completely flipping out. The teacher’s eyes bugged out and he took me aside and asked what was wrong. I told him I was tired of being picked on. He asked who it was and I let him know it was everyone. No one cared and I couldn’t take it anymore. He didn’t get it and simply sent the kid who was picking on me just them to the principal, which accomplishes nothing.
 
The problem was not just with the bullies, but with teachers, counselors, parents and the whole system. No one seemed to care. No one did anything effective. And if you told on a kid, they’d become even worse. It’s a total catch-22 and you can’t do a thing about it. Teachers don’t want to get involved, they just want to go home and forget about these kids. The principal is afraid of being sued and won’t do anything. The counselors have no power and their advice is useless. Many parents are clueless, or they’re abusive, or indifferent, or have useless advice, or otherwise don’t know what to do.
 
People make excuses like “Kids will be kids” and “Oh, you just have to stand up for yourself!” Try being a weak, skinny kid surrounded by people who are much stronger than you and who band together and are the children of rich, spoiled asshole parents who make sure their kids get away with everything. There is no standing up to them. There is no ignoring them. They have to be stopped somehow, and when kids have no reasonable outlet, they lose it and freak out. If school shootings are a concern, stop bullying, rather than focusing on kids who are “different” and thereby making the situation even worse.
 
What happens to these kids are things that adults would never tolerate on themselves. If an adult does to another adult what bullies do to other kids, they would be arrested for assault and battery, and rightly so. I’m all for settling things without a lawsuit, and think they should be a last resort. But, since kids have nowhere else to turn, let the bullies be tried for assault.
 
We simply have to stop turning away from this, as it is not simply a matter of one kid calling another some names. Kids band together and consistently harass and attack other kids who are “different” in any way. Maybe they’re smarter, or dress in something other than preppie clothes, or they’re gay or they’re foreign, or whatever.  They’re singled out and treated in ways that no human should endure. It’s become worse as the years pass.
 
Now, just one compromising picture can be taken of a kid and posted to the internet for the world to see and what would otherwise be a group of kids attacking one kid turns into the entire school attacking the one kid. Who could be expected to take that every day?
 
Since it seems that no reasonable or effective action is likely to take place anytime soon, all I can say is endure it until school is over. It will be hell. It will be anguishing and horrible, but endure. Hang on, and make it through school. Because, after school is over, it does get better. This I promise. You get to choose who you will be around. You’ll be an adult and therefore able to take legal action if necessary. You’ll not be forced to deal with those assholes anymore. You’ll be free! For the most part, anyway.
 
There are still assholes in adult life, but it’s easier to deal with. It’s not a band of jocks anymore. Sometimes people will fuck you over, but it’s not your daily existence. It gets way, way better!
 
You’ll be able to find groups, events, friends and places that fit with you and you’ll find acceptance!
 
See, with me, I was not bullied for a sexual orientation, but simply because I was socially awkward, and a skinny, weird kid who didn’t understand the social roles and rules that others seemed to intuitively understand. I gave my real opinions rather than the acceptable opinions. I was expressive and open rather than calculating my expressions to be acceptable.
 
So, the thing to realize is that the bullies are more insecure than you. They are cowards. They band together because they are petrified of being outcast like you. They don’t have the balls or the strength to endure what you endure. They would rather attack others than be attacked. They are slaves to the acceptance and opinions of their “friends” who will turn on them in a heartbeat if they step out of accepted social roles.
 
You have the courage to be yourself. Or, maybe, like me you just can’t help it. Maybe you don’t know how to be like them or, know how, but have the integrity not to. Either way, you are not a conformist automaton who lives according to what everyone else thinks you should be. You should be proud of that, even if the results of it are currently a total hell.
 
Please endure, so that you can know what it’s like to be accepted. Endure, so that you can help kids who are going through what you went through.  Endure, because the world needs less assholes and more people like you! Endure, because, believe it or not, it gets better!
 
I endured, and I’ve been to Thailand, Japan, France, and Burning Man. I endured, and I have true friends who get me and who accept me and it is a wonderful feeling! I endured, and have had experiences and relationships that I cherish and remember very fondly. I endured, and was able to be of help to others at times, when they had no one else to turn to. I endured, and watched those assholes have crappy lives and in some cases, get what they deserve. I endured, and I was able to write this at age 41 and hopefully help a wonderful, amazing person such as yourself live long enough to enrich the lives of others and to have their lives enriched by others.
 
Some of us understand. You have a resource we did not. The internet can be used against you, but you can also use it for yourself. Seek out those who understand. Reach out to the people like myself who are sharing the message that “it gets better” as not a one of us would refuse to help. We are your resources, and some of us know how to drum up a lot of useful, effective support. We are here for you. We love you and we want to see you grow into the amazing person we know you will be. So, reach out to us, and for the moment, endure.

97,Call for Muslim Mental Health Stories,"Edit: New to reddit - so was not sure  if sharing the handle of the  instagram page was appropriate - but  going to take the risk to share -  the page name is dearstrangerss

We’re launching an Instagram page to collect and share stories that talk about people’s experience with mental health in the Muslim community. It’s not limited to people who are pious or who practice Islam actively, but also a platform for people who have drifted away from the religion and have maybe practised it at some point in their life (been part of the Muslim community at some stage). It can also include people who know someone in this community who has struggled with mental health.

The objective of the page is to start conversations around mental health in an attempt to remove the stigma associated with mental health in the Muslim community and acknowledge that mental health exists and needs to be normalized, just as much as physical health.

The format of the page will be similar to that of Humans of New York (HONY)

We will collect stories that people submit to us that describe what their experience has been like with mental health and Islam, and share them on our page like HONY does. We will have options for people to either share their pictures with us that we can use OR for people to be entirely anonymous (no names, pictures or any indicator of identity).

This is where you guys can help! If you are interested in sharing your story please comment below – you can PM us if you would like our Instagram handle where the stories will be shared.",1611943148.0
98,"We spent the last year trying to make cognitive behavioural therapy as easy and accessible as possible, here’s what we came up with","*This may be of interest to anyone who has had or is having cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).*

We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT.

We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing. 

Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like. 

Two things happened that we are pleased with:

1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions. 
2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy. 

Right now we’re really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We’d be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible.

100,Already struggling to keep my head above water before pandemic. (Long rant because I need to),"I lost my job in November because my depression was so bad and the suicidal thoughts and flashbacks etc I just couldn't fulfill my duties. I then was stuck paying ~$850/ month for cobra insurance until I could go thru a treatment program and get back on my feet. That treatment program promised me that my psychogenic seizures wouldn't be an issue, that they don't discharge until I'm ready and safe, and they will make sure I have everything set up for the next step down. They failed every single one of those promises, but no worries, despite them ignoring my emails regarding discharge papers (that are evidently imaginary), they are able to contact me about for money, for a job they didn't do. As soon as my seizures became a burden and inconvenient, they got a lot less compassionate with me (um, they are inconvenient to me 150% of the time, so kindly do your job and help me), they said they were concerned for my safety the same day they discharged me, they told me to use my ""intense"" treatment time to call programs for them. When I told them I had already tried some of the programs they listed, they told me to try them again anyways. Absolutely zero help, waste of thousands of dollars and a month of my time (2 months if you count the step higher I did with the same company just different building and level of care). 

Time and time again people prove that all I am is a burden. My ex said he will always be there for me, until I went deep into the abyss and he had enough. My dad promised MULTIPLE TIMES that he will stay in contact with me better and he will help me however he can. He fell off that wagon again and again. But don't worry, his fish have a really nice handmade stand, his girlfriend (who he claims had ""nothing to do with the divorce"", but everyone knows he started seeing her before the the divorce was finalized. No, not even that, before the divorce papers were even printed or written cuz this ain't the first time he cheated), had her nails done. I ask him help, literally anything he can so my bank account doesn't go into the negatives and I default on student loans etc. Crickets. It's been a month. 

WHERE IS THE HOPE??

People say that my discomfort around medical personnel and cops is stupid. But when you are in a place where you are most in need of help, having attempted suicide or near the point of doing so, and you're treated as an inconvenience, as a felon, as an annoyance, how the fuck is that supposed to make me want to go ""yes! Thank you for saving my life! The memories of you holding me down (while partially undressed, was being changed into gown) and accusing me off trying to punch people when all I was trying to do was sit up to puke, yeah so great!""

WHERE IS THE LIGHT IN THIS DARKNESS??

People say the stigma isn't as prevalent, but watch the news, watch a crime show, as soon as it comes out that a person has a history of mental illness, that's automatically top priority. Before this shit, I would have been seen as the gentlest person, strong in my faith, do anything to help. Now, I'm seen as someone broken, who must be some ""Reborn Christian"" who found God in the darkness and is now going to proclaim how it changed her life (Catholic since birth, and quite the opposite, the longer I stay in the abyss, the more times I try and put faith in God and doctors, the more I'm hurt, the world has ruined me), I'm seen as on the same level as a drug addict, as a criminal, as an intellectually challenged person. 

WHERE IS THE FAITH??

The world is an awful place even without covid. I hated people before all this, their selfishness, their stupidity, and now even more so. I lost a friend because I couldn't deal with her fucking idiotic posts about how idiot is doing a great job, and idiot did everything right, and idiot is keeping America safe, and we don't need to shut down, we don't need to quarantine, we need to continue life as if it's the flu and just stay home if you're sick. 


People's disrespect... It tears me up inside. I was raised to be kind, to turn the other check, to kill them with kindness. But that only leads to pain, to being treated as a doormat, TO RAPE, to unhealthy relationships, to defeat. 
If I would have learned to be a straight up, cold-hearted bitch, I would have been more successful in life.

I am literally looking for jobs in high risk places, doctors offices, hospitals, post office, etc. Because if COVID kills me, then I didn't do it myself, everyone wins. Give me those dangerous positions, keep the people who want to live, the people with kids, safe. Let me sacrifice myself, it's a win-win situation. I should write to idiot and tell him, he's so stupid he would probably go for it. I don't get why people like him! You can't claim he's doing good for the economy cuz that's in the crapper. You can't say the lives of the people are his top priority, because his top priority is being right and having a lot of Twitter followers, and getting reelected. He acts like a child, ranting on Twitter, crossing his arms, calling people liars if they criticize him (*bratty voice* No! YOU'RE STUPID, DOODOO BRAIN LIAR!)

This world is not made for people like me. People who want to believe that everyone is good somewhere deep inside. Who believe that you can alter someone's natural tendencies by showing them kindness. Who believes in giving the benefit of the doubt. Who is uncomfortable with confrontation or being rude. 

I'm not saying I'm perfect, that I never am rude or thoughtless, but I strive to be a good person and hate when I'm not, when I get angry and lash out. It makes me more depressed when I do.

I don't see how there's any hope in humanity getting better. There's hope in that a lot of companies and people came together to get masks to service (health, police, etc) workers and such like that. But the country is so incredibly divided. How long after countries all open up and return to some semblance of normal, will it take for people to revert back to how it was before, back to every man for themselves.

106,"My first attempt at an ""It Gets Better"" story","After reading the essays in the book “It Gets Better: Coming Out, Overcoming Bullying, and Creating a Life Worth Living” and signing a pledge on the project’s website I was invited (like everyone else) to donate or share a story that explains why LGBT youth need to stick it out past high school. How can my story help others? I started all of this late in life and can’t say, that it was all bad in the closet.  Here is my first attempt at a positive “It Gets Better” message:

Life can be really confusing when you’re young. I was born with a male body and only attracted to women.  I also never thought of myself as a boy or man but my anatomy was an irrefutable fact. I wanted to play with girls and identified with the plight of the girls and women around me, but was never comfortable enough to say what I really wanted.  I realize now that everyone around me discouraged me from expressing my femininity for one reason or another. Most had my best interests at heart because they knew I was sensitive (I cried a lot) and didn’t want me to get hurt mentally or physically. Even today, a time when there is more awareness of the gender spectrum, I don’t think a family member would have said to me “you might be happier if you transitioned.” It’s probably the last thing a parent wants for their child.

Back in the 70s in a rural community, LGBT was never discussed around children or youth. Back then it would have made all the difference in the world if I had known other LGBT adults and youth. I had no frame of reference and never realized that there were other people like me, so I never told anyone. I looked like a white male and was attracted to women; a life of privilege awaited me. Consciously or subconsciously I tried to express myself, covering my dorm room inside and out with pictures of pretty dresses and put on a bra and earrings when I moved in with my girlfriend, but for the most part I kept quiet.

What was the down side then? Why do I think it would have been better if someone had encouraged me to explore my gender identity and transition? Never knowing who I really was I never found my place in society. I never found those friends or kindred spirits to provide support through the years. I also suffered 20 years of depression and suicidal thoughts (ideation). Despite the risk of bullying and upset parents it would have been worth it to be honest with myself, to have friends, and to have all those years of happiness back.

If you are afraid now of what the future holds, realize that it only gets worse if you don’t plan now for a future where you can be yourself and love who you want to love. It does get better when you stop living according to other’s expectations and do what makes you happy—to live for yourself. You can’t help but find support and make a positive change in the world around you when you find a way to take that first difficult step.

107,I don't know why I have intense feelings of shame and ruminating thoughts about lgbt issues.,"Lgbt, can you tell me how to make my ruminating thoughts go away? I don't know what to tell my brain, I keep having all of these embarrassing thoughts revolving around gender related issues. Although ideologically I don't think that anything to do with lgbt is shameful, I keep on reliving these embarrassing moments inside of my head that have been tormenting me for years.

One of them was when I was getting my hair cut and I was telling my hair cutter about my trans friend online and how she's really nice, and how I sort of wish that I was more feminine. That particular memory makes me feel so fucking sick.

Another one was when I was in the locker room and there was this fit black guy with this huge dick and I was like, covering my eyes so I don't see it and he was like ""are you gay or something?""

Another time I was talking to this old friend from elementary school who I was still sort of around in high school but not really friends with. I told him that I think gay people are cool and I talk to gay people online, just to sort of see what his opinion of gay people is. And so he was like yeah they're cool I saw a gay couple kissing in the park and idk why they can't just do that irl. I feel so fucking guilty and sick of myself for even saying that to him though. I haven't talked to him since, nor the hair cutter since. And there's fucking endless memories that assault my conscience every single day.

Please help me make the thoughts go away. I will literally just be standing around my house and the thoughts will come around, and I'll say ""shut the fuck up. What do you want me to do? Just go away you fucking retard"". Because it honestly feels like my emotions are a different person inside of me tormenting me.

Funny enough I'm going to an lgbt center tomorrow to see if I can volunteer. I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay or trans (and I don't identify as trans, I would identify as gender nonconforming), and I wasn't raised to feel that way anyways, yet I do. ",1486331688.0

But im still motivated to learn, try my best, and to push myself despite all of my fears and doubts. I was just in USMC tank school, and let me tell you its been miserable here.

109,Im stuck at a spot where I dont know what to do,"I'm stuck at a bad point in my life. I'm 15, and 100% gay. I have known since I was 12, but I've always tried pushing it back. Ive tried as much as I can but it consumes me. Every moment of every day I'm thinking about it. ""My god I'm gay"" ""I wish I wernt gay"" ""What would they think if they knew"" all sentances in a infinite loop playing over and over again in my head. About a year ago my mom was snooping on my phone and opened my notes, a place where I found sanctuary in being able to write down what I was thinking when I was pissed, or crying, or just down. She had invaded my most private place and read through all that I had wrote. My parents were furious, my dad preched to me, my mom wouldn't talk to me, and it didn't go well. My dad would talk to me in the car and tell me how I need to forget my disqusting lifestyle. Saying how sick my thoughts were. Saying how ""woman is gods gift to man"". And making fun of a guy I had a crush on which I wrote down and said if he ever sees me around that guy or alone with anyone it would not be tolerated. He says that if I ever date a guy he will never talk to me again. He dosent stop and just keeps doing it and making remakes even if I'm crying because I can't handle it anymore. There is so much more that he does it could never be explained. He says ""shes hot"" when there is a woman on the tv because he wants me to think it. He makes my life a living hell ontop the he'l it already was, he sent me to Catholic chuch camps over the summer and making me do it this year. I hate my father. I don't know how I could ever see him agian when I leave due to all the emotional damage he has done to me. To this day I cant look at myself in the mirror and say im gay and when i can mutter the words otherwise i feel sick to my stomach. The only way I can say it is my typing it. I'm scared to go to school each day for my secret will be exposed. I live in one of the worst towns. My school is prek-12 with 600 kids, 200 in high-school and 46 in my grade and nobody has ever been out at my school. I sometimes get anxiety attacks at school becuase i get so scared and worried. I've told a few friends that were okay with it but they dont offer a lot of support and I've even lost a friend because of it but thankfully they didnting share it but I'm scared they will. I wish I could go to my school guidence counselor about it but she is so rude and disrespectfull and I could never open up to her. I don't see whats in my life that's worth living, I don't have any truely good friends who I can talk to and who make me feel safe and my parents never let me hangout with anyone, after what happened, they shelter me as much as they can. After the new supreme court ruling, I thought of just coming out but I never could because I can't have the rest of my family knowing especially my grandmother who would react much worse than my parents. I just want someone to talk to, someone to help me. All my life is, is people going agianst me and trying to make me a different person. I just can't do it, all my emotions and feelings are bottled up inside of me and it eats me alive. I don't know how I can live like this for 3 more years.

113,Moving to college,"This might heavily seem like a first world problem and is without a doubt not as serious as the majority of the posts here but this is a really big thing in my life right now and once again I turned to the internet to solve my problems.

Last year I graduated from HS. Unlike for most people, HS was actually one of the best things that ever happened to me. Elementary school was hell for me, there was no one who liked me, I have frequently been subject to bullying and had no friends. This all changed in HS. I decided I wanted to change everything and I did. Of course it wasn't from day to day but I managed to be a quite social person. I didn't go to a normal HS, it was a grammar school, so it took 8 years. Over the course of these years, I made some very strong friendships and met a lot of people who changed me for the rest of my life, in a good way.

But I was still looking forward to college. I have been aware for a long time that I am gay and did not want to come out in my fairly small hometown. So this dream of a big city came into my fantasy. I quickly chose the university I wanted to attend to and that became my goal. Graduating period was one of the most intense (but also the best) times of my life, looking back. Me and all my friends were really close, constantly together, sharing the same goal.

Then the summer holiday came. I didn't really plan them good so I was bored most of the time but it was OK anyway. I could still hang out with some guys from my neighbourhood and some parties were had, some laughs were had. Me and my friends were really afraid of losing contact so we constantly circlejerked how we're always gonna be seeing ourselves, party every week, all that bullshit. I don't really think I was actually believing it back then myself. 

Then the college started. It's not even a month yet and already I feel wrong. Not depressed, not angry, just... nothing. Every morning I just wake up with this ""Ok, let's just get this over with"" feeling. I have been to very little social gatherings since the beggining of school. I only know a handful of new people and not very well, since we all live somewhere different. We also have very little in common, so the conversations aren't exactly great. I also don't live in a dorm. I don't think it is a mistake, since I'm that kind of person that really values their privacy, but that takes out another possible form of meeting anyone.

I spend half of my week in the city and half of my week in my hometown. So far I have always lived in my hometown and this new setting is very weird. I find myself just looking forward to the weekend just to find out that there is nothing new happening in my hometown. But there is nothing happening in the city either! I still managed to be in contact with my friends, but... It's not the same. When I met my BEST friend after 3 weeks... we barely had anything to talk about after an hour. It was so weird. 

All my memories of HS seem like a dream now. I don't constantly wish ""god, I wish I could sent back time"", I treat those memories as if they never happened. I live day to day, wake up, go to school, spend some time alone since you don't know anyone and barely have anything to do, go back to school, go home, eat, sleep. Over and over. It's only been a few weeks and already it's draining me. 

Oh, and I forgot to mention that the school is hard as shit too. Not yet, no no no, but it will come. And it will come soon. I am not great with handling stress and I was used to a certain system at my HS. I don't know how it works here so I have to work 100% constantly, understand everything and attend every single class or I freak out. Only like 50% get through the first semester. The teachers and older students were very clear about it, repeating it over and over again until I was properly scared.

I think my problem was building up this dream of a big city, where everything will be nice, where I will see all my friends every day and start mixing them with these new people from school, where a perfect boyfriend suddenly appears one day without me having to do anything. I find myself thinking ""What is there to look forward to? If I'm lucky enough to make it through this school, nothing new will come. I get a job and then nothing for a while and then die.""

I realize this is a huge overreaction, I mean I just started. The first week was the worst, then it started getting better, but not in a good way. Instead of turning the sadness into happiness I just started to get used to the feeling of nothing. 

Holy shit this turned into a novel. If you actually make it through my rant you have my respect. If anyone has been through something similiar, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I am really tired so I'm going to bed now. Thanks in advance, reddit!",1413069616.0
114,"It could get better, if only I could find the inner strength.","Hiya

I am 26 and identify as transgender and over the years it has caused me nothing but pain. For all of my life I lived in a tiny little village miles away from anywhere. I was completely alone with these feelings and the only people who ever knew were those closest to me, my family, whom this has always scared the shit out of them.
As such its made me feel very guilty, then ashamed, and now it has all turned into fear which is by far the worst of the feelings. I haven't cross dressed for the best part of 2 years now but I can't deny the internal system of my body which is always silently crying.
I have moved in the last 5 months now to Ponteland which is a little village about 8 miles away from the centre of Newcastle Upon Tyne. However, I have beaten myself up so much over the years that I am far too shy to go out and meet anyone. I don't have any friends and just spend all my time watching youtube on my computer and applying for jobs that I can never get. I haven't been out since I got here apart from to go to the job centre. I can't bring myself to go out and talk to people, let alone in the gender I want to be and I can't see how I am ever going to break out of this pattern. 
Moving here should be a boon for me. There is a transgender support group but I have been sitting with the phone number for 2 months now. I have tried to email several times but it seems that either they don't want me or none of it is getting through. But mostly it is my fear holding me back. I am terrified that someone is going to diagnose me as fully blown transgender and all the things that that entails, but I know that this is an irrational fear as I would still have to be the one to sign the piece of paper but somehow I cannot dispel it.
Also there are gay bars and there is even an event at the end of the month where I could go with a lot of other trans people and blend in safety in numbers but I don't have the inner courage to do even that. I have never been out in a city at night and I especially don't want to be on a district full of drinking people especially if I don't have this assertive stance and I'm caught by some moron seeing me going into a gay bar. 

If I could make my trans side go away I would do it in a heartbeat but I don't think it will. Maybe it will get better if I can find the inner gaul to start going out and talking to people and joining this support group but it seems impossible right now. I would love to hear any advice you can give on making me do at least one of these things because I can feel myself going down another path at the moment where improvement would be impossible.

I've waited my entire life to finally not have a vagina anymore. Like, it's hard to describe, and can sound really pathetic, but living in my body as is has been really hard. It'll be all over soon, it'll all be over soon.

My dad has set everything up to have it done in march. I'll finally have the body I always dreamed of soon. I'll have no gendered organs soon, my crotch will just be smooth skin with a small hole for urine. 

Soon I'll be able to be naked infront of my grilffreind (which is good because she might have to move in here if her family kicks her out). I wont be having panic attacks from seeing myself nude while changing. I'll finally be able to just exist in a state that isn't that of pure uncomfterbility and mascaraed. I'll finally be able to feel like an actual human being and not some sort of deformed creature.

Fuck, it's weird to think about how scary this sounds to most people. There's a weird kind of horible when everyone else sees something that makes you happy as scary. Like, there's so many people here who would rather see me constantly unhappy because I'd closer conform to what they see as normal. 

That being said. I am quite afraid of actually going under the knife. IT's weird to imagin my body cut open (and not in the sexy way). As well as all the stuf my dad had to do to get the surgery done in a safe and legal way (it was a high level white privlege move). But hey, I geuss it's too late to tell him now.

Living in Manhattan I never had to worry about telling people I'm enby. Telling people I've had bottom surgery to make myslef smooth could get more weird looks. I honeslty don't know how I'd explain this to anyone.

126,Why does it get better? Because things never got better for me.,"I keep on hearing ""it gets better"", but that just puts faith in the issue rather than reason. If I know why things get better, I'm more likely to believe it. If you hate your life because of school, once you finish school, all of those shitheads go bye-bye. So, that would get better for most people, but those shitheads destroyed my psyche and made me hyper sensitive to rejection and criticism.

Over the years, it didn't got better, I've been on this rollercoaster ride of staying above 0 My baseline is one, I go to 0 and get back to one and sometimes go to 2 and get right back to 1.

So, with a combination of AvPD, ADHD (of which both are incurable) and living in poverty with no way out for the past 18 years, (I'm almost 30) I think it's realistic to say that I'll never be successful or happy because I have too many roadblocks and there's not a damn person that can help and I've asked countless people and that only solution I can think of is money. I know money doesn't buy happiness, but financial insecurity doesn't help, but the problem is I can't make any in my current condition and this condition can't change with me worrying about bills or being unable to afford a private tutor due to me being unable to work.

128,"Just some ""stream of conscious"" writing...","The hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through was the realization that everyone around me is disappointed in me based on a fact about myself we’ve never talked about and never will. The feeling of liability over something I know I have absolutely no control over is belittling and even humiliating- especially when everyone I love holds it against me and I’m just trying to be the best version of myself I can be. But that’s impossible. No matter what I do or what I accomplish, this one fact will always define me and I am not ok with that. I hate that everyone else can live their lives without repercussion and love who they want to love without it becoming their entire identity. This label is always going to follow me. No matter how accepting our society becomes, I only ask for the acceptance I know I will never receive: my own family’s. I feel powerless and bound by this- CAN I change this about myself? Maybe I just haven’t TRIED hard enough or PRAYED loud enough or FASTED long enough. Is it not enough to truly want to be set free and just be…idk…normal? I don’t know what else is required of me. I find myself hating me for this. How stupid can I be for letting this become a thing? Then I go on to hating everyone else. How can they not see that I have absolutely no control over this? Why are they holding it against me? Why can’t they accept me for who I am? Then I answer my own question with another question: How can anyone accept me for who I am when I hate who I am? But…I hate that this one little fact about me just becomes my entire identification. And there’s nothing I can do about that. It’s hard to be hopeful for the future when I know that I’ll have to choose between spending my life with a significant other or keeping my family.

They are very controlling and force me to give them the passwords to all accounts that they know I have, as well as getting my email on their phones. All they care about is the family's reputation and they are convinced that this would ruin it to the point where they would have to move.

Pleasure to meet everyone here.   Pretty run-of the mill dude here, just emerging from a difficult period in my life.   I've been out of gay dating for many years, and I'm very inexperienced in that area in general.   I'm getting over some fears of living a gay life and  also unrelated OCD, and I'm looking forward to chatting with some guys 20 years plus who are interested in  conversation, mutual support, sharing life experiences, whatever.  Would like to start a journey, even if i don't know where it will end.  I'm a successful person in the education field, but I look forward to speaking with any man in any field or socioeconomic area, from cashier to neurosurgeon.  
I've always had a great deal of trouble ""fitting in,"" with the gay community and my gay identity; dealing with family and homophobic childhood;  uncertainties about aspects of gay sex and STDs; not being someone interested in drinking, clubbing, or fashion; being an overweight gay guy, etc.  
If any dudes would like to reach out and chat, I would truly appreciate it, and look forward to seeing everyone around.

It was originally created with the intent to be reddit's contribution to the It Gets Better Project:  Redditors could share their own ""it gets better"" stories.  It didn't quite launch off like I had hoped.  I think most stories were written in a few different threads in /r/lgbt, and left at that.

I have two current ideas for the future of this group, if there's interest in keeping it alive:

1.  Share the best videos, or from famous entities, associated with the project (Youtube, Pixar, etc.).  

2.  Expand the concept of this community beyond lgbt bullying/harassment.  This would include positive recovery stories from people with depression, alcoholism, etc.  I would hope to work with the recovery groups on reddit to use this group to highlight those positive things, hopefully offering hope to those who need it.

138,Problems after coming out,"Hello /r/itgetsbetter

In December I came out to my parents as bisexual and they didn't take it that well. They would keep pressuring me to promise them that I will marry a girl and have children, that I'm straight and that all of this is just in my head and I need to control myself. That went for few weeks and every time they would ask me to promise them I would tell them I can't promise them since it's not how it works, but they wouldn't stop. So, after some time I gave up and told them that yes I promise them and that everything will be alright.


This wouldn't be as bad as it is if I didn't live with them still ( I realized my mistake too late) and this is very homophobic country ( it's on the Balkan). I am in relationship with my boyfriend for almost two months now and we met only two times because he lives in another country and because of the problems I have with my parents ( they are very controlling and want me to know where I'm going and stuff like that).


I plan to move out in few months, because all of this is giving me too much anxiety that I have to take pills now to calm myself down. I can't tell my parents about all of this cause they won't get that and will probably just laugh it off and think I'm acting childish or something.

141,A poem inspired by It Gets Better,"I do not stand tall

But I do still stand

Always alone

-nobody held my hand

I may not be strong 

But I will endure

I can’t help who I am

-no words can ring truer

Those who would shame me

Do not see my heart

I didn’t WANT to be this person

-her heart set her apart

But you cannot blame me 

For things I cannot change

It feels only natural

What others deem strange

I am a girl living

In the world, same as you

I don’t want to resent myself

For who I am OR being untrue

I’ve had no one to hold me

Or tell me it’s alright

And staying awake and waiting

Has led only to lonely nights

Does it all get better?

Will the world learn love?

I will not go on pretending

That their life is enough.

I am learning to accept

Who I am and what it means

I’m learning it’s not a curse

And happiness isn’t just a dream.

I am learning that the road is hard

But feels so much better than the lie

I’m learning to love myself

I no longer want to die.

The stares, whispers, mocking calls

That bounced around the schoolhouse walls

The lunches spent inside bathroom stalls

Being stared at like an animal

The nights crying because I didn’t have the balls

To cut deep enough to end it all

Gave me greater insight to the cause

Gave me reason to take pause

Gave me a reason to rethink it all

I do not stand tall

But I do still stand

I may be alone now

But someday someone special will hold my hand.

142,IGB: Friends can change,"I don't have a story of being bullied, harassed, or dealing with religious conflicts.  I fairly easily accepted I was attracted to other men.  In high school, there were a few times I was called ""faggot"".  I was oblivious at the time, however.  I wasn't sure if it was being directed at me.  In fact, I thought it must not have been, and completely ignored it.  This only happened twice.  I've been lucky (or, again- oblivious to the fact) in that regard.

I did face trouble coming out to my friends, though.  While most of my friends were either indifferent or supportive, one of my friends wasn't.  He initially told me I couldn't ""be like that"".  Then he stopped talking to me at all.  This made it difficult for mutual friends.  I probably drifted away a bit from the friends who hung around him more.  While they weren't a problem, the two of us couldn't be around each other.

Over time, that changed.  We started talking to each other again, but cautiously.  I stayed rather untrusting of him for a while, and I'm sure he felt the same way back.  It was a very rocky friendship through high school.

After spending time in college, we became very close again.  He had lost his religion (he had been Muslim while in high school), and become more accepting.  Even over the years since, he's grown into being extremely supportive. My orientation is no longer an issue between us.

I realize that many people have it much worse than this.  I just wanted to use this story to say that people can change.  It might take some time.  You might believe you'll always be bullied or harassed.  That's not true.  You will find acceptance.  You can find a happy, safe place, with supportive people.",1295537853.0
