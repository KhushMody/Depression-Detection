> Jaylen Brown’s shoes for tonight


I thought this was hilarious and was surprised to not see it posted

Another tweet might explain the meaning 


> The shoes have a typo, unfortunately. It's meant so say ""Was it really *Naismith"" who invented the game of basketball? The Mayans pictured on the shoes are a reference to a sport they invented and played hundreds of years ago that some believe served as early inspiration.

8,"Terminal diagnosis, going to play OSRS till I die. AMA.","Hey all, I recently got a terminal diagnosis. It’s been a hard few days but now I’m coming out of the initial shock, it’s back to what I know best (Reddit and OSRS..) 

Why am I going to play this to my last day? Because I don’t have long and I’m a bit of a homebody anyway, seems like a peaceful way to spend the days while I become bedbound, and hopefully reach my end game goals 

AMA? Can be RS or life related.

Edit: my ingame is McYorkshire, the same as my Reddit name for you kind people offering to stack me out, I’ll be on sometime today and over the weekend, maybe Sunday.

Edit 2: don’t worry, I do intend to have a bit of fun first too as this seems to be a common comment! But when I’m totally f’ed in bed, I’ll be ‘scapin

Edit 3: didn’t expect this to blow up so much.
You guys are fucking awesome, I’ve really laughed at some of these comments and appreciate the kind ones. Keep them coming <3

9,TIFU by causing chaos filling out an accident report for a boob!,"For once, this actually did happen today and if it matters, I am a boob owner myself.

Bit of history, I work in retail that has a side of hospitality to it (garden centre with a restaurant) and I love a pun, love a laugh and love the people I have the pleasure to work with. Thankfully I’m not the only one who likes a laugh, as today has proved, although one of these days it’s going to get us into trouble. On the other hand, I’m also supposed to be a srs bsns manager and this, probably was supposed to be one of those times but what can I say, I’m only human.

Now, it’s not everyday you have to write an accident report but I’m first aid trained, I’m a bit of a dab hand at them and I always insist on them if someone else has their own TIFU.

Today, it was a lovely lady in our cafe that needed one written up. Fair enough, I asked what she’d done and the words “I have burned my boob” enter the world. 

Between a piece of battered fish, a fryer and some premature ejection from a pair of tongs, some oil splashed up and targeted, of all places, her boob. 

Now I’m (apparently) a grown up, so I break out the official pad and start writing. Usual things, time and date, brief description of what happened and then, of course, I had to detail the area injured. Yep. I had to try and write “deep fried boob” without writing “deep fried boob”. 

Now, luckily I had other equally serious, grown up women to come to my aid and shout various words for boobs across the kitchen. Completely professional, we are! Some strong contenders were “hot tits” and “breastickles”. 

After genuinely not knowing what to put for a decent five minutes, I somehow managed to dress it up as medically as I could and settled for, “chest” but the schoolgirl humour had taken hold by this point.

Usually, I would check the injury but as much as I love her to bits, I asked her to quickly check the area to make sure she didn’t have any burned or blistered skin. Anyone else would go round the back, but not our girl, she nearly whips a boob out there and then (slight exaggeration) and reassures everyone that it’s just a bit red, no first aid or emergency services needed (thank god because imagine that 999 call).

A consequence of accident reports are that we have to discuss what to do to remedy the hazard, which as a group, the idea of adding a coconut bra to the uniform was settled upon, obviously, complete with mimed gestures. Other suggestions of leather and plate armour were rejected. 

It was some point around this time, of course, the boss walked in to a kitchen full of giggling girls, probably not doing a lot of work. He asked, as anyone might, what I was doing. To which I replied without really thinking, “I had to do an accident report for a boob”. He swiftly and not happily walked back out again. Thankfully, he must have missed the worst of it and nobody actually got a telling off but I did rather awkwardly have to hand the accident report to him later.

With it finished and needing signing, the lovely lady in question looked upon my accident report and uttered magic words that I have never heard uttered in the real world before; “this is going to end up on Reddit, isn’t it?”

Now, a lot of the people we work with are younger so I thought I was the only one that heard of Reddit, let alone used it. But lo and behold, not only does she have Reddit but she has 7k of Karma from a comment that went a little bit viral, that I myself even upvoted! This is where I start singing, in my head, “it’s a small world, after all”.

A grand old time was had comparing subreddits we both follow, including this one and with her kind permission, we decided that yes, indeed, this was going to end up on Reddit! 

If you are reading this, shoutout to my Reddit in real life friend and her one burned boob that brought us together (and outed my Reddit account!).

TL;DR caused chaos at work trying to do an accident report worthy of Reddit, called my colleague “hot tits”, nearly got in trouble and outed my pathetically low Reddit karma.

13,I had the most amazing day!,"I’m a school caretaker and I’ve been at my school for just over twenty years. Ever since a new head took over in September we’ve been doing a thing called ‘staff shout out’ where every other Friday (we only do 2 assemblies a month) a member of staff is nominated by staff and students and the winner given a bit of recognition and a free lunch. 


I never usually attend as it’s more of a teacher thing but I was asked if I could pop in and fix a chair. I grabbed my tool bag, walked in and (as cliche as it sounds!) everyone started clapping! 


I was nominated!! I couldn’t believe it! 


I’ve been having a really hard time lately - I lost my son a few years back and due to the strain it placed on us, my wife and I recently divorced. I’ve been living in a house share situation and work is all that’s kept me going. 

I tried my best to stay all calm and collected as the head shook my hand but I’m sure I was a bit teary! 

I’ve given everything to my school and I’ve known a couple of the teachers since they were students themselves so it means so much to be recognised like that by people you admire, respect and kind of see as an extension of your family.

17,Hospital lab wants the blood sample overfilled,"I am a medicine student working in a surgical department in a big hospital. My job is to support the doctors by doing examinations and drawing blood samples.

We had a patient that was scheduled for surgery the next day, so I draw our standard preop blood samples, including a test tube for checking the blood clotting. These test tube have to be filled to the correct line, otherwise the included chemical cannot stabilize the blood. I normally check, if the tubes are filled correctly, but sometimes I forget about it.

I drawed the sample and send it to the lab. An hour later I get a call from the doctor on duty, saying that the clotting tube wasn't filled enough and if I can draw another sample. I said sure, drawed the sample, double checked if it was filled to the line and send it to the lab.

Another hour later I get another call from the doctor, asking me if filled the clotting tube correctly, because the lab said again that it wasn't filled enough. I assured that I double checked. She decided to draw the third sample herself. We went together to the patient and we both checked several times that tube was filled right to the line. We send it to the lab and we're sure that we got it right this time.

Another later the lab calls again stating that the tube wasn't filled enough. The doctor was so pissed because the tube was definetly filled correctly. She asked the lab tech was she has to do. He replied: ""Fill it to the top."" ""To the top?"" ""Yes, to the top. The tube has to be completely full."" 

So she maliciously complied, knowing that you only have to fill the tube to line and not to the top.
We drawed the fourth blood sample on the same day and filled it to the top. The patient was not amused.

An hour later the lab called and said that the test tube was to full, rendering the results invalid. The doctor was so pissed and demanded to speak to the lab director. She demanded that the lab sends someone over to draw the sample, since we seem to be incompetent. 
So someone came over, drawed the fifth sample, exactly to the line and send it to the lab.

It was also underfilled. Turns out the calibration of the analysing mashine was off. The lab director was quite embarrassed and apologized several times.

I am not a native english speaker, I hope my writing is ok.

Edit:
After reading through a lot of comments I wanted to add more information/thoughts:

1. This is NOT a funny story. It is not even traditional malicious compliance, like in most of this sub, where the person who gives out the wrong order gets screwed over. The one who got screwed over was definetly the patient and nobody else. This must not happen again.
I still think it is malicious compliance and I posted this here, because I think there was a lesson learned.

2. The patient was totally pissed, but he was also very understanding and we explained before every blood draw, why we were taking it. Before the second draw, I told him that it was most likely my fault. 
Before the next draws, we also told the patient that we think the lab might have had error. He agreed to all the draws, including the fourth one, where we told him, that we were certain that it would return invalid and we were doing so because the lab told us so.
Of course we apologised to the patient. The doctor talked to the lab director and made a report into the Critical Incident Reporting System(CIRS), to prevent this from happening again.

3. We told the lab several times that the error must be on their site. Even after the doctor drew the blood they insisted that we had done something wrong. The doctor assured them several times we did everything in the right way and asked what to do. So they gave their BS order.

4. This all happend on a Sunday, where we only draw emergency samples and ones really needed for Monday. This probably why it took so long to find the error.

5. We don't use Vacutainers for the blood samples. We are using the Monovette produced by Saerstedt. These tubes have a plunger that you pull out to suck in the blood. If it is full it clicks in place and you can't push it back in. You can overfill them by not clicking in the plunger, then unscrewing the lid a little bit and pushing in the plunger, removing some air. Then you can screw the lid tight and draw more blood. This is exactly what the doctor did.

6. The total volume of blood drawn was about 12 ml, not a lot, but totally unnecessary.
I think they managed to retrieve the last sample and got the results",1682082731.0

19,My manager was fired for appreciating his workers,"Y’all I am crying. I work at a place that’s a large “arena” facility of sorts. We have 3 rinks, 4 courts, 4 outside courts, 3 tracks, and so on. My manager is the sweetest person ever and is perhaps the only “boss” that listens to our concerns and supports us. He worked 6 days a week and this past week on his day off he PAID to rent one of the courts as a surprise to us so that we could play basketball together and bought us donuts and coffee. Fast forward to today where the higher ups have FIRED HIM because apparently they said it was inappropriate of him to host such an event. Also, when they fired him they told all workers (10 of us at the time) to stand in the back room (about 4 ft by 4 ft closet) while he packed up his office which took 30 mins. They didn’t let us even say goodbye. Now they can’t understand why we’re all quitting. Classic “you get what you deserve”

EDIT: basically, we didn’t know what was going on until we watched him walk out. Even then, it wasn’t quite clear. We were told there was a “quick meeting” in the back room and then that we had to stay for our safety. He walked out like a king. He gave us a two finger salute and said “see ya later” like a legend while eating a wrap that the higher ups bought for the office people. I’ve talked to him after this. He is the sweetest person ever and said that despite what happened, he doesn’t want anyone quitting because of him as he doesn’t want anyone struggling to find work. He has contacted a lawyer and he also has his own business if y’all want to show him support I named his side business in the comments. I don’t want to drop the company name that fired him for two reasons. 1. I don’t want them knowing the lawsuit is coming. 2. I don’t want the company coming after me. This is a GLOBAL company and if they wanted to they could ruin not only me but also my chances at my dream job and my own side aspirations. Another edit: because I don’t know why ppl tryna come for me. I was part time now I’m full time as my uni term is up. As I stated above the room was “about” that size.

50,The weirdest thing to ever happen to me as a TTRPG designer.,"Here's a story of the strangest message I've ever gotten, and how it led to the most weird and wonderful thing I've ever done in the tabletop world. Two months ago, I got a short message on Twitter from an account I'd never interacted with. It read:

>Hello Kurt, we are an amusement museum located near Niagara Falls NY interested in having an event around your new TTRPG.

No further details other than a request for contact info.

So I'm intrigued, obviously. I love museums (the more niche the better). It wasn't a totally crazy message -- this was just before the release of [*Here We Used to Fly*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/refling/here-we-used-to-fly), my game about abandoned theme parks and the bittersweet nostalgia of growing up. Part of me wondered if a curator had googled ""theme park game"" and found my weird TTRPG without knowing what it was. Which would be kind of a disaster because *Here We Used to Fly* is not only a weird imagination game, it's a weird, diceless, sometimes sad imagination game.

I showed my my dad and he thought it was a scam. But what kind of scam is so... specific? And even if it was the world's strangest scam, I had to know more.

I sent the museum an email with a pre-release copy of the game. I explained what it was and offered to help in any way that I reasonably could. I figured there was a decent chance that they would see what the game was and politely backpedal... but the message I got back was not what I expected at all.

They'd *already played the game*. Multiple staff members *backed the Kickstarter*. The museum is on the site of a real, historic carrousel factory. They have a WORKING 1916 CARROUSEL. The staff wanted people to **come roleplay amidst their exhibits**, and they made a big pitch to their board about how cool this would be. They asked me to come, too. (They're even paying me to be there, which is wild for a tiny museum.)

How could I say no to that?

And so, thanks to the passion of the Herschell Carrousel Museum staff, I get to both play pretend and ride century old ponies on May 20 near Buffalo New York. If you told me this was going to happen when I started designing games, I would not have believed you.

Feeling very grateful.

**EDIT:** A helpful commenter says I should link the event! Fair, haha. It's a playthrough that happens across the museum grounds, then a Q&A with me and my co-designer. [You can pick up a ticket here](https://herschell-carrousel-factory-museum.square.site/product/amusement-rpg-night-here-we-used-to-fly/1270?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=true) if it sounds like your kind of thing.

56,A guy on hinge blocked me bc he thought I was lying about being a cis woman,"(Just to clarify: I'm a cis woman and I don't have anything against trans women, I support them fully)

After a long time deciding whether or not get on the dating apps again, I thought of giving hinge a try. 

I was starting to feel confident in myself again. I've had prior experience of being bullied in school for looking too manly and being called trans slurs because of my features (being tall, having a big nose and sharp jawline).

But after college I felt much more secure in myself bc I have changed so much physically and mentally. However, this one incident is making me spiral back into my teenage self again.

This was my first match. The conversation starts fine but only after maybe three messages in he randomly asks me to send a voice note. I was suffering from a sore throat so I told him I can't immediately send him one, maybe later.

He then asks me if I'm trans. I tell him no, I just have a strong jawline. 

Without even properly finishing a conversation with me, he accuses of me lying, telling me I don't pass as a woman and I don't text like a woman at all (mind you, I've only sent him like 7 or 8 messages in total at this point). He proceeds to block me before I can even give a reply.

This has affected me more than I thought. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror for three days straight. 

I've known all my life that I don't conform to stereotypical feminine ideals. And coming to terms with that has been difficult. So this is whole incident is making me frustrated :( I thought I was finally happy with myself but I'm feeling dysphoric again...",1682077745.0

63,For those of you who are overweight/obese please do not make the same mistake so many people do,"I saw a horrible post with the same title. Let me correct a few things.

1. Don’t scour the internet for lists on how to be healthy. You will find out quickly everyone with a “to-do list” contradicts the last person. 

2. Everyone is different. Your journey will be different from mine, and everyone else’s. 

3. You know what not to eat/drink. Once you have the motivation you will start making those smart decisions and it will become easy. 

4. Don’t be afraid to indulge. If I’m out celebrating something or at a holiday I eat what I want. Having an unhealthy meal or snack once in a while doesn’t hurt at all. You don’t have to be that person who is a health but 24/7. 

5. The one good the the other list said was don’t try to rush it. Once you have that clicking moment where you find the motivation and start making better choices you will start to see the differences.

6. Find physical activities that you enjoy. Don’t force yourself to the gym if you hate it. Going on walks is amazing exercise and easy on the joints. You’d be surprised how far walking will take you on your journey. 

7. I know it’s cliche, but have fun. Don’t make this a military like regiment. The more fun you have with it the more likely it will become your forever lifestyle.

70,Southern Ontario is unaffordable. At $3400/mo net pay it would cost me 15x my annual income to afford the cheapest home within 100km in any direction.,"I was browsing Personal Finance Canada subreddit and noticed many people talking about affording a mortgage and some of the numbers/equations that get thrown out.

A popular one I've seen is:

Monthly Net Income x12(months)  x4.5 = Home Prices you should be looking at.

Someone with $3000 net income a month is looking at homes 4.5x their annual income, they're being told what they can *afford* is homes in the $150,000-$180,000 range.

Which frankly don't really exist in southern Ontario.

At $3400/mo net income I'm ~$40,800/yr which with that equation would put me at homes in the $180,000-$200,000 range.

Which again, don't really exist in southern Ontario.

I started looking at homes in my area *(hours outside of downtown Toronto)* and they start at $680,000 which is 15x my annual $40,800 net income.

I asked my mother who bought her first home in her 20s and she told me *(and still tells me to this day)* that you should *never spend more than 3x your annual income on a home*.

Meanwhile, every bank and lender I've approached for pre approval has made it very clear that 10-15x annual income is and has been the status quo for many years now.

I thought I had a *good* job relatively speaking. I didn't think I'd need to *""make more""* or *""get a better job""* at this point in my life/career.",1682095805.0

72,"The Nintendo Switch has rekindled my love of gaming, and helped with my depression","For context, me and my wife have owned a switch since 2018, but I rarely used it, until things changed!

So I am 30 years old, grew up playing Nintendo consoles and handhelds, but for the last 6 years I'd been mainly playing PC games. But last year I hit a wall with it, life had changed, my son was born, and using a PC all day for work really killed my enthusiasm for the PC, especially when it came to competitive games, I just wasn't interested in that anymore, and didn't play games for around 6 months ish. My depression was kicking in as well, life pressures were getting to me. 

Late last year, I finally picked up the switch again, I had dabbled in some Mario Kart, and me and my wife completed Odyssey in Co-op back when we got it, but beyond that I hadn't really experienced much of what it had to offer, mostly due to me being worried about graphics and frame rate way more than I should have. 

Anyways, I jumped in and started playing some games on it. It gave me the opportunity to play some smaller indie titles in a way that felt like it really fit, and I started exploring the first party catalogue, games like the Mario titles, Pokemon and Digimon Story really brought me back to what I loved about Nintendo, and gaming as a whole. I'm a gameplay first kinda guy, you can have the most complex, gripping story, but if I don't get to play something that has super fun mechanics and an engaging gameplay loop I'm not interested. 

It really made me feel like a kid again playing the kinds of games that are on switch, and even third party ports are often far better than I had any real hope for. So yeah, now the switch is my go to console. I occasionally play on PC for specific games and genres, but the switch has won me over, hook, line and sinker. Here is a bit of a list of what makes me so happy playing it: 

**The form factor**: Honestly being able to play in handheld mode is a godsend for short bursts or lengthy play sessions for me, means if I am feeling like curling up and relaxing when I've had a bad mental health day, I can. 

**The games:** Honestly this may be the biggest factor for me, being able to play a whole wealth of games from so many genres I love in one place is great. The fact that there are accessible and short games alongside challenging ones is a huge plus for me, if my depression is bad and I just want an arcade game, or a simple puzzle game I'm all set. Add to all of this that the tone of games on Nintendo is often upbeat and colourful, really helps on a bad day. 

**The Community:** Weird one I guess but the community around Nintendo I've always found to be largely positive and a good time to be a part of. Many PC communities are very toxic. 

**The co-op experiences:** I love to play games with my wife but she doesn't play a tonne of games, so the switch is perfect, there are so many ways that I can share my hobby with her in the games I play. 

**The Online Experience:** I know the friend code system is a bit archaic, but the actual experience of games online on the switch is great, and I always have a good time. I'm more into Splatoon 3 than I ever could have imagined, and that's because the experience of it all is so much fun (outside of some server issues).

I know the switch isn't perfect, and it has it's issues (looking at you joycons), and it's a little long in the tooth technology wise, but I can only thank Nintendo for giving me an escape from everything when I sit down to play. It sounds silly, but it has really helped my wellbeing immensely.",1682112500.0
73,Why do hearts have FOUR chambers not two?,"Human hearts have two halves, one to pump blood around the lungs and another to pump blood around the rest of the body. Ok, makes sense, the oxygenation step is very important and there's a lot of tiny blood vessels to push blood through so a dedicated pumping section for the lungs seems logical.

But why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities.

79,Would Love A Blogpost from the Economy Team On How They Feel About The Current State of D2's Economy,"Let me start off by saying that compared to before, I think that Destiny's economy definitely has taken great strides for the better. From streamlining more materials (getting rid of planetary mats was a good change) to lower costs for focusing, Destiny on the surface feels a little more approachable. However, with cores and shards becoming much more integral to the game's experience, there is an underlying issue brewing - I don't think we're getting enough materials as we should be.

Focusing has been a great boon to Destiny, but with shards still being very costly to get what you want, it can feel like you get drained out of shards pretty easily. Cores now being a part of crafting so that you can change your perks can also be very costly if you want to experiment. 

I think it's great that more activities just give you shards and cores for completing, but only getting maybe 4 at a time per strike or crucible match can leave me feel like my time isn't being respected. The feeling is even more intense after completing legendary lost sectors solo. I can get out of a master lost sector with only earning maybe 1-2 cores sometimes, and it feels like I put in all of this work/effort for not a lot back. Not to mention you have a chance to not even get an exotic from it. This makes me feel like Bungie is being rather cautious to give players too much loot, but I digress.

I would love to have a blogpost from the Economy team about the current state of D2's economy. The eagerness of players jumping to a legendary shard exploit to farm currency should state something. Does the economy team feel like players are getting enough? If not, are there any plans in the future to change this?",1682100791.0

85,bad first date revenge,"This isn't a huge revenge like some of the other post I have read but it made me feel better at the time. 
20 years ago I went on a blind date that was set up through a phone dating site. We met up at a nice restaurant that he suggested. He also said this date was on him because he is a gentleman and was brought up that way. He seemed nice enough upon meeting him but when we sat down to order, looking at the menu he commented on how expensive everything was. He then said he was just going to get the burger meal and I should too. I thought okay whatever but when the waitress came to take our drink order, the waitress accidentally brought him out the wrong beer. He was so nasty to her, he said ""this is not what I ordered bring me the right beer"" she apologized she was flustered and so upset. He told her he didn't want to hear her apologies for doing something so stupid he just wants the right beer. He was really nasty and condescending, I couldn't believe it. He then turned to me all normal like that never happened and was like so what do you do for a living. I didn't say much gave him just little one two word answers because I was grossed out by him now. And he kept pushing the cheapest meal on the menu. Waitress brings him his beer, the right one this time and he says ""oh look she can think"" in that condescending tone of his. The poor girl was red faced and on the verge of tears. I told the girl I'm ready to order and I decided to order the most expensive thing on the menu and the most expensive drink and I decided to get the most expensive dessert. He tried to talk me out of it. I ignored him and said to the waitress ""this is what I want, the gentleman said it was on him today, he was brought up that way"" with a big smile. I sat there and smiled and let him talk all about himself while I enjoyed my very expensive steak only giving him short answers. As we were leaving he gave the girl $1 tip he said that's all she deserved. Outside by my car he asked when could he see me again and I said oh he cannot. I told him he was so nasty and condescending to that waitress that I would never want to see him again ever. ""Your disgusting, lose my number pig"". And I walked back into the restaurant and handed our waitress $10 and apologized for my dates bad manners. I explained this was a bind date and his last date with me.",1682083290.0

96,Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,"https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.

At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were ""completely rational and should surprise no one.""

Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.

In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.

""Price wars are breaking out everywhere,"" Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?""

Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.

On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.

Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the ""potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more.""

""That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond,"" Goldstein said.

Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

Representatives for Tesla and Ford did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, made outside normal working hours.",1682082204.0

101,I killed a boss but for some reason all the players in my area are mad at me,"So I am currently level 27. I've done quite a few side quests so I have what I need to fight this boss.

I pulled up to the building that the boss is at, and double checked again to make sure I had everything.

I walked into the building, and took an elevator to the top floor. A player was with me, and was talking to me about how annoying the boss was.

I agreed, as this boss requires many different sidequests to find. And even then, the boss often has high level security guards around him all the time.

Once the elevator reached the floor, I stepped out and saw the boss walking around. I quickly defeated the boss with my high level knife and skills in knife fighting.

But as soon as I attacked the boss, all the players and quest givers there started screaming. The player that entered the building with me had run away and took the stairs down.

All around me players and quest givers were trying to escape. One player even broke open a window and jumped out.

102,Accident??? Crime Scene???,"I was out dashing last night around midnight in a pretty decent area when I had a delivery for this building. It was late and I was on autopilot after being out for hours. I noticed a mess at the bottom of the stairwell where I had to deliver to the third floor so I walked around it and continued up the stairs. Halfway up the stairs it registered to me something didn’t seem right. I turned around to see this…. Yes that is a fresh pool of blood soaking into the concrete.

The longer I stared at it and tried to make sense of what happened the more confused I got. I was trying to figure out if someone tripped? Or if it was some kind of crime scene?  There was undelivered food halfway up the stairs, but the blood was a ways away from the bottom. Not to mention the bloody footprints leading away from the mess. I ended up calling 911 and they said an officer was just there investigating from another call and another delivery driver tripped and fell down the stairs. The dispatcher said they had to go to the hospital but they think the driver will be ok.

115,AITAH For telling my friend their mother is marrying a pedophile?,"I, 24 Female and my mother (53) have been  friends with another mother and daughter for well over ten years. The mothers are best friends and us daughters are good friends. My friend’s mother met this man (60) at a church event and claimed that “it was meant to be,” From the first night they met. It’s now been 4 months since they started dating and they are talking about getting married. I, being a naturally cautious, and thinking it was way too rushed, googled this guy to find out more about him since she had shared very little other than how great he was, (she’s a major over-sharer) he she was so in love, etc. It all sounded very too good to be true, and I was right. The first link that came up from just a basic search was the sex offender’s registry. He had been tried and convicted for being caught in a child pornography ring and spent 5 years in federal prison for it, is still on parole, and can’t be around minors at all or he’ll go back to prison. In shock, I called my friend and freaked out. She also freaked out and called her mom who still has a 13 year old daughter at home and her mom’s response was “I know. But he said he was just looking for someone who looked like a girl he dated in high school. He’s a changed man now and he served his time” 
My friend then proceeded to absolutely lose her mind on the mother because she has two children under the age of two, as well as her little sister who have both been around this man for extended periods of time. Thankfully, never unattended, but still… 
The mother has now ex-communicated the daughter, the mother is now not talking to anyone in my family, and the daughter has put the church her mother and the man go to on blast for keeping all of this a secret from it’s members. (It’s absolutely fucked and why I could never step foot in a church unless for a wedding or funeral) 
The daughter has talked to the police since he isn’t allowed to be around kids, but unless she has solid proof that he is spending time with her little sister, there’s nothing they can do to catch him up. 
AITAH for starting all of this? I feel like I did the right things because those kids need protection, but with him just getting out of prison two years ago and the statistics on repeat offenses, I just couldn’t. I feel bad because I’ve created WW3 for someone else’s family…",1682090486.0
116,We’ve been groomed since childhood to save incels.,"Children’s stories like “Beauty and the Beast” and “Princess and the Frog” tell us that if we’re a young, attractive woman, we must “save” the ugly, secluded man.

“Phantom of the Opera” is another story like this, although not particularly for children, has the exact same moral. If you can look past a man’s unattractive exterior, even if he’s possessive and abusive, then you’re one of the good ones. 

I can’t think of any story where the gender is flipped and the man’s moral character is tested by whether or not he falls in love with an ugly woman. 

Are there any other stories where the young attractive woman proves she’s morally superior by staying with the ugly man? Are there any stories where the gender is flipped that I can’t think of?",1682092187.0

124,Reason for the Shadow Legion abducting civillians confirmed via new Battlegrounds dialogue,"Since many people here dont know why the Shadow Legion have been abducting civs this season, here it is. Its been obvious from all the subtext, but here it is confirmed via dialogue:

- Devrim: ""This tactic of abducting civillians..I don't see the point of it.""
- Mithrax: ""Perhaps the Witness aims to deplete our resolve.""
- Mara: ""Yes, it sees your empathy as a liability, and our rescue efforts as wasted resources.""

Its been pretty clear from the start that this whole thing has been a distraction by the Witness. The Witness obviously has no use for civillians and never did. What it does need is time to do whatever it is doing inside the Traveler, and its wasting our efforts and delaying us from making any breakthroughs on the Veil by having the Shadow Legion abduct captives over and over.

""The District of Columbia Municipal Regulations to prohibit a pet store operator from selling mammals, amphibians, arachnids, birds, or reptiles in a pet store unless the animal was obtained from the Animal Care and Control Agency, a society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, a humane society shelter, or rescue group""

This means that any pet stores that fall under the district of Columbia will be restricted to sell pets. While this may be exciting, it also increases the chance of unethical breeding, or ""backyard breeders"", becoming popular. I hope that this act might spread to other districts eventually, but again, it might cause bigger problems with uneducated breeders in the near future. 

To cut it short: If you are in the district of Columbia, pet stores near you will no longer sell pets. Be wary of unethical breeders and remember, it's best to adopt from shelters.

I’m frustrated, as a matter of fact I’m blatantly pissed. This young man’s story is the same as many others, and unfortunately I’m willing to bet you yourself know of at least one more that can relate. My friend, who for privacy reasons I will not disclose rank and duty station information, killed himself last week. For months he had been dealing with an awful, stressful home life. His wife of only a few years was divorcing him, taking his son, and moving back across the country so he cannot see them. Between the stress of his divorce, the awful things his abhorred soon to be ex wife was telling him, the looming thought of not being able to see his son, and the stress of his job, he made the decision to end his life. His story is exactly the same as both of the other fine young men I have seen committed to the earth. I’m sure he will be counted as another statistic and everyone will say “I wish there was something we could have done” and it infuriates me. 

There is something that can be done. We can treat our junior enlisted without families the same as we treat the ones that are married. We can stop making life in the barracks such a hell-scape that these kids are driven into marriages to people they often don’t fully know. We can provide soldiers with enough time off outside of work that they can build healthy relationships. We can pay our warriors enough that they don’t need to elope to afford basic amenities. We as leaders tell new soldiers to avoid marriage like the plague. We talk the talk, but we do not toe the line and truly provide any reason not to get married aside from the words of caution from grizzled old men. 

You can say we don’t force these kids into marriages, however, the simple fact of the matter is we do. You can say it’s not a big issue, but it is. These bad marriages are costing us mothers, fathers, friends, and family. They’re costing us good soldiers, and they will be missed.",1682099131.0

The Roman gods are not exactly the copy-pastes of the Greek gods they have the reputation of being, but they are very *very* similar to the point where many of them share the same names. 

I just think seeing Kratos’ reaction to the Roman pantheon would be kind of hilarious. He sees these “new” gods and we get to watch him slowly put together how “familiar” this sounds until it finally hits him. I want to see it dawn on him and in his frustration he perfectly calmly walks out of his house and rips a 300 year old oak tree out of the ground 

On a more serious note, if they spun it right it could be an interesting way to show how much the character has grown. He’s faced with the “same” gods he destroyed all those lifetimes ago… what does he do now? What’s different? Atreus meets those “same” gods, what does he think? How does he deal with them?

I seriously doubt the series will ever go for the Roman pantheon just because of how similar they are to the Greeks, but it is fun to think about at least.",1682094632.0

149,Reddit NSFW scraper since Imgur is going away,"Greetings,

With the news that [Imgur.com](https://Imgur.com) is getting rid of all their nsfw content it feels like the end of an era. Being a computer geek myself, I took this as a good excuse to learn how to work with the reddit api and writing asynchronous python code.

I've released my own [NSFW RedditScrape](https://github.com/NSFWUTILS/RedditScrape) utility if anyone wants to help back this up like I do. I'm sure there's a million other variants out there but I've tried hard to make this simple to use and fast to download.

* Uses concurrency for improved processing speeds. You can define how many ""workers"" you want to spawn using the config file.
* Able to handle [Imgur.com](https://Imgur.com), [redgifs.com](https://redgifs.com) and [gfycat.com](https://gfycat.com) properly (or at least so far from my limited testing)
* Will check to see if the file exists before downloading it (in case you need to restart it)
* ""Hopefully"" easy to install and get working with an easy to configure config file to help tune as you need.
* ""Should"" be able to handle sorting your nsfw subs by All, Hot, Trending, New etc, among all of the various time options for each (Give me the Hottest ones this week, for example)

Just give it a list of your favorite nsfw subs and off it goes.",1682108210.0
150,Wife realizes something after 25 years :),"We keep our supply of tissues, paper towels, and napkins in the laundry room, where there is one smaller, lower shelf and one larger, higher shelf. I can barely reach the higher shelf so it is way out of her reach unless she gets a stepladder. The lower shelf also has the laundry supplies so there's only enough room on that shelf for a few of each item.

We were in there together the other day and she asks me for a box of tissues. I stretch up and grab one from the top shelf. She asks ""Why didn't you just grab one from the lower shelf right in front of you?""

""Because those are for you.""

She looked puzzled for a second then her eyes got wide - yes, she just realized (after 25 years in the house) that I always keep 2-3 of each item stocked on the lower shelf so she can easily reach them. I always take from the top shelf, and restock the lower shelf whenever I do.

She had a happy/sad reaction - happy to see I was doing something thoughtful for her, sad because she felt a little bad that she hadn't noticed earlier.

I told her that it makes me feel good every time I put things on that shelf because I do it for her.

She's awesome.

153,[JU] Racism - Why I Left the r/redditmoment Mod Team,"Dear members of r/redditmoment and r/JustUnsubbed,

I would first like to sincerely apologize to everyone involved in a recent situation regarding a discriminatory and prejudiced statement made by our top moderator, Merari.

On April 16th, a user made a submission to our subreddit highlighting a moderator who responded to racism by ironically making a rude, stereotypical, and racist statement against white people. Another user, whom I will refer to as the commenter, replied to this submission with the following:

>*""Fight racism with... Even more racism?""*

On April 18th, Merari permanently banned the commenter for their comment and made a discriminatory statement towards white people. The commenter attempted to appeal, but Merari declined the request and stated the following:

>*""Pretending racism against whites exists is incredibly racist.""*

When confronted by another user for this behavior, Merari became defensive and dismissive.

After this statement went public by the appealer, the community was outraged, and rightfully so; they described it as racism, which most of the mod team agrees is true against Merari, but unfortunately, we can't do anything about it because they're the top-most moderator and ultimately Merari has the final say, a good example being that I was removed from the mod team by Merari just recently because I disagreed with his statement and called him out in our mod chat.

Members started to leave our subreddit and post about it on JustUnsubbed. Merari then stated in our mod chat that he made a ban script to permanently ban those participating on the JustUnsubbed subreddit from our subreddit, and I confronted him on this too. I urged him to make a public apology, but he insisted that he had nothing to apologize for.

This behavior is unacceptable and goes against Reddit's core values of inclusion and respect, it is not appropriate for a moderator to use their position to promote discriminatory ideas or dismiss the experiences of certain groups, but because I stood up against his blatant power abuse and his racist ideology, stating that it's not appropriate to enforce his discriminatory ideology on the subreddit and that all races can experience racism, he removed me from the mod team as a result.

The reason for my submission is that each and every one of you deserves to know what happened and that I owe you all a sincere apology for the conduct that Merari has done.

**Everything I've stated is able to be backed up by evidence, which will be available on my profile, as I may not be able to post links here.**

# P.S.

I want to make it abundantly clear that **any** form of harassment or threats of violence towards the mod team, **including Merari**, are **unacceptable** and will not be tolerated.

We must hold each other accountable and maintain a safe and respectful community. **Sending death threats and harassment not only defeats the purpose of this post but also goes against the values of Reddit and basic human decency.**

I implore everyone to engage in constructive and respectful dialogue. **Any reports of harassment against anyone involved are taken seriously and will be dealt with accordingly by Reddit administrators.**

As the person who brought attention to this issue, **I will be highly disappointed if anyone takes this as an excuse to send hateful messages or engage in any form of harassment against anyone involved, and this does include Merari.**

I cannot stress enough how important it is for us to handle this situation with maturity and respect. Feeling passionate about the issue is one thing, but resorting to harassment or threats **is never the solution**. We need open and honest discussions to move forward and create a welcoming community for all. Let's work together to learn from this and make positive changes.

Best Regards,

Craze.",1682110815.0

165,ILPT Request: my roommates blocked my devices from wifi after I paid for it. What can I do?,"**Edit: a lot of people have asked me why I thought it was okay to not pay for Jan and Feb payments, so I have included the background info at the end!**

English isn't my first language, so please excuse my broken English.

I have lived with 3 current roommates (A, B & C) since August.

Roommates A and B have been living in this place since 2021, so both utilities and wifi are under their name & everyone Venmo them the portion of expenses.

I had an internship from January to mid-March, so I wasn't at the apartment from mid-December to mid-March. All my roommates were aware of that, so we already agreed that I didn't have to pay for anything but rent for Jan and Feb.

When I got back in mid-March, we had multiple arguments, and roommate A, who was responsible for wifi, blocked all my devices from the wifi.

Since I already paid for the March wifi, I asked him to either unblock my devices from wifi or give my money back, but he said the payment was for February (when I wasn't even there) and he won't be giving my money back. I called customer service, but they said they can't do anything without the security code, which only roommate A knows.

What should I do in this situation?

p.s. Just in case people tell me to try to have a conversation with him, he already cussed me out, locked me out of the apartment, and possibly turned my electricity off (breaker box). I do not feel safe having a conversation with him and I don't even think it will be possible to have a conversation with him anyways.

Edited (added more background info): 

>I did pay my rent.  
>  
>All my roommates and I have been splitting utilities and internet between people actively living in the apartment. For example, one of the roommates is leaving early for summer break, so she won't be paying for utilities and internet from April to July.  
>  
>This was already established even before I moved in, and everyone agreed on me not paying Jan and Feb payments before I left because of that.  
>  
>Also, the thing is none of my roommates had any problems with me not paying for Jan and Feb (because it has been working like that). Even roommate A specifically said ""I need $xx from everyone for wifi (except \[my name\]) by the 22nd"" when I wasn't there.  
>  
>He only started claiming that my payment was for February when I asked him to return my money or unblock my devices from the wifi.",1682088670.0

169,The Dm is making us really uncomfortable.,"Hi everybody.
So, we have a set-up, with 4 players (3 boys and 1 girl), and, of course the dm. He is a first-time DM, and we are experienced players except for the girl (this is her first time playing). And, the DM always makes inappropriate jokes/scenarios. For example, giving the girl player a stick, with this description: ""The more you play with it, the harder it gets"" or, making her having lesbian s*x, with a prostitute (I am not jokin). And, I talked to the girl after our second session, and she said, that she feels really bad. She loves the game, and our team, but, the constant sexual harassment is ruining her first campaign. 
We, the boys, are trying, to distract the DM, but, nothing works. He keeps on going. (I mean, this guy wanted me, to open a door, where a man have sexual contact with a goat. What the hell??)

Sorry, It was a bit long, but, I need your help, or advice. What should we do? Address all the problems to the dm? Because, there are several other problems to, but, this is the biggest issue.

But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We'd never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we'd made was for a failed hard drive many years ago.

176,How I got back at a pushy guy on a bad first date,"When I was 18 years old (10 years ago) I was doing the online dating thing. I live in the US and am about 15 min from the Canadian border. My date and I went to Canada together on a first date because I couldn't drink in the US but could in Canada and we wanted to go to a bar / casino. 

He picked me up in his little sports car and we rode together through the border crossing and to the casino. We played some games and had some drinks and were having a decent time. I got to a point where I was decently drunk and knew if I had any more alcohol I would be out of commission. I told my date I was done drinking and wanted to start heading home. Instead of listening to me he went and got us both another round of drinks and he handed me a big long island iced tea. 

I told him point blank I couldn't drink it because I was at my limit. He didn't take too kindly to that and got pushy. He told me ""you have to drink it. I bought it for you. If you don't drink it you're going to make me waste money."" No matter how many times I told him no, he continued to push me on this. I got very frustrated and upset because I was alone with this pushy man in another country and I was very upset with myself for getting into this situation. 

We argued for a while and eventually I snapped and formulated a little plan. He agreed to take me home after I finished the drink. I took the drink from him and chugged it. We got into his car and started for the border. It's important to note that this guy was VERY proud of his car. He spent the whole drive to the border telling me about all the features and how much he loved it. I spent the whole drive ignoring him and focusing on keeping my sick stomach under control. My goal was to make it through the border crossing at least which was proving pretty difficult. 

We did eventually make it through the border crossing and as SOON as we made it back to the US I turned in my seat to look him in the eyes and I told him, ""I didn't appreciate how you forced alcohol down my throat after I repeatedly told you no. I know my limits and you ignored and disrespected me. I said I couldn't drink more for a REASON.""  Then, while maintaining direct eye contact with him, I started vomiting in his car. I knew this was coming and specifically oriented myself to cause as much damage as possible. I threw up on the seat, the floor, the dash, etc. He was FREAKING out and I just started crying and telling him this was his fault and he could either take me home or let me out of the car now but I will call the police if he doesn't proceed with one of the two options. 

He dropped me off at home and I never saw him again 🥰",1682047068.0

180,Why is anyone buying condos in Toronto still? Here's the math I did.,"Here's my math on purchasing a condo. While it's not necessarily applicable for *all* condos, I looked at quite a few and the numbers hold up for a lot of them.

Condo Sale Price: $850,000

Rental Price for Identical Unit: $2800

Financials for purchasing the units:

Down payment = $100,000

Land Transfer (first time homebuyer) + Lawyers Fees = $18,475 + 2000 = $20,475

Mortgage payments for $750,000 @ 5.5% amortized 25 yrs = $4731/month ($3335/month is interest)

Property Tax (approx): $3000/year = $250/month

Condo fees: $450/month

Now, what we need to do is calculate how much irrecoverable money you're losing each month for renting vs. buying.

For renting it's easy, you lose your rent each month. I'm not counting utilities because that's equal for both. So for renting, you lose **$2800**.

For buying, you would only count the interest you pay (which I averaged over the first five years), and then everything else I listed: $3335 + $250 + $450 = $4035

Now, we need to also calculate how much money you're losing with your down payment and closing fees (ie. your opportunity cost). If you took that amount and invested in GICs, you'll get \~4.8%, so approx $120,475 \* .048 /12 = $481.90

So essentially, you're *also* losing $481.90 per month by having that money locked up in your condo and not invested elsewhere.

That gives us a total of $4035+$482 = **$4517** that you're losing *every month* by purchasing the condo.

To be fair now, condos do usually appreciate in value in Toronto. Let's be super generous and say it'll go up 5% every year. At the end of 5 years, it'll be worth $1,084,839. So you're looking at appreciation of $1,084,839-$850,000 = $234,839. That's about $3,913/month in appreciation *if any only if* your condo goes up 5% per year *every year for five years.*

If you *deduct* that from what you're losing on paper each month from the condo, then you get $4517 - $3913 = **$604**

So, in conclusion, on paper you lose a hell of a lot more by buying a condo: $2800 loss per month renting vs. $4517 loss per month by buying. But if you factor in a 5% increase in value each year for your condo, then that brings it down to a $604 loss, which heavily favors purchasing.

HOWEVER, if you want to factor in inflation (let's say 2.5%), then your condo is only really increasing 2.5% per year (5% - 2.5% = 2.5%). They your condo is only going up in value to $961,697 after 5 years, or only $1,861. So that gives you a loss of $4517-$1861 = $2656 per month for buying.

So, with inflation, you're somewhat equal to renting (plus or minus small adjustments for condo fees, property taxes, etc.). And I also didn't count maintenance, which I *just* realized. If you spend $150/month on maintenance it's almost exactly even then.

What are your thoughts? Did I miss anything?

EDIT: Holy crap I didn't expect this many responses. Thanks so much for your feedback everyone. Some *really* good comments. I'll try to respond when I have more time. I think one thing is clear though, there's definitely no black and white when it comes to ownership vs. renting.",1682086543.0

187,Just a heads up. If you've been waiting a long time in the ER it's because you're not an Emergency,"People need to realize that the ER is for emergencies (it's right in the name).

This idea that everyone who walks in the door is going to be next to see a doctor is just a little naive and unrealistic. I know you think your sprained thumb is devastatingly painful but it's not an emergency... expect to wait... it's called triaging.

Heart is fluttering and lips are blue... Emergency

Spike in head... Emergency

Car accident with internal trauma... Emergency

I threw up twice today... NOT Emergency

I think a lot of the load and wait in the ER could be helped if people would look up ""emergency"" in a dictionary and self evaluate if a really bad sinus headache qualifies.

Prescription refill... expect to wait... actually, maybe bring breakfast... for tomorrow

Yelling at the nurse that you can't breathe... expect to wait... if you can yell your breathing is just fine

189,On a post about how morbidly obese people have sex,"Had a patient once. He told me once how he and his also very morbidly obese wife have sexy time. The first method was to go furniture shopping. Preferably solid wood type and find the best sturdy dinning room table you can afford. The caveat is you to get one with the removable leaves. The center sections for expanding the table length. 

Once time for the moment you take your special lady to the dinning room table. Remove all the leaves from the table. Then proceed to bend her over the table. Putting all her front goodies through the empty section of the table while her arms are braced on either side so you can now have full access to her hind quarters. Once she is good and n ready. You go ahead and lift your massive stomach and fupa on her back and use your dick sonar to find her wet dark abyss and rail away like you might die from a massive coronary heart attack in the White Castle parking lot the next day.

Bonus round is he also told me sometimes he would ask his neighbor to help out. Having his friend use a broom stick to hold up his wife's goodies so he may gain access to the yeasty goodness...

194,The 3 walks you should take your dog on every day,"Or at least, the 3 walks I’ve been taking my dog on that I’ve been having great success with that I wanted to share.

**Morning Walk: Tire her out**. That’s the whole goal of the first walk. I’ve been taking her to a fenced in playground or field and playing with her with a flirt pole. It’s her favorite toy and it gets her exhausted in minutes. Obviously you could play fetch, go running, have a dog play date or a million other things, but I’ve found it really good to tire her out as early as possible so she’s not frantic throughout the day. 

**Afternoon Walk: Stay calm**. This walk involves the least amount of movement on her part. I’ve been taking her to busier places, particular those with kids or other dogs (two things she gets very excited about) and just asking her to maintain a down stay while I act like a vending machine so long as she stays calm. I want to start adding some focused heel walking in busier locations to this because we live in NYC and she needs to be better at quickly moving through crowds without getting distracted. When she gets really good I’ll turn them into public training sessions w/ distractions.

**Evening walk: Recall**. Whoa, an entire walk just for one skill? Yes. Nearby me there’s a soccer field, baseball field, and a dog park that are usually empty around this time. I’ll take her there and take off her leash and just release her to run around and sniff. Every now and then I’ll recall her & if she turns around and runs to me I reward & praise and then immediately release her back. In the beginning I kept her on a long line until I trusted her to come back consistently. She’s really a pro at this point. The other day she was face to face with another dog (through a fence) but when I recalled her she immediately turned around and darted the entire length of the baseball field towards me.

Edit: I don’t have a yard so 3 walks a day are pretty necessary just so she can use the bathroom. If I’m really busy walks 2 & 3 can be shorter. 5 minutes of her in a down stay as people pass her or 5 minutes of recall work is good too.",1682093051.0
195,Drank with my wife last night,"Asked my wife to pick up beer and a nip of jack honey on her way home. Had 3 blue moons and the nip. Felt amazing, had an awesome conversation on the front porch. Drank water and took tylenol before bed. Woke up at 3am feeling like garbage, went back to bed and didnt feel as bad when I woke up in the morning.107 days I did not have a drop of alcohol, but now I guess I am back at day 1.

I feel ashamed, but not because of the physical act of drinking. I didnt hurt anybody, I didnt do anything 'wrong'.

I feel ashamed because I know deep down that sobriety genuinely makes me happy. I am happier when I am sober. I am very conflicted, the battle in my head thats weighs the pros and cons of drinking or not drinking rages on. What the fuck.

I wish I could either:

A. Be OK with drinking and not feel bad about it, or

B. Just not drink ever again.

&#x200B;

What the fuck. Should I start back at day 1 or just give up counting?

From the bottom of my heart I hope that I will not drink with you tonight.

EDIT: First of all, thank you to everyone who commented on this, I appreciate it. Also I just checked the bottle of what I took last night, and it was Ibruprofen, not Tylenol. Sorry for scaring everyone lol.

And to everyone saying that I shouldn't count the days, I have tried not counting and it never works. Everytime I see the day counter hit a little milestone like 10, 20, 100, it feels amazing. I was at somewhere around 800 days (a few weeks shy of 2 years) before, and it was great. Then I drank for 5 months, and ended up quitting 107 days ago.Yes, I did reset my day counting app to 0 and I am proud of it. For me, having a day counter (even at 0 days) is a lot better than not counting days and just drinking again.

One thing that did make a huge difference in my mood today was I recorded a video for myself in the future. I explained how emotionally I felt like I was lying on my back in the bottom of a pit. The reasoning is that next time I want to drink, I can watch that video and it will hopefully change my mind. Side effect of making the video was I felt this huge weight off my shoulders, like I was making progress instead of wallowing in my shame and self pity. Now next time I have a little tool for future-me to use the next time I have a craving and want a cold beer.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you to everyone.

I was so confused when she didn’t start nursing. “She sounds so thirsty,” I said to myself. “She needs to eat.” Nothing happened, so I gave up. I stood up and, in the hallway on the way to the nursery, looked down and realized that I was holding…

my dog.

201,PSA: you can stop breastfeeding whenever you want to.,"In case anyone needs to hear it:

If you are at the end of your rope and don’t want to chest/breastfeed anymore, you can stop, you don’t need to continue, you can make a choice that’s good for your baby *and* good for you.

I kept breastfeeding longer than I should have due to all the guilt around stopping to the detriment of my health. My baby and I are both doing amazingly with formula, and 1000 times happier. I could sing the praises of stopping for days. The only thing that made me realise it’s ok to stop is seeing my friend with tears in her eyes saying that she might cheat and give her hungry baby formula so she can sleep for more than an hour. It made me realise I was damaging myself and not being present enough for my baby because of it. I wish I had seen more posts in my mums group about how it’s ok to stop, and less about “don’t give it up too easily”. F that, give it up, it’s fine. 

So this post is for you parents who are struggling with the idea of stopping chest/breastfeeding. It’s ok to stop, you can stop at any point and make the switch that’s right for you. Don’t feel like you need to continue for some loosely defined “benefit” or because some midwife pressures you into it. Feed your baby in a way that works for you. 

If you are enjoying chest/breastfeeding and feel pressured to stop, but don’t really want to. That’s fine too! you should absolutely not feel pressured to stop feeding how you like.",1682106025.0

The Dauntless

&#x200B;

“Right, so ultimately you have to trust your senses. Your digestion is a little more robust than that, but if something smells funny or off then don’t eat or drink it. And if you’re unsure of something only have a few sips or nibbles of it. In an emergency you can eat something fairly foul without too much of a side effect, but making a habit of that will lead to serious health concerns, a large amount of your digestion is now based on the idea of filtering out toxins and poisons. They’ll save you from a lot but they need time to rest and purify themselves for the next round.” Modan explains to Falala as The Officer emerges from the cafe with Theresa86 in tow.

“But the thing I drank was sour and it was good!” Falala protests.

“Yes, sour can be an amazing flavour. In the wild it generally means that what you’re eating is very safe as little else will eating. It’s digestible acid. Usually citric and therefore very clean food. Heck, a lot of cleaning products use citric acid.” Modan explains.

“I drank a cleaning product?!” Falala exclaims in shock.

“No you drank an energy drink. Water is a cleaning product, so is air if used properly, but you have no problem ingesting either of those now do you?” Modan asks in a tone that suggests she’s being very, very silly.

“Hey is that M&M?” Someone calls out and he turns and sees one of the trawlers walking over. All the stupid little cults and conspiracies on the planet were more than ninety nine percent harmless or pointless, but the rare one percent were reason enough to have multiple teams of men just wandering through the city and catching whatever scraps of weird information gets thrown at them. He waves at them and the three men wander over. One of them outright catching a data chip literally thrown at them. Modan has no idea what it is about these men that has people utterly convinced they’re message runners, but whatever it is they have it and Modan doesn’t.

“What’s this?” He asks. Modan is mentally kicking himself as he only recognizes these men from his time in Cruel Space and when he came across them on janitorial duties, begging for more to do. He hadn’t gotten their names then and regretted it now.

“Side effects of the Lakran silliness.” Modan remarks not exactly believing it himself. He still wants people that are closer to experts on the subject actually confirming it. “This young lady now has a nearly human digestive tract and decided that meant human food was on the menu. She started with an energy drink.”

“Caffeine high?” The patrol asks and Modan nods. “Geeze... well at least it wasn’t a sugar high M&M she might have started licking you.”

“... That’s the worst pun on my nickname I’ve heard in a while.” Modan notes dryly and the man shrugs.

“M&M?” Falala asks even as The Officer stops right next to the group.

“Miss... I cannot actually pronounce this name. Miss Urthani, Theresa86 has declined to press charges for the damage to her property and the disruption of her business. I have received no reports of any further damages to property or persons and unless Quartermaster Maji here would like to press charges.”

“No.” Maji states.

“Then you are free to go. Your family has been contacted and will be here shortly. I suggest avoiding flying between the spires at traffic level.” The Officer states. “Now, are there any other considerations or concerns?”

“No officer. Thank you for your time and patience.” Modan says and she nods, gives a long, evaluating, clearly undressing them in her mind look to him and the other men and then heads back to her cruiser.

“Does... does everyone look at you like that?” Falala asks in shock.

“Okay, just how recently did you come out of your cocoon?” The unofficial head of the trawling group asks and Modan can’t help but nod to the question.

“... This week?” She asks.

“In the last seventy two hours perchance?”

“Uhm... What time is it?”

“An hour past midday.”

“Fifty hours ago? Give or take some minutes?”

“And you’ve already been nearly arrested!? Damn! Good job kid! That takes some get up and go!”

“Don’t encourage this!” Modan snaps at him.

“Hey I’m just saying! It takes a lot spunk to get damn near arrested mere days after puberty gives you a solid kick to the can!”

“Do not encourage lawbreaking!” The Officer shouts back even as she gets into her cruiser.

“Shit she can hear us?” One of the Trawlers asks.

“Yes I can hear you! At least wait until the officers have left before you start congratulating people for potentially criminal behaviour!” She calls back to them before slamming the door of the cruiser and finally taking off.

“Well now that she’s gone: Congratulations on your potentially criminal behaviour!” The ‘leader’ of the trawling team exclaims and Modan groans in frustration as he pinches the bridge of his nose and Falala just looks confused.

“Is this a normal human interaction?” Theresa86 asks.

“Oh this is tame.” Modan remarks before suddenly moving and having the leader of the trawler team in a headlock. “Stop being a bad influence you cretin!”

“Oh! Hey! Knock it off!” The man shouts as he flails for a moment before punching Modan in the gut. Modan just stabilizes himself and starts rubbing his knuckles into the other man’s scalp interspersed with a few knocks on the top of his head.

“Stop being a bad influence! Now get back to work you cretin!” Modan says letting the man go and giving him a shove that sends him staggering.

“You know I’m getting you back later right?”

“Looking forward to it! Now get!” Modan orders and with some laughter, and apparently no less than two different organizations mistaking them for couriers, the trawling crew leave.

“Alright then. How about we head inside, we get Falala here something to settle her a bit more and wait for her family? After all, we’ve spent some time in Theresa86’s cafe, it would be rude not to make a purchase.” Modan offers.

“Oh I knew I like, liked you for a reason.” Theresa86 gushes.

“Think he’ll be that good when he’s totally a dad?” Mara asks.

“Like even better.” May replies.

“I don’t get it, why is this so... I mean, why aren’t you angry or trying to press charges or getting upset with me?”

“You’re young and clearly didn’t want to actually hurt anyone?” Jadza asks.

“It’s like totally hard to be angry at a girl you met when she introduced herself face first to your totally reinforced windows?” Theresa86 adds.

“It’s the right thing to do.” Modan finishes up.

“But I... I tried to eat you. I shot my proboscis at you, that’s only for eating!”

“Kiddo, in this galaxy a man just has to be comfortable with the idea of being edible, one way or the other.” Modan says with thinly veiled amusement.

“Wait like what? You have to what?” Falala asks and Modan chuckles.

“Oh, innocent children. Too easy. Far too easy.” He says fondly.

“I’m not a child! I’m fully developed! I left my cocoon and everything!” Falala protests.

“It takes another three more years for an Urthani to fully develop after leaving the cocoon.” Eve replies even as she opens the door to Theresa86’s cafe ahead of them.

“So a teenager then. I was one once, it’s not the end of the world. Theresa86, I think our young friend here needs a sampler platter. Something to test her newly changed pallet. With plenty of water on the side to clear her mouth and hydrate, her new physiology needs a lot of water. Which can make a caffeine rush worse if you’re not properly hydrated.”

“Certainly, and you?”

“Actually make it two sampler platters, a bigger one for me. I don’t know what half the things on the menu are. Jadza? Eve? May? Mara? I’m willing to cover the cost of everything.”

“No that’s not appropriate we should cover it and...” Jadza begins

“I’m the one bringing an extra person in. So I should pay.” Modan replies.

“But, you like totally don’t have to! Like honestly!” Eve says and Modan shakes his head.

“We can totally cover it! It’s like so adorable that you wanna help a young lady like that! Real Paternal instincts!” Mara protests.

“I’m going to leave enough money to pay for all of us on the counter with a tip when we leave. So it can either be for the meal, or it can just be an extra large tip for Theresa86.” Modan cuts off

“But that’s like... why are you totally insisting on this?” May asks.

“Cultural reasons. I’m a provider. It’s baked in.”

“So you’re showing off a womanly side?” Falala asks incredulously and Modan gives her a baffled look before sighing. He doesn’t miss the fact that Theresa86 is struggling not to laugh in amusement. Whoever wins this argument she wins as well.

“These are masculine traits back home.”

“Yes well, you’re like from the place where all light, life and sense goes to die. I totally suppose it like makes sense that you’ll have things backwards.” Eve says.

“Well it’s certainly exotic. A man that wants to keep pace in all aspects? That wants to sweep you up off your feet in stead of the other way around? Have it all instinctual?” Jadza asks before letting out a strange but alluring sound. Like a human impersonating a cat.

“How did you not get that impression already? You’ve seen me spar. All of you have seen me spar.”

“I haven’t.” Falala pipes up.

“Except the kid. You all know that I’m deadly in a fight.”

“I didn’t.” Falala adds and Modan slowly turns to give her an incredulous look even as everyone else shakes with suppressed laughter. He turns back to the rest.

“What I’m saying is that this shouldn’t be a surprise. I’m a trained soldier! A member of an army! With responsibilities and wages and training and duties and squads! I’m perfectly capable of paying, of being responsible and more.”

“But it’s like one thing to be a totally hot male warrior from the savage stars of Cruel Space. There’s been like all kinds of movies about how totally hot that would be. But even the men in those movies are more masculine men and not just women in steaming hot man meat.” Eve explains and then considers. “That was a totally bad way of explaining that. Galactic Trade is like so limited as a language.”

“I get it anyways, the idea of a Cruel Space man is more attractive than an actual Cruel Space man is it?” He asks with a teasing grin.

“NO that’s like, not what I was trying to say and...”

“I still haven’t gotten your orders yet. I can like, get started now if you like. But...” Theresa86 interrupts the bit of confusion as Falala decides it wouldn’t be rude to sit down and ignore the scratch marks on the counter.

They make their orders and the miniature debate as to who should pay gets passed around again. Modan insists he’s going to leave the full payment and tip on the counter and the girls insist that they can pay. Theresa86 encourages all of them and gives Falala a look that promptly makes the girl look away when she suggests no one pay.

“I was just putting the option out. I don’t think anyone’s going to take it.” Falala defends herself as she seems to grow even more comfortable.

By the time the food arrives and just as it’s set down in front of them, another Urthani rushes through the doors.

“Falala (A short chirp in Trill-Speech) Are you alright?” The new Urthani asks as her antenna twitch every which way as she huffs and pants. She seems to shrink into herself as the cafe turns to regard her and then she flutters forward a bit. “Are you alright? Are you hurt? I knew it was a mistake to get you that stuff, the scanner said it was safe but how can anything that was invented by monster from beyond the black be safe.”

“I’m fairly certain I should be offended by that.” Modan notes dryly and the older Urthani lets out a squeak of fright and tries to flutter back with Falala in her arms. But Falala has a grip of the base of the stool with her claws and as the stool is riveted into the floor she’s not going anywhere.

“You! You’re... you’re a human!” The Urthani exclaims.

“Mom. This is... Modan right?”

“That’s right. Modan of the Maji family. Or Modan Maji. I’m a Quartermaster on The Dauntless and a fully sworn in soldier of The Undaunted.”

“You... your poison made my daughter go insane!” The older Urthani accuses him.

“Mom I’m fine!” Falala insists.

“Madam, if you would please calm down. I’m fully willing to explain the situation to the best of my knowledge, although I am rather curious as to where you got the energy drink for your daughter to begin with.”

209,Former A's fan jumping on the Cubs wagon...,"Up until Wednesday night, I was an A's fan for all of my 40+ years.  So many great memories that just can't withstand the shittery that John Fisher has foisted upon us.  I'm sure some fans will blame me for not sticking with my team, and I can take that, but year after of year of dealing with rosters of players that I can barely name while our stars are traded with little value in return is just...disheartening.

So on the bright side, I get to pick a new team (how often does that happen in life?!).  My absolute best baseball experience in my life was in Wrigley's bleachers in 2005...I have good friends in Chicago...and Chicago itself is a great fucking city.

Are you telling me that yet another female protagonist from a AAA Sony game is gay now? Not like I care about Last Of Us or Horizon or any shitty copy paste game that comes out of Sony these days, but I find it extremly funny and hypocritic. Because these morons kept talking about creating role models for little girls, how important for them to see themselves in media, so where are the role models and representation for like 98% of them? Unless they believe all girls are lesbian or bi this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

And believe me, this has less to do with them being woke and more to do with them just simply knowing that majority of people who play these games are fucking dudes. And dudes won't enjoy a romance option with a dude even if the character they play as is a woman. So this isn't ""Hey lesbians, we made a character for you"" this is ""Dudes, you won't feel gay playing this game, you can still hook up with chicks in it"".

New management decided my role wasn’t important… so I quickly got another job, in the interim, working front desk at a small hotel.  I was familiar with FD procedures and the brand, as I had several years experience.  I didn’t plan to stay there long.

This hotel was small - for most of my 3-11pm shift, I was 100% by myself.  Because of that, I had to use my judgment on a number of things.  There was no one to ask, so I would have to manage myself.  Naturally, when you’re alone, you may make mistakes along the way.  That’s how you learn.  I never did anything maliciously.

Well, the FD manager and GM were completely unhinged, and unpredictable.  If they didn’t like a pass on note, or saw something they had a question about, or had a thought in their head *at all*… their first instincts were to 

1) assume you acted in bad faith, and that clearly you’re trying to sabotage the hotel,  

2) Call you incessantly off the clock, and a barrage of texts asking WHY DID YOU DO THAT!!!!

So I used to get text messages in the early morning hours, off the clock, over something that a normal ass person would have waited until I came in at 3pm, to ask about.   Most of it was almost never anything that was ever urgent, or important.  Most of it was extremely trivial.

Because I had my eyes open for a better job… one day, I go to a job interview.  And I get the job.  Right afterwards, I went into my 3pm-11pm shift.  I had a black leather folder that I used all the time, but in this particular instance, I had evidence of the job interview I had earlier that day.

I was an idiot - I left my folder at work.  I didn’t realize it until the next day, when I had

* 5-10 missed calls from the hotel, between 8-9am or so

* Angry texts from the GM.

* More texts from he FD manager, including one saying “Are you leaving us? Why?”  Along with photos of the damning evidence.

Gee - I can’t possibly imagine why one *would* leave such an environment.

It turns out, I left my leather notebook in the back office.  My night auditor saw it, didn’t look inside of it to see it was mine and leave it in my cubby - he assumed it was the GM’s, *and left it on her desk.*

So she came into work the next morning, saw this leather notebook, opened it… and flipped her shit.

Not only that - but, she took it a step further and assumed that I was job searching, using her computer, during my shifts.  Which I would never do.  I may have been a moron for leaving my folder behind, but I’m not *that* much of a moron 

Anyway. These people got the fuck over themselves eventually … or so I thought.  

I gave them three weeks notice.  My last day was before thanksgiving.  These motherfuckers actually tried to schedule me on thanksgiving as my last day- because the other two FD agents started dating, and they wanted to give the lovebirds time to meet each other’s families.

I disputed this, but in hindsight, I wish I had just let it go, and not shown up on thanksgiving.

Edit -  meant to say that I held firm on my last day of work, and didn’t work on thanksgiving.  FD manager scrambled to cover thanksgiving at the last minute - but, what if I just said nothing about it, and didn’t show up?  And those motherfuckers would have had an empty front desk, on Thanksgiving, only to realize “oh shit, we scheduled her outside of her employment.” That woulda been funny, I regret not doing that.",1682107349.0

223,Hubble Spots Super Massive Black Hole Ejection,"This Hubble Space Telescope archival photo captures a curious linear feature that is so unusual it was first dismissed as an imaging artifact from Hubble's cameras. But follow-up spectroscopic observations reveal it is a 200,000-light-year-long chain of young blue stars. A supermassive black hole lies at the tip of the bridge at lower left. The black hole was ejected from the galaxy at upper right. It compressed gas in its wake to leave a long trail of young blue stars. Nothing like this has ever been seen before in the universe. This unusual event happened when the universe was approximately half its current age.

229,Happened a few weeks ago when I gave my step nephew my old Xbox S. But the drama is still going on.,"Now some background. I'm not rich, heck I'm not even middle class, it's just that through very strict budgeting I can pay my bills and buy myself something nice every once in a while

A couple of months ago I ran into deal on a Xbox series x. Always wanted one so I bought it and shelved my series s. My step sister found out I had it and asked about getting it for her son. Honestly these things don't sell for much used and there isn't a big demand so I just gave it to her. This is where the choosing begging comes in.

The day after I give it to her she calls and asks for my login information. She says she doesn't want to buy any games and seeing I can only play one at a time I should allow her son to play the others. I have money so why not help a single mother out. I told her no and suggested the game pass ultimate that comes with about 100 free games. Her reply? Oh well give me that information then. That sounds great. I told her again no and that it was only $15 and she could pick up card anywhere. Her response? Oh when can I expect the card, he really wants to play. I'll go tell him you will get him a card here soon.

Finally I got it through her head that she would just have to break from the bar and getting her nails done and but the card. So now she has been trashing me on Facebook for the past couple of weeks according to kept dad. I don't have Facebook. The sad part is people are agreeing with HER saying it's my responsibility to pay for games and the services because what good is having the system if you can't use it. Some have even suggested suing me for emotional damages to her son.  But hey it's all good, she just posted a picture of her nails she just had done and said if I wasn't so greedy she could have had her hair done too.

Tldr: gave my step nephew a game system. Step sister and strangers think I'm responsible for everything associated with it.",1682105286.0
230,Hospital Nurse thought my parents were crazy.....,"Possibly more crazy than entitled but a happy story none the less....

As a child I was hospitalised numerous times for asthma, more often than not I would end up on the kids ward on the top floor of the hospital after a brief stay in the A&E

And more often than not it would be in the same 6 or 8 hospital bedded room that looked out over the town we lived in.

But one day when I was 4 or 5 (going back to the early 1980s) my attack was so bad I ended up on the respiratory ward in a different part of the hospital.

So no view, no familiar nurses, and no toys since I was stuck in a big plastic tent like structure that covered the whole bed and helped me breath properly.

I wasnt allowed out. I had to stay there for 2 weeks.

I was bored senseless. My parents were only allowed to visit for an hour a day. And whilst I was used to being in hospital, not having anyone to talk was driving me a little “insane"", until a rather nice “astronaut man” in a “rocket ship” took it upon himself to talk to me and read me stories, he disappeared for 3 or 4 hours every day usually around the time my parents visited and so I told them about this “fantastical” - in their eyes- man so they went to the senior ward nurse and kicked up a huge fuss repeating my story, the ward sister/nurse in charge couldnt make sense of the story and thought my parents were a little crazy and told them so.
It was only on the last day on that ward before I was being moved upto the kids ward and “freedom"" that they met the “astronaut man"".

His name was Mike, he had Polio in one of the many outbreaks in the UK in the 1950s before the vaccine was compulsory and spent part of his time in an Iron Lung - his rocket ship, the time he wasnt on the ward was when he went to have physiotherapy, a bath and got some fresh air in the garden by the other ward. It made him laugh till he was red as my folks told him what I had said.

They ended up apologising to the Senior Ward Nurse for calling her crazy, she thought they were crazy. When really it was just me not knowing about stuff and just describing things the way Mike told me….",1682105691.0

237,UPDATE - My Fiancée wants to stay in Florida when HB1421/SB254 becomes law. I’m trans. What should I do?,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/12sxjo2/my\_fianc%C3%A9e\_wants\_to\_stay\_in\_florida\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/12sxjo2/my_fianc%C3%A9e_wants_to_stay_in_florida_when/)

After a day of reading everyone's words and concerns, I spent time thinking what should be best for myself. **Stay in Florida and suffer? Leave Florida hastily without support or a job?** **Give up my only family unit?** These questions roared again and again in my brain, heart and soul. But I know what I need to do.

**I need to leave Florida as soon as I can.** It will not be safe for me here. And I will lose access to my life-affirming care. I know that. I talked to my fiancée about the post I made and about my desires to maintain my happiness and safety. She was open to hearing my truths and the words of everyone from the comments. She supports me leaving and one day, we will be together again in a new home.

But until that day comes, I have to support myself and find my way to leave Florida and find a home in Colorado. I'll start saving what I can from my paychecks - if it's possible. I have to be realistic about my existence here in FL financially before I commit to the move. And when I am stable, I'll buy my ticket to Colorado and ship all of my belongings with me. I'll find my way out - one day.

If you ever might find me in other places on the internet, consider helping your girl out with more support/constructive feedback. I will always treasure what was shared with me here.

Before I end, I want to say thank you everyone for your kind words. I've been in a really dark place due to the onslaught of anti-trans law proposed in the country and in my ""home"" state - Florida. I spend my mornings and nights reading the news for us and I feel sick and unwell from it all. And I've been trying my best to find the right path or answer for myself. I received a lot of feedback and help on what to do for myself. I'm always down for more advice/ways to support myself. Thank you and until next time!

**tldr; I will leave Florida when I am financially able to. I'll find a new home in Colorado where I can have access to my gender-affirming care without worries or my existence as a trans woman not challenged. My fiancée knows all of this and supports me leaving when I am able to.**",1682096403.0

249,"Are you sure it was a book, Peter? Are you sure it wasn't... NOTHING?","This is my experience with a game I'd like to say was severely railroaded, except that railroads actually go somewhere. This was more of a narrative prison, with every single questioning of the circumstances met with, ""I know all about this. I read a book on it.""

Three years back, I decide to try my luck at a pickup game at a local hobby store. The GM is going for some sort of d100 game set 10,000 years ago. They've amazingly already played two sessions when I joined, and I don't, honestly, know how. It's using the CoC rules for a tribal setting, with, as I learned when I got there, ""elements of Eclipse Phase."" Excuse me, what? Whatever. Go with it. It's probably something like sanity rules, right? 

So, I get dropped into this tribal camp having made a shaman-like doctor-sort-of character. The GM doesn't even look at my sheet. This has since become a red flag for me, and I walk right away when it happens. I learn that the other characters and I are all part of the same tribe of early humans, and have basic animal skin clothes and steel knives. That's it. 

And then... nothing happens. Well, the 40-year old weeb keeps aggressing the teenage girl at the table - talking about her breasts, telling her how they'd be exposed, telling her they had to be huge. This is ""ok"" by the GM because ""Neanderthals have large breasts, and they would be distracting. I read a book about Neanderthals, so I know what I'm talking about."" I ask the girl if she's ok with this, and she just kind of shrugs and says, ""Sure. It's fine."" I figure if it were a problem, she wouldn't have come back, right?"" I was much more naïve back then. But, that's only the sidebar to this story. 

There's a lot there. Complicit and encouraged OOC harassment, a defensive claim of knowledge without it being questioned, needless sexualization, and that fact that we're Neanderthals 10,000 years ago.  

""Why aren't we Homo Sapiens if this is 10k years back?""

""Oh, I read a book about it. Most people are wrong. They were actually around 10,000 years back.""

No, no they were not. Maybe as skeletons. 

And more nothing happens. And then more nothing. We get asked what we'd like to do. As an active player, I think of things to do. Players are supposed to come up with ideas, make plans, figure things out, take action and not just sit around. And if they do, the GM is supposed to make things happen for them. You can have passive players, and you can have passive GMs. You can't have both. 

I get told someone is wounded. I'm a medicine man, so I ask if I can help. There's a guy bleeding. No, I'm told. Neanderthals wouldn't know how to treat a wound. No, they wouldn't figure out how to apply pressure even. He read a book, after all. 

I ask why he's wounded. The other players tell me that a nearby tribe of Homo Sapiens raided the camp, injured many of us, and then kidnapped all the women and children and walked off. Immediately I wonder why nobody is doing anything about this, and I ask. I get told that we wouldn't know where they were. 

""I'd like to try tracking them through the woods,"" I ask. 

I know the answer already. ""Neanderthals don't know anything about tracking.""

""Wouldn't they have disturbed the underbrush? Made a trail?"" Stupid me, thinking that a party of 50 people would leave some noticeable trail. ""No, you can't find anything.""

""Then we should probably go searching for them.""

GM says, ""you'd get lost in the woods.""

""Don't we live here?""

""Yes.""

""Then how can we get lost? You said their camp was nearby. We should know, at least in general, where it is. Or, we could look for smoke from their fires. Or, listen for the sounds of screaming captives, or...""

""Neanderthals don't know anything about tracking. I read a book.""

""But we still have *eyes*, don't we?"" I'm not even mentioning about how we shouldn't be Neanderthals at all. 

""Ok, make a roll.""

I didn't even look at the dice, because I knew it didn't matter. I don't think he did either. I'm sure, on a d100, the target number was 1 away from whatever I rolled. 

""You fail.""

""I figured. Hey, do you happen to have that book on you?""

""I left it at home.""

""What's it called?""

""You wouldn't recognize it.""

""But I can still read and understand what *titles* are.""

""I'll send you the name later.""

Uh-huh. I'm sure that's faster than saying it aloud right now. 

I decide, since nothing at all is happening, that I should venture out to find our kidnapped people anyway. I say that I'm going to make spears for us. 

""Neanderthals don't know how to use spears. *It wouldn't even occur to you* to do that.""

**What. The. Fuck.** It wouldn't occur to you. Well, it *did*, didn't it? 

""Why...?""

""Neanderthals had very broad shoulders, I read about it. They couldn't throw spears.""

""Sure... (NO NO NO) but we could still use them for stabbing, right? Just hold them and poke the other guy with one of the most *basic tools in existence*?""

""It wouldn't occur to you.""

""What WOULD occur to us?""

Make a roll. 

""A roll of *what*?""

""Just roll.""

""I got a five."" On a d100. For some nebulous skill. 

""You fail.""

""I fail... what, exactly? *Thinking*?"" Let me guess, it wouldn't occur to Neanderthals to *think*. It's in some book somewhere. Very famous, that book. She lives in Canada. You wouldn't know her. FFS, I'm glad we have this guy who can use this hidden ""book"" technology that's been lost of modern humanity for so long. Like Stargates, those books. 

And this is besides the point that we have steel knives already. We've got metallurgy on our tech tree mastered, but a sharpened stick is alien technology. I also learn, because I suggest taking a torch into the woods to burn out the other camp, that I also can't make a torch. Why? Because we can't make fire. Neanderthals couldn't make fire, did you know that? Never mind that the camp has a camp fire. How did we get it? Evidently, we stole it from some other camp. *How*, you might ask. So did I. But... I failed that check. 

Having had enough of this, and being confined to this camp where no plot at all is happening and nothing at all can be done, I decide to go off and get my character killed. WTH. It's been hours of this crap. What, exactly, are we even waiting for? Godot? The pizza? To exhale? 

I walk off into the woods with my steel knife. I'm told that I hear growling from somewhere in the woods. I recognize this as a hint from the GM that I'm supposed to turn back and return to Camp NothingHappens, so I press on. Now, there's a wolf. One wolf. 

I'm sorry, no. There's a four-legged furry creature I've never seen before with big, sharp fangs. Because, you guess it, Neanderthals *don't know what wolves are*. He read a book on wolves, too, of course. But this not-wolf was special. It hunted alone, and it hunted humans, and it always warned them first by growling. I think I've read this book. It's called, ""The Never-Ending Story,"" because this is a damn Gmork. 

I fight Gmork. I fail whatever fucking roll he asked for - Metallurgy, for all I care - and the Gmork rips out my neck. 

Good. I'm done. I can leave. 

""You wake up back at camp,"" the GM says. 

Oh, my ENTIRE ass. It ripped out my throat! In the woods, where I was alone. 

""How did I get here?""

""You don't know.""

""Did anyone carry me back here?""

""No, they didn't know you were gone.""

Of course. There's only five of us, it must be easy to lose track. Like Grand Central Station, this camp, with the mysterious glowing hot stuff in the middle where we keep our forge, and bleed on stuff, and show off our massive breasts and shoulders, and wait for the plot to get delivered by FedEx but their truck was held up by Gmorks. 

I ask about my injuries. He tells me, ""the others have patched up your neck (with that wonderful 'let it bleed' medical tech, I'm sure) but you've lost your legs. **My legs. Are gone. Because a wolf. Ripped. Out. My. Throat.** 

""How could that even-""

""I read a book in medical school, and this is how-""

**NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE**. Get fucked. I'm out. I'm gone. I'm done. I'm done with whatever this is. 

On my way out, the teenage girl asked me for a ride home. I gave her one, knowing what a damn horror show those guys must have been for her to ask a total stranger for a ride rather than stay there one more minute. And I didn't have to read a book to do it, either.

But how about when the heat goes beyond tolerable outside? When you can't even stay out for 30 seconds without feeling dizzy, why can't suspensions me mandated?

253,AITAH for reporting my neighbours after they blamed my dog for attacking their child?,"(reposting here because on the og AITA it got taken down due to rules) 

My neighbors moved in next to me 3 months ago. We have a high wooden fence seperating our yards. I have a small jack russet terrier who's very friendly and playful. My neighbors don't like the fact that I leave my dog take walks on my yard despite the fact that the dog is never on their side (she physically can't even get on their yard, there's a fence) they just don't like the idea of my dog even approaching the side of the fence because they have allergies and the dog being too close triggers their allergies.

The neighbors also have a 2 year old daughter. Since they moved in whenever they either spot me outside on walks with my dog, alone or even in my own yard they will scold me and try to tell me how I should either rehome my dog or at least keep her in the house at all times or they'll file a complaint. I know technically they can't do anything but still it's frustrating having to deal with that.

3 days ago while the parents were out with their kid, the kid got attacked by a stray dog apparently and was rushed in the hospital with huge bite marks on the face. The kid is in unstable condition right now as far as I know.

The parents decided to blame it on my dog. That my dog attacked the kid. First of all I have cameras on my house 24/7. The day that the attack happened my dog was inside the house most of the day because I was out running errands and I don't leave her on the yard when I'm gone for safety reasons. There's proof of that on my security cameras and the exact time stamps. They didn't know that and they reported me to the police that I'm responsible and my dog's responsible but I told the officers about the footage and I even had aliby that I was out of the house the time of the attack. The police dismisses the parents and I was fine but they tried to frame me and my dog in order to have my dog put down. There was also a couple of neighbors witnesses to the attack by the stray dog.

I couldn't imagine how sick they are for trying to use this tragic situation in order to push an agenda against me and my dog and trying to put my dog to sleep. I sued my neighbors for false accusations and they're being legally dealt with right now.

The reason I feel like an AH is that they are dealing with their child's traumatic experience at this moment and I'm adding to the stress by suing but at the same time I didn't wanna let this go since they tried to twist the story to blame me.",1682094381.0

257,Happy Friday from Benji 🌼,Finally enjoying the warm weather after his first Chicago winter. Can’t believe this bean turns 1 next month 🥹💛🧡,1682089378.0
258,Response to “I’ve been counting for XX weeks but gained a tiny amount of weight” posts,"It seems these posts are becoming more frequent (or perhaps Reddit’s algorithm is just making them appear in my feed more), so I thought I’d try to give some advice from someone who’s been doing this awhile. 

If you’ve been hitting your calorie goals for a couple weeks and haven’t lost weight, the answer is almost always one of two things:

1. You’re not measuring your intake correctly. This means you need a food scale and whatever measuring tools necessary to make sure you are complying with the serving sizes of what you’re eating. You will be shocked at how small a “serving” for a bag of chips is, for example—or how often a serving size says something like “13 pieces (28g)” and when you weigh 13 pieces it’s actually 42g, which would mean you’re eating 150% of the calories that you think you are. You also need to account for condiments/half and half/cooking wine/olive oil/whatever. These things don’t just disappear and are often higher calorie than you’d think. (Seriously, go look how much sugar is in bbq sauce or how many calories are in a tablespoon of olive oil.)

2. You’re overestimating how many calories you burn. It is very difficult to measure calories burned. *You cannot rely on smart watches:* https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2017/05/fitness-trackers-accurately-measure-heart-rate-but-not-calories-burned.html. What has worked for me is using a TDEE calculator set to sedentary and “eating back” *some* of the calories that my garmin says I burned during exercise, usually about half. Also, keep in mind that it’s very hard to out-exercise a bad diet. (It would take a 150-lb person running 6 mph roughly 24 minutes to burn off one snickers bar, for example.) The hard work of weight loss is usually done in the kitchen. 

There is, of course, a chance that you have a medical issue that is making this harder. Until you really try to nail down intake and output (or see a doctor), however, the other redditors in here can’t really help you. 

Final note about weight fluctuations: weight fluctuations of 1-2% are **meaningless.** Going from 160 lbs to 162 lbs does not mean you gained two pounds of fat. It probably just means you had a lot of sodium or carbs yesterday, or your muscles are inflamed from a hard workout, or you just haven’t pooped yet, or, as u/plbbunny noted in the comments, you just had a shitty night’s sleep (or, if you’re a woman, your menstrual cycle is causing a weight fluctuation). 

I understand tracking and not losing weight is frustrating, but you are not immune to the law of thermodynamics: if you eat it, you must burn it, or you will store it. Until you really take seriously measuring input and output, there’s no way to say whether CICO works for you.

261,A new Manager was older than me so knew best way to run an event,"I used to work part time  for my University running student events.  
Experience is the best teacher; I'd participated in these events as a student, assisted in these events under someone else as part of my scholarship and as a staff member ran the events myself.  
We had a new college head who was much older (approx 50-60) while everyone else was in their early 20's . 

This woman was the most pigheaded arrogant fool you can imagine and despite being new she wouldn't sit back and observe how things worked or listen to those on our team who'd been there for years.  
No matter what you told her when she announced something that wouldn't work or would cause problems the answer was the same:  
""I'm older so I know best!"" didn't matter if it would take you longer to do it her way or in one case if it was technically illegal. (Of course mistakes that we'd warned her would happen were always someone else fault/swept under the carpet.)

During event planning, one look at the schedule told me she hadn't allocated the team properly.  
**Email exchange**:

*OP*: ""hmmm probably not a good idea to have the whole team in an hour before the event,most of them standing around doing nothing.   
Best to get 5 or so people in for setup most of the team in for running event and hold back another 3-4 for cleanup""  
*College Head*: ""No I want everyone in helping out equally an hour before the event""  
*OP*: ""They're only meant to do 2 hours work per event if you have them an hour early for a 2 hour event that's 3 hours they'll all leave before cleanup, the slackers will slack off and the proactives will end up doing everything.""  
*College Head*: ""I'm older than you I know best just do as your told""  
**Queue malicious compliance.**

*OP*: ""Fine but I've got some personal business to do directly AFTER the event, I'll handle procurement and setup but will need to leave right afterward the event is over""  
*College Head*: ""Thats fine"" onto other business...  


Day of the event the whole team showed up an hour before for setup, as expected 5 or so did all the setup work while most of the team stood around on their phones, some even got bored and wandered off.  
It was not the team members fault for standing around, only so many people can do meal prep and setup tables without getting in each others way.

  
10 minutes before the event College Head shows up and everything is running smoothly, event was a lot of fun some of the team continued to wander off, some ran the events, some participated.  
I was running around as a gopher letting the College Head take credit for the event in front of everyone (not doing any work mind but taking credit for it).  
I made sure to remind her I had to leave right at the end of the event for ""personal business"" in front of the other colleague heads several times.

To be extra spiteful I neglected to stop several team members from wandering off who'd done no work other than stand around talking/eating and encouraged several people who'd definitely done 2 hours worth of work to call it a night and thanked them for their help.  
Forgetful me I also didn't tell team members standing around during events to start cleaning up as things were finishing.

All the free food was gone, all the games were over both students and team members were wandering off into the night and all of a sudden.

*College Head:* ""Wait where are you going there is so much mess and we've got to put away all the tables and tidy up all the different games but everyone has left.""  
*OP: ""*hmmm yes we probably should have saved up a few team members to do cleanup but they've all already done their 2 hour. Anyway like I told you earlier I've got some personal business to attend to directly after the event so I'll see you tomorrow*""*  
*College Head ""*What personal business is it it?! This will take over an hour to do all this on my own*""*  
*OP* ""I'm sorry but I said personal business because I wasn't comfortable discussing with you or the team about what it was as it really is quite personal and I'm going to be late""  


I wandered off home for my ""personal business"" of closing all my curtains and playing xbox in my underwear, chuckling at the thought of that arrogant woman having to do all that work by herself.  
The formal complaint she put in for me leaving didn't really go anywhere as I just forwarded the email exchange to management.  
Sadly pig headed people are pig headed because they don't learn no matter what, I eventually quit and a few months later was introduced to my replacement's replacement who was also ready to quit.",1682055196.0

As an American currently living in the UK, I gotta say, you guys might have the best bakery/pastry/cakes in the world lmao **Why is everything so good??** I thought the difference in quality between the US and UK was already a big jump, but...this is next level...Paris has great pastries/bakeries as well, but not nearly as much options in bread as Germany....**but I especially LOVE that I can find great pastries at least within every 1-2 blocks.** I am going to miss this a lot now that I am back in the UK. I now understand why my gf is so picky lol *(Still, I'm glad I grew up used to shitty pastry because I enjoy everything now, whereas my gf can only enjoy top level stuff)*

Anyways, love y'all, can't wait to return :)

Anyhow these days I usually spend Friday nights cleaning the house top to bottom so I don’t have to clean it on the weekend and then me and my wife usually just go out on Saturday, recently we been going up to Suffolk to the Tudor style towns etc having a lovely day out, then Sunday I cook us a roast.

271,"Jeff is amazing, but a nerf is imminent.","I played my first match with Jeff a while ago. I was impressed.

Turn 2, Sanctum Sanctorum shows up. ""Cards can't be played here"" - yeah, right. Play Jeff on turn 2 and of course, happy Jeff could go wherever he wants. Take that, Doctor Strange!

Then I started playing with some other possibilities. Opponent dropped a Professor X, and Jeff came to my rescue. It WORKED. Nothing can stop Jeff. Not even a mutant with telepathic powers. Jeff goes wherever he wants.

Pet Mansion? Nah, Jeff is bigger than that. Miniaturized Lab? Kyln? My friends, Jeff DOESN'T CARE.

So far that's all expected and all, but then a few situations surprised me. I had a card on The Space Throne already and I was gonna lose the location to my opponent. You can't play more than one card there, right...? Except yes you can if it's Jeff. I surprised my opponent and stole the location at the last minute.

But it gets weirder. I started noticing I could bypass the 4-card-per-location rule with Jeff. Nothing can stop Jeff, remember?

Not only that, I noticed I could even play Jeff on turn 1. I didn't have enough energy, but Jeff can go anywhere, remember that.

In another match, I didn't draw Jeff on my first turn. But I knew it was on my deck, and to my freaking surprise, as soon as I swiped my finger from the bottom right of my phone, I was dragging Jeff.

FROM MY DECK.

He knows NO limits.

After finishing my daily missions with so many crazy wins, I finally decided to try a different deck to try and climb the ladder. So I picked a discard deck that I like to play from time to time.

And then it happened.

In the middle of the game, I drew Jeff on turn 4. ""Wait a minute"", I thought. ""Did I put this motherlover in my discard deck?"". So I opened my collection and I had a 13th card in ALL my decks.

It was Jeff. He couldn't be stopped. Nothing can stop it from being played or moved. That includes moving into my freaking decks.

I decided it was time to stop playing and go back to work. I locked my phone and, to my surprise, THIS IS WHAT I SAW: [https://i.imgur.com/K0Sa2sl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/K0Sa2sl.jpg).

I didn't know if it was a late April Fool's joke or something, but I wasn't laughing.

Then I hear my SO from the other room. ""Dear, did you install this game on my phone?"". I shivered knowing what awaited me. I'd rather have to explain myself watching porn.

Not even my SO's phone was safe from the inevitability of Jeff's desires. We opened the app and guess what the heck we found: [https://i.imgur.com/2NNjZTn.png](https://i.imgur.com/2NNjZTn.png).

274,My Neighbor Drew Some Weird Chalk Symbols On The Back Of My Door. Now I'm Afraid That Something Terrible Has Happened To Her.,"One Saturday morning when I was two years old, I woke up hungrier than I’d ever been. Down the hall, I could hear my parents snoring off their hangover; they wouldn’t be up until past noon at least. I vaguely remember climbing over my half-collapsed baby gate and waddling down the hallway to the kitchen. I twisted the little black knobs on the stove just like my parents did, but no scrambled eggs appeared. Instead, the stove made a mean hissing noise and the kitchen filled with a nasty smell that I didn’t like at all. The smell kept getting worse and worse, and I had a feeling that I’d get into the worst trouble of my life if my parents found out. I went back to my room to play with my blocks, hoping that the problem would just magically go away. 

Five minutes later, there was a loud knock on the door. My parents grumbled all those four-letter words that they’d told me never to say; then I heard my mother sniffing. She said the house *‘smelled like gas’*–whatever *that* meant. My father staggered out of their bedroom with his jeans and shirt half-on, then yelped when he reached the kitchen. 

Windows and doors flew open; I crept downstairs  to see what was going on. 

“How’d you know?” my father said breathlessly to the shadowy figure on our front doorstep.

“*Know?*” the kindly female voice sounded confused. “Know *what?* I’m Eliza Mortimer from the end of the block. I was just dropping off these cookies that I baked to welcome you to the neighborhood.”

Coincidence or not, Eliza Mortimer had saved all our lives–

And not for the last time.

Two years later came the first of many plate-shattering, furniture-breaking screaming matches between my parents. I was crouched down in the closet with my hands pressed over my ears, but the sharp knock sounded as loud as someone rapping on my own skull. I tiptoed out of hiding and opened the door. 

“Hello, young man. I’m Eliza Mortimer, from the end of the block. I’m in a bit of a pickle, and I could use your help.” The woman on the doorstep was short and stocky, with frizzy brown hair, bright green eyes, and round-frame glasses. She wore an old-fashioned black dress with a wide belt and stood with one hand on her hip; in the other, she held a small red notebook. I’d never seen her before, but for some reason I knew her voice…

“Okay.” I smiled. Behind me, the battle had stopped. I felt my father’s damp hand on my shoulder; he’d been washing the blood off of his knuckles.

“If it isn’t our favorite neighbor,” he sneered. “What can we do for ya?”

“Well, I started a new recipe before I noticed that I was all out of sugar! Could I borrow a few cups?” 

My father sighed and nodded.

*“Sugar,”* he grumbled as I followed him into the broken battlefield of our kitchen. “Who the fuck borrows *sugar* at ten P.M. on a goddamn worknight?”  My father shoved a wrinkled bag of rock-hard sugar into my hand. “Tell her she can keep it.”

“Oh, this ought to be more than enough! Give your parents my thanks, Ethan.” As I waved goodbye, it occurred to me that I had never told our odd neighbor my name. 

Ms. Mortimer came by a lot over the next five years, always with a good excuse: a missing cat, duct tape for her garden hose…once she even wanted help with a crossword puzzle. 

She didn’t always arrive in time to stop my parents from getting violent, but she always showed up before anyone got seriously hurt. I didn’t know *how* she did what she did, but by the time I was seven years old, I loved her for it. I wanted to spend more time with her, but my parents wouldn’t hear of it:

“Nothing good can come of a kid hanging around strangers,” my father said darkly–

Although, as I would soon learn, he had been spending quite a lot of time around *‘strangers’* himself. My mother’s response to discovering his extramarital affair was downing a cocktail of pills with a vodka martini. No matter how much I shook her, she wouldn’t wake, and if Ms. Mortimer hadn’t *‘just happened’* to have been out for a walk when I ran crying into the street, she probably wouldn’t have survived. With my mother in the hospital and my father off with his mistress, it was Ms. Mortimer who took care of me. 

“I wish you could stay here forever,” I told her that night, as I sat in bed sipping her hot soup, “instead of *them.*”

“That would be lovely, dear.” Ms. Mortimer replied. “But I can’t. Perhaps, though, there’s a way that we can keep in touch. Would you like that?” 

Ms. Mortimer walked over to the inside of my bedroom door, bent down, and drew a small chalk circle with a series of odd symbols around it: white marks that looked like letters, but weren’t. She gently pushed the door closed.

“Now,” Ms. Mortimer grinned mischievously, “put your hand inside that circle and open the door at the same time.” I did as I was told.

Instead of the drab hallway I was used to, my bedroom door suddenly opened to a cozy room filled with bookshelves, well-cared-for plants, and an enormous antique desk lit by a single brass lamp.

I tried again several times, always with the same result. Then, when I removed my hand from the circle and opened the door, the hallway was back! 

“That room you saw is my study, in my house at the end of the street.” Ms. Mortimer smiled. “Now, if you ever need anything, or even just to talk, you know where to find me.”

“Bu…how…?” I couldn’t even say it.

“See these symbols around the circle? You must never remove or change them in any way. If one should happen to get smudged, let me know right away–and do *not* use the circle until I fix it, no matter what. Understand?""

I nodded. I *thought* I did.

""Good. Now get some sleep. Your mother and father will be home in the morning, and they'll need all the help you can give them.""

Ms. Mortimer wasn't wrong. Both of my parents eventually came home, but they refused to speak to each other or take care of the house. Dirty dishes and overflowing trash bags piled up like monuments to the disgust they felt for each other. They mostly ignored *me:* I was just another bitter reminder of the lives they *could* have had–

And honestly, that suited me just fine. I stayed out of the house as much as possible: reading in the local library, playing in the cul-de-sac with other neighborhood kids until the streetlights came on…and visiting Ms. Mortimer.

For the next two years, any time I had a question or needed to talk to an adult, I just put my hand in the strange circle and stepped into Ms. Mortimer’s study. She was always ready to feed me something delicious, listen to my childish problems, or even just give me a clean space to draw. 

As far as I was concerned, stretching out on her big Turkish carpet with my sketchpad and a cup of tea was the best feeling in the world. With my trusty crayon in hand, I’d try to recreate the unsettling images that I found in Ms. Mortimer’s old books: women with mouths in the backs of their heads, men transforming into hyaenas, children with a single eye in the middle of their foreheads…

While I talked and sketched, Ms. Mortimer would stir the black cast-iron pot that was always burbling on her hot plate or take notes in her little red notebook. The cozy little room was my home away from home, the one place I felt safe–

Until, suddenly, it wasn’t. 

Just like on most afternoons, I had tossed off my backpack and opened my bedroom door with one hand in Ms. Mortimer’s chalk circle, eager to tell her about my day…but the study was empty. 

The little brass lamp was turned off, the hot plate was cold, and Ms. Mortimer’s favorite teapot lay shattered on the Turkish carpet. Something terrible had happened; I could feel it.

Before I could investigate further, however, I glanced through the open door behind me and saw a sight that frightened me more than any of the monsters in Ms. Mortimer’s old books: my mother was rooting around in my bedroom!

“Where’d you come from?” she slurred, when I appeared suddenly behind the door. “What’re you hiding back there?”

I could smell the booze on her breath from three feet away. My eyes darted to Ms. Mortimer’s circle, betraying me. To my horror, my mother picked up a pair of gym shorts from the floor and began to wipe the chalky symbols away. 

“It’s just not enough that I bust my ass every day to pay for this stupid fucking house, is it? No, you gotta go and *draw* all over it! *Ungrateful,* that’s what you are. Just like your deadbeat father…” 

“Stop!” I shouted–but I couldn’t push past her in time. My path to Ms. Mortimer’s study had been completely wiped away.

“Don’t you *dare* talk back to me, mister! Now *listen:* I ordered us a pizza, and we’re gonna have dinner like a *normal goddamn family* tonight, understand? I’ve had enough of you skulking around up here…” 

As she dragged me by the collar to the kitchen, all I could think about was the gloom in Ms. Mortimer’s study and the broken teapot on its rug. *One way or another, I HAD get back there!* 

After my mother stomped off to bed alone and my father passed out on the couch, I snuck into the oily darkness of the garage and fumbled around until I found a tin can full of sidewalk chalk. I carried up to my bedroom and sat staring at the inside of my door, trying to recall Ms. Mortimer’s odd symbols. There had been one that looked like a tree with no leaves; two that were more like crow’s footprints; a fourth with the appearance of a heart stabbed through with a spear. The final two were the hardest to draw…just *thinking* about them made my head hurt, but ten minutes later I was pretty satisfied with the circle that I’d re-drawn on my door. 

It’s true, it wasn’t perfect–*but I had to try something, didn’t I?* I took a deep breath, put my hand in the circle I’d drawn, and pulled open the door.

I wanted to cheer; I’d done it. There was the study, shrouded in darkness. The little brass lamp and the hot plate were both in place, but the shattered teapot was gone. I wondered if maybe Ms. Mortimer had cleaned it up…that would mean that she was alright, after all! 

I sprang through the door, sure that she’d be proud of me for recreating her circle all by myself…

My breath came out in a cloud of bluish white. It was *cold* in the study…and the floor felt wrong. *Squishy, almost. Like it was made of human skin.* I shuddered and reached out for the drawstring of the little brass lamp. When I turned it on, its bare bulb emitted an eerie greenish-blue glow. 

That wasn’t all that was different, either. 

I could see now that what I’d thought was a pot was actually more like a cauldron: greasy bones and hair floated in a coagulated soup. Instead of Ms. Mortimer’s vibrant collection of plants, stuffed crows and animal skulls lined the bookshelves. Their uncanny glass eyes seemed to follow me as I tiptoed across the weird, squishy floor. I wasn’t sure *why* I was being so careful: *hadn’t I always been a welcome guest in Ms. Mortimer’s house?* 

Most disturbingly of all, there was a breeze in the study: wheezing gusts of air that seemed to blow down from the ceiling. When I looked up, however, all I could see were layers and layers of something ragged hanging from the ceiling–a substance halfway between tattered cloth and spiderwebs. Like everything else in the dim light of the lamp, it had an awful bluish color that reminded me of dead things rotting underwater. I took a deep breath and kept walking forward. 

Up ahead, I saw an angular hallway that led to the rest of the house.

I froze. The hallway hadn’t been there before. I was sure of it. 

*Was I even inside Ms. Mortimer’s study at all?* I’d been so excited to find her that I hadn’t even considered the fact that I might now be somewhere very different…

*Somewhere very, very wrong.* 

I could feel that weird, erratic breeze on the back of my neck, smell it even: a cold reek like meat that had gone bad in the freezer. I spun and looked up for the second time–

And saw its source.

It dragged its distended body toward me through the cobwebby rags with eight spider-like limbs, each capped by a horribly human hand. Its face was a nightmare version of Ms. Mortimer’s: lanky brown hair, pupilless white eyes, a jaw that was opening wide enough to swallow me whole…

*“Run!”* the voice of the *real* Ms. Mortimer boomed in my head. It came out of nowhere, but it snapped me out of my paralysis. As I sprinted across the spongy ground; those awful hands grazed my hair and tangled in my shirt. Fabric ripped as I squirmed free and flung myself back through my bedroom door. I slammed it shut…but heard a hungry pounding from the other side. I hastily wiped away the less-than-perfect circle I’d drawn and scrambled backwards, breathing hard. 

Now I understood why Ms. Mortimer had warned me to never, *ever* alter the symbols around the circle...

But I wasn’t ready to give up. 

I’d just have to find a different way into the house at the end of the street...

I was a technician and applied for an analyst position within the same company/site I was working at. After a week, I get an email from HR with my interview date and time, which was more than a month ahead of time.

I immediatly warn both my supervisor and the person in charge of scheduling that I would need to be available for an hour on that given date for an interview. They both confirmed it was okay and marked it in the schedule as a ""meeting"".

I respond by telling him it's not a meeting, but an interview, and that both he and the scheduler gave me the okay 5 weeks ago. He goes ""Okay, let me see what I can do"" and leaves.

I wanted to have my own ""fireside chat"" with you about some recent behavior during our DJ sets. While this doesn't apply to most people who are enjoying the music, some Earlt DJs have noticed a lot of unacceptable behavior and I want to address it.

For context, the Earlt jam sessions started about two years ago when Wallsh began posting YouTube links in chat while Wubby was running late. Since then, it has grown to a group of DJs using Watch2Gether to listen to music together. This is a labor of love and every Earlt DJ puts in hours of effort in to each playlist, incorporating different genres, memes, and bangers that we know Earlt will enjoy.

Now, to the reason for this message. I have noticed that a not-insignificant number of chatters have become vocally angry with our playlists, and in one egregious case, have even threatened violence against one of our DJs. This is unacceptable. We do this because we love Earlt and want to see it thrive, but these actions are causing some of the DJs to reconsider creating sets. Not every set is going to be for every person, and it costs nothing to simply close the Watch2Gether tab and go touch grass.

Please remember that there is a person behind every username in chat.

308,New EFR shenanigans! Exchange for Related will be the shorts pressure release on the May silver contract.,"&#x200B;

In the hierarchy of privately negotiated trades at comex, the EFR (Exchange for Risk or sometimes called Exchange for Related) is the most ambiguous.  Contracts can be swapped for a ""related instrument"" and the terms of the deal are not disclosed.

These privately negotiated trades always correlate to shenanigans. Some night time reading material:

[https://www.cmegroup.com/clearing/operations-and-deliveries/accepted-trade-types/efp-efr-eoo-trades.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/clearing/operations-and-deliveries/accepted-trade-types/efp-efr-eoo-trades.html)

&#x200B;

I documented the EFR being used to survive the December 22 contract. Its use has grown lately, but it is still fairly rare. This time is is being coordinated with the roll month contract which I've never seen before. It's a little complicated. Hang with me.

Currently, traders are rolling from May to July. The naked shorts would like ALL the May longs to roll because silver in the vault is in short supply.

I'll tee this discussion up with EFR stats before this week:

* Statistically speaking, 97.3% of the time the volume on the spot month EFR and the roll month EFR volume are both zero.
* 2.6% of the time there is an EFR transaction on either the spot month or the roll month.
* 0.068% of the time there is an EFR on both the spot month AND the roll pair.  In my database that has happened 4 times.
* 0.034% of the time there is an EFR on both the spot month AND the roll pair AND they are equal. That has happened 2 times in my data set.

Here is what a cross plot of the EFR of the roll month vs EFR of the spot month looked like before this week. Obviously they don't correlate. They are essentially independent of each other.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at this week's data so far (Friday hasn't posted). The data from April 17 to April 20, looks like this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k63kr4d6oava1.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=65a692768d21b368d3bed012292b3ea9bb50e6b0

I kid you not. Here is today's report:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9pyxqvz9pava1.png?width=1305&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=76bb5569f2f64b29b8cdce55fbdbca5ab57ac0d7

&#x200B;

Apparently, some new techniques are being deployed. I suspect this is a way to incentivize (pay) longs to roll by doing the transaction off exchange as a privately negotiated trade.  Maybe they'd close the May contract with an EFR and then open a July contract through an EFR.

You might be thinking ... c'mon Ditch, 1,750 contracts this week, no biggie.

But that's not true:

* First, don't compare the volume to open interest or trading volume. Most of those folks will roll anyhow. The key is, whether an EFR eliminates someone from standing for delivery. Think of it in terms of the fraction of registered silver (currently 6,118 contracts equivalent).
* Second, the numbers of EFR accumulates!

&#x200B;

The entire EFR trick has been deployed at an increasing rate over the last 6 months (since the vault drain knocked down registered).

The plot below shows the daily EFR volume by contract and the second plot shows the total for each day. EFR hit it's pinnacle during the December contract which was a difficult contract for the cabal.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ojqatc66wava1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cdc4b0bb3b04f632adf045d4ddf9d40b902c856d

See the plot below which shows the cumulative EFR (zeroed at day 44) as a fraction of registered. Some months are nearly zero. Other months have cumulative EFR to be about 1/3 of registered. The December 22 contract (the green line) was a blow out where EFR accounted for more than double registered. This May contract is now at 80%, so it does add up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rn64cocasava1.png?width=3500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0526e88af43deb27b39c314ef9233e757fabd635

These behind the curtain EFR transactions matter and they are being used at an increasing rate. These f'ers are sweating.

&#x200B;

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  The vaults

No follow through of that 3.4 million oz move out of registered at JP Morgan. I was hoping it would just ... slide on OUT OF THE VAULT. But not yet.

319,Using Machine Learning to Find Modern Goalkeepers in Europe,"Last thursday's debacle appeared to be the nail in the coffin for David De Gea. At least from a fan's perspective. The reality is, we will never be able to reach the recent heights that Manchester City and Liverpool have reached, without a playmking goalkeeper.

It is extremely clear that ETH wants us to build from the back more, but this process is impeded by DDG's on the ball abilities. So I decided to use some simple machine learning algorithms to try to seeth through all the goalkeepers in the top 5 leagues, and identify viable, playmaking GK targets.

All data comes from: [https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats](https://fbref.com/en/comps/Big5/keepersadv/players/Big-5-European-Leagues-Stats)

## The Metrics

Before I go into the metrics used, let me clarify something. On all my charts, I want the high value to mean ""good."" However, some values, like ""Avg Length of Pass"" are ""good"" when they're smallest - as this would indicate a GK's tendency to play shorter passes. So I've reversed those values on the charts so that a high value still means good. This is why some variables, (listed below) start with the prefix ""Rev."" Note also that all values on the charts have been standardized (scaled to be between 0 and 1.)

If this is too confusing, just remember this - on the charts, the higher the value looks, the ""better"" it is for that metric for a playmaking GK.

I will evaluate playmaking keepers based on 8 metrics, listed below. All stats per 90.

* **Passes\_Att**: The number of passes attempted, not including GK.
* **Rev\_Goal Kicks\_AvgLen**: The average length of a Goal Kick pass.
* **Rev\_Goal Kicks\_Launch%**: The percentage of Goal Kicks that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).
* **Rev\_Passes\_AvgLen**: The average length of a **Non** Goal Kick pass.
* **Rev\_Passes\_Launch%**: The percentage of **Non** Goal Kicks passes that were launched (passes greater than 40 yards).
* **Sweeper\_AvgDist**: The average distance from goal in all defensive actions.
* **Sweeper\_#OPA**: Defensive actions outside of the penalty area.
* **Crosses\_Stp%**: Percentage of crosses in the penalty area that were successfully stopped by the GK.

## The Problem

## Far from the Elite

So let's see how DDG compares to two of the best playmaking goal keepers, Alisson and Ederson. Note that I'm not doing this to harp on DDG. I just want to show how these metrics really are reflective of playmaking GKs, and establish a foundation for what we need to look out for.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p39rkwsgeava1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ccc96327b284251d5ddd741495ba29d875ee7ff

To the surprise of absolutely no one, Alisson and Ederson far outperform DDG in all metrics. They play more passes per game, shorter passes both from goal kicks and open play, launch a much smaller percentage of both goal kicks and open play passes (suggesting a higher tendency for short passes.) They are also both better sweeper keepers, although Alisson is a much better sweeper keeper than Ederson. But they both have very good command of their penalty box.

## Inability to Build up from Goal Kicks

Now, it feels a little unfair to compare him to two of the best playmaking GKs, so let's compare him to the average keeper across the top 5 leagues.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uguu9tyheava1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21cec7d52938969310acc0117b453fb17fc32e5a

So there are a lot of things that are bad here. Overall, he's basically worst than the average GK in all the top 5 leagues. But there are certain areas that are more important that others. He's slightly above average in open play passes, but when it comes to goal kicks, he's far worst than the rest.

This essentially means that we end up launching most of our goal kicks, which takes away from our inability to play from the back. Notice also how his passes attempted are very low, suggesting that he has very minimal involvement in the build up.

## Takeaway

Okay so, now, hopefully, you will trust that those metrics are indicative of playmaking GK. And understand what we are really missing with DDG. So time for the machine learning to come in.

## Clustering Analysis.

So, we will use a very basic clustering analysis here, called K-means. I'm not going to go in the details of the algorithm or other steps that I took to run it, but at a high level, K-means is an algorithm that finds clusters of goalkeepers with similar abilities.

The goal is that one of those clusters comprises of goalkeepers with good playmaknig attributes, like Alisson and Ederson. And then, we can do a deep dive into goalkeepers within that cluster to find out who we should be targetting.

## Visualizing Clusters

The analysis found 4 clusters in the data, i.e., 4 ""types"" of goal keepers based on their playmaking attributes. One way to visualize it is to use a method called PCA that can essentially reduce all of our 8 attributes into 2, and then visualize the groups by plotting the two newly created attributes:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1yrgy4sjeava1.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ee3abfca4c5d9c6e055f33b29ea33cefa2caaaa8

Each dot in the plot above represents a goalkeeper. The 2 axes are essentially a combination of the 8 variables we started with. So goalkeepers that are close together on both axes, are goalkeepers that share similar playmaking attributes. Here, we can see four groups that our clustering algorithm has identified.

## Describing the Clusters

Now, let's look at the individual goalkeepers within the clusters, and get an average of playmaking stats for each cluster. This will tell us what the clusters really represent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zgo6yq2leava1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4e837e0e63820b10530b5fe5a768d2dd09c64d67

The chart above represents the average metric for each goalkeeper in a given cluster. Let's go through them one at a time

* **Cluster 0**: This is the blue cluster that's barely visible because it is so small. This is essentially a cluster where all goalkeepers are bad playmakers on all front, and bad sweepers.
* **Cluster 1**: The red cluster here is by far and away the best cluster. This is the group of goal keepers with the best playmaking abilities, and also goalkeepers with good sweeping abilities
* **Cluster 2**: Good sweepers, bad playmakers. GKs in this cluster have good sweeping attributes, but are typically really bad playmakers.
* **Cluster 3**: Average playmakers, bad sweepers. This is the one DDG is in, but he's a worst playmaker than most in that group.

## Targets from Optimal Clusters

There is clearly one cluster that is optimal here, Cluster 1. So, I took a look at the GKs in cluster 1 and identified realistic targets. First, I removed any unrealistic GK. As you can imagine, Ederson and Alisson were in this group, so the likes of them are not considered realistic.

I put a filter on age - seeing as we should be rebuilding for the future. I only consider GKs who are 30 years old or younger. Lastly, we also want our GK to be good shot stoppers, so I used the PSxGA metric, which is essentially a number that summarizes a GK ability to stop shots. Positive numbers suggest better luck or an above average ability to stop shots. So I filetered the cluster for only positive values of that metric. Below are the identified targets, including DDG as a reference point:

||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\_/90|Passes\_Launch%|Passes\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\_AvgLen|Crosses\_Stp%|Sweeper\_#OPA|Sweeper\_AvgDist|Passes\_Att|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|27|Ivan Provedel|Lazio|29|0.12|28.8|33|35.4|34.7|4.1|1.51|16.6|29.9|
|46|Brice Samba|Lens|29|0.12|34.3|32.7|26.2|29.3|7.3|1.23|16.7|29.2|
|22|Gregor Kobel|Dortmund|26|0.09|21.7|29.4|42.5|37.8|4.9|1.57|17.3|32.7|
|59|Alex Meret|Napoli|26|0.04|14.9|26.2|20.6|27.1|3.4|1.07|17|22|
|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|

Now, I don't actually know anything about these goalkeepers, I'm just a numbers guy. That being said, they statistically look like better and more modern GKs than DDG. They all have far superior playmaking abilities and sweeping abilities.

## Targets from Sub-Optimal Clusters

We're not done quite yet. There was one more cluster that I described as ""Decent playmakers, bad sweepers."" Now, the cluster overall may be so, but some GKs in there might be on the upper end of the range in given metrics. They may be good playmakers and below average sweepers.

I won't lie, this part of the analysis was a lot of eye balling, but nonetheless, here are 3 other GK who are better open play playmakers than DDG, but not necesasrily better sweepers:

||Player|Squad|Age|Expected\_/90|Passes\_Launch%|Passes\_AvgLen|Goal Kicks\_Launch%|Goal Kicks\_AvgLen|Crosses\_Stp%|Sweeper\_#OPA|Sweeper\_AvgDist|Passes\_Att|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|55|Yehvann Diouf|Reims|24|0.29|29.7|32.3|32.9|33.8|9.3|1.13|12.7|27.3|
|101|Anthony Lopes|Lyon|33|0.08|32.2|32.4|31.1|32.4|5.5|0.58|12.7|24.6|
|84|Michele Di Gregorio|Monza|26|0.05|30.5|32.4|35.3|33.4|3.1|0.72|12.4|32.8|
|75|David de Gea|Manchester Utd|33|\-0.08|31.6|31.6|65.5|48.3|3|0.83|14.5|27.1|

347,"I Watched Morgan's latest video- ""Why I Deleted My Last Video"" so you don't have to.","&#x200B;

\- The video she’s talking about was *“How She Got Her 3 Month Old to sleep through the night.”* She took it down 24 hours later because she didn’t want to make other mothers feel bad/defeated or look to her video in desperation for answers. She does admit that there are better sleep videos out there done by professionals.

\- She’s been feeling really inadequate lately as a mom, wife, daughter, content creator, etc. and it’s been a really rough season, but fortunately that feeling is starting to go away. (Let us remember this is not the first time she’s complained about not feeling adequate with/in her life.)

\- She’s grateful for these depressive, inadequate feelings because that means she needs to rely more on Jesus’s strength. But she is also sad about being in this state because it’s not “fun.” 

\- She claims it’s necessary to go to these negative places many times in one’s life because it teaches about God’s strength, grace, patience and how not to crumble when stuff goes wrong. 

\- On her sleep tip video someone commented on how it must be nice to have such laid back baby that doesn’t require much work and it brought back memories of something she saw on Instagram about 4-6 weeks postpartum. She had an emotional meltdown because Luca was not at the same milestone-even though the babies were at vastly different ages. She does admit that newborn brain and hormones most likely played a huge role. 

\- She admits she’s no expert; she’s just sort of winging it, but doesn’t want to talk too negative about herself as she says she’s done a ton of research about different things. (Sure, Jan. 🙄). 

\-She has been really struggling with YouTube lately, going live, and posting on Instagram, because she feel feels so “dumb” and like she has nothing to give. She’s barely hanging on and needs to ask God for strength for herself, much less find strength to be a YouTube/Social Media “creator” (I use that word loosely, lol). 

\-Before Luca’s birth, she and Paul had talked about her taking a break from YouTube for a couple of months and instead she was back on 2 weeks later. It’s clear that she was not in the right mental or physical headspace for that, BUT that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love YouTube. It’s fun, encouraging, and good for their ministry. She says she’s the one who decided to go back on and Paul didn’t pressure her; she felt she was “fine”. 

\-She’s taking a break from her personal channel and posting less on Instagram to focus on their main channel and being a mother and wife. 

**TLDR: Morgan is going through depression again due to comparison and feeling inadequate (for the 100th time) and keeps trying to “pray the sadness” away, but it seems to keep coming back. Also, surprise, surprise, a baby was not the magical fix she thought it was going to be.** 🙄

\*\*\* She and Luca did get in a slight car accident after the video. Everyone is fine and safe, just shook up.\*\*\*\*",1682109861.0

350,I'm a teacher--can I buy vending machines over the next few years to create a zero-staff low-labor semi-passive income? I just really hate working and would like to do it less.,"I've long given up trying to find a career I find tolerable. I work for the government so I can maybe retire at a younger age than if I didn't work for the government, but I just really detest laboring away my time for income no matter what I'm doing. I prefer a slow pace of living and lots of leisure time alone. I'm thinking if I find enough good locations for vending machines, I may eventually be able to quit work even sooner and maybe just live off the vending machines (or just continue suffering through to retirement, which I'm planning on getting through a government pension at age 52, and use the vending machine money to invest in even more passive sources of income).

351,To the caller that was telling Destiny not to platform right wingers just moments ago on stream,"None of the people that are mad at you in chat are right-wingers or even centrists. 

The people mad at you are the lefties who's side you're theoretically on, but that you represent so god damn terribly. Kinda like how in league, you're never gonna rage at the opposing team as much as you'll rage at your one inting/trolling/afk teammate. 

You are that inting teammate.

You knew nothing about Lauren Southern, Sneako or Nick Fuentes. You didn't have a coherent argument for why Destiny shouldn't platform them, you didn't identify any of their harm or what's wrong with them. You didn't have an internally consistent position relating to what is/isn't in someone's nature and what it means to be predisposed for something. 

You're the embodiment of the stereotype of the young lefty idealist who hasn't thought about his positions at all and who thinks just stating your opinion should make everyone agree with you, and if they don't they're just evil. You have no solutions, you offer nothing of value, and every word you utter empowers right wingers.

353,Please tell me there is a logical explanation for this.. because I’m now scared to go to work,"I (27 F) live in the UK and have been a qualified nurse since 2018, I specialise in Stroke and Stroke Rehabilitation but also work in a private nursing home from time to time to earn some extra money. 

About 6 months ago a new resident moved into the home, we can call her Jenny, for palliative care for her terminal bowel cancer. Whilst with us Jenny found out that not only had her bowl cancer spread to her liver and lungs but she also had brain metastasis and only had a few months left to live. After about 2 months with us she started really freaking out when we would help her back to her room in the evening and get her comfortable for the night. She used to shout at us to “be careful of the children” or “don’t fall in the river”. When asked what she was talking about she explained to us she could see a river flowing through her room and lots of children playing in it, she wasn’t necessarily scared of the children, she just didn’t want us to stand on them and hurt them. The doctors and nurses all believed that she was hallucinating due to the brain metastases and the amount of opioid medication she was on and we all made sure we didn’t stand where she was pointing to so we didn’t stand on the children she could see. A couple of months ago Jenny passed away peacefully and I hadn’t thought about the children or the river since. 

2 weeks ago, a new resident moved into Jenny’s old room, we will call her Sarah. I would like to point out the Sarah didn’t live here when Jenny was here, they have never met and nobody would ever have mentioned Jenny to Sarah. Sarahs first week with us passed and she was settling in well until the other night when we tried to take her back to her room for the night and she refused. She said she was not ever going back into that room because she couldn’t sleep due to all the noise and she didn’t like how “close they all got” we asked her what she meant as the home as very quiet at night and she said “Jenny” I FROZE. I again asked her what she meant and she said “Jenny and the children make so much noise when they’re playing and it keeps me up all night” I was in absolute shock and have had trouble going in that room since. I’ve always been a skeptic but I can’t see any other logical explanation for this, I have asked other staff and NOBODY has mentioned Jenny or “the children in the river” to Sarah. Somebody please tell me there’s another explanation for this!",1682090221.0

The only difference between a ""good"" plant and a clearance plant is they draw a line through the barcode with marker.   This tells the cashier to ring it up at the discounted price. 

Bring your own marker and get half off all the plants/flowers you want. Might want to bring a few colors in case the store only uses a certain one.   Just take a peek at their clearance section and make your line look like theirs.

Babies are here, had to abandon Reddit and basically everything for a while as we transitioned from a family of 2 to 5 overnight! 

I got a lot of push back(polite!) on the name Susan. It was heavily suggested we do Susanna(h) instead.

It just didn’t sit well with us like Susan did. 

So with that said, we welcomed babies August Ellery, Wendy Eloise, and Susan Elodie! 

The E middle names were not exactly planned. We actually tried to fight it but it was soooo hard finding a middle name for the girls! Those were the only ones we truly liked and felt comfortable saying. We felt a little silly giving the girls E names and not August so we looked up E names for him. 

It was a tough choice between Ellis and Ellery. I actually prefer Ellis over Ellery as a first name but again, it just didn’t sit right as his middle name. Had a “lightbulb moment” when we discovered Ellery. 

We kept searching for middle names that weren’t all E’s but none of them fit so we just went with it and I’m so glad we did!",1682080347.0

363,Best advice I can give after 10 years in the industry,"I've read and watched everything about screenwriting I could get my hands on and after working in the industry for a couple of years now, I can tell you what really helped me personally in hindsight.

1. **Scriptnotes 403 - How to write a movie**. Hopefully everyone is already aware of this episode where Craig Mazin talks about how he writes a movie. It is by far the best resource on writing movies I've ever encountered.  
**Biggest takeaway for me:** ""Structure is a symptom of a character’s relationship with a central dramatic argument. Structure isn’t something you write well. It’s something that happens because you wrote well. Structure is not a tool, it is a symptom.What real writers follow are their characters. And what great writers follow are their characters as they evolve around a central dramatic argument that is actually meaningful to other human beings.""  
\[...\] ""Well basically theme is your central dramatic argument. Some of those arguments are interesting. Some of them are a little cliché. And the quality of the argument itself isn’t necessarily related to the quality of the script. For instance, you can have a really good screenplay built around you can’t judge a book by its cover. That’s OK. The theme itself doesn’t have to be mind-altering or, I don’t know, revolutionary. It’s your execution around it that’s going to be interesting.""  
\[...\] ""But the important thing is that the argument has to be an argument. I think sometimes people misunderstand the use of theme in this context and they think a theme for a screenplay could be brotherhood. Well, no. Because there’s nothing to argue about there. There’s no way to answer that question one way or the other. It’s just a vague concept.""  
\[...\] ""But, man and women can’t just be friends, well, that’s an argument. Better to be dead than a slave. Life is beautiful, even in the midst of horrors. If you believe you are great, you will be great. If you love someone set them free. Those are arguments.""  
\[...\] ""Screenplays without arguments feel empty and pointless. You will probably get some version of the following note. What is this about? I mean, I know what it’s about, but what is it about? Why should this movie exist? What is the point of all this?""  
\[...\] ""Now, it’s really important to note you probably don’t want to start with an argument. That’s a weird way to begin a script. Usually we think of an idea. And that’s fine. But when you think of the idea the very next question you should ask is what central dramatic argument would fit really well with this? And ideally you’re going to think ironically.""
2. **Michael Arndt's YouTube-Channel.** [https://www.youtube.com/@michaelarndt8848/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@michaelarndt8848/videos) There are more than a dozen videos on his channel and every single one is worth watching.  
**Biggest takeaway for me:** Beginnings and Endings. He is talking about both a lot and I think the approach he used for his Pixar Journey is one of the most interesting and insightful ones I've come across so far.
3. **Elephant Bucks: An Inside Guide To Writing for TV Sitcoms.** If you are interested in writing sitcoms or comedy in general, this is your book.  
**Biggest takeaway for me:** The backfiring. For me, the thing that seperates the structure of a drama from that of a sitcom or comedy the most, is the backfiring. Usually a sitcom, or comedy character has a plan and it fails because of a personal flaw that character has and then the plan backfires in a hilarious and most importantly: ironic way. And that's where the comedy really shines.

5. **Anatomy of Story by John Truby.** [https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Story-Becoming-Master-Storyteller/dp/0865479933](https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Story-Becoming-Master-Storyteller/dp/0865479933) It covers a lot of the points that most screenwriting books mention as well, but I think this is one of the most thourough and thoughtful approaches.  
**Biggest takeaway for me:** He talks about reveals, reversals and revelations throughout your movie script, which is something that is rarely talked about in depth in other books. The different kinds of twists, the amount of them, how they work and why they can be vitally important for your movie, is really eye opening.

That's it. I think this entails the most important principles about screenwriting you can find. It's not really going to help you if you want to write Lars von Trier or David Lynch films, but other than that, this should give you a very solid craft ground to stand on.

If you have any questions let me know!

And I'd love to know what helped YOU the most in your journey!

Good luck!",1682113446.0

People shouldn’t DIE ☠️ because they overdose on street pills in an attempt to minimize the symptoms of their anxiety, trauma, and depression.

Good, genuine people shouldn’t DIE because BIG PHARMA wants to continue to capitalize off the spread of misinformation and advocation for conventional medications that don’t work for the majority of people, and actually have a large potential to exacerbate the severity of the original problem. 







GOOD PEOPLE ARE DYING. Our brothers, sisters, friends, family, sons, daughters, aunts, uncles, etc. are dropping like flies. Just last week, I received news of another death from an overdose. A young, athletic, bright 21 year old with the world ahead of them. And you’re telling me that all we can do is sit here and watch and mourn? NO! WAKE UP! We can change this. Big Pharma has had its time! Now, as a unified society, let’s give the GOOD PEOPLE of AMERICA 🇺🇸 what they NEED. We NEED to advocate for psychedelic treatments. We NEED to advocate for the legalization and decriminalization of all drugs and psychoactive substances. We need to take this into OUR OWN HANDS. Are you going to sit here and wait? Or are you going to do something about it? Personally, I can’t sit here and watch another friend, family member, or anyone else DIE because they tried years of conventional mental health/psych medications and treatments, didn’t find any relief, left treatment with even more problems, and ultimately overdosed somewhere by themselves because they felt neglected by the mental health system and were SO DESPERATE for an inkling of relief from the mental agony that they endured on a daily basis. 







Are you going to wait for the government to fix this? The same government that created a Valium epidemic in the 1960’s? The same government that created a crack epidemic in the 80’s? The same government that persuaded millions of its own citizens that certain opiates were “non-addictive,” and is now currently in the most severe drug crisis in the history of its nation? Yeah, they’re going to help us.. sure. 






This crisis hits home for all of us, as we’ve all been effected by this in one way or another, and ALL OF US should unify, advocate, and work towards the movement in decriminalizing, legalizing, and properly regulating all psychoactive substances.",1682102204.0

384,"Gloria Martinez, a psychiatric 16-year-old patient, disappeared after she was sedated and left tied to a hospital bed. What happened to her and where did she go?","One of the disappearances that has long been in the memory of many Spaniards is that of Gloria Martínez, a teenager from Alicante who was still a minor when she went missing, precisely 30 years ago in the early hours of 30 October. A heartbreaking family drama and a case that is still open for the Guardia Civil investigators, although the judicial process has been exhausted.

The official version of the case, the only one that has been officially accepted and which has been shelved by the justice system, suggests that the 16-year-old girl ran away from a convalescent home for patients with psychiatric problems in Alfaz del Pi and no one ever saw her again.

But the circumstances of this hasty escape are illogical and have not been credible since the nurses and the management of that medical centre gave their account of what happened to the authorities. If she had been given sedatives to relax her and even had her hands and feet tied to the bed to prevent her from self-harming, and a Bulgarian couple who maintained the facility had been asked to help her, how could she have escaped?

Moreover, the outer wall was two metres high and Gloria had gone out barefoot and without glasses - with eight dioptres of myopia - after midnight and in a wild environment, in the countryside, with no urban centres nearby.

The parents, Álvaro and Isabel, never believed the testimonies of the nurse and an auxiliary, the only people in charge of their daughter's care, nor those of the doctor and director-shareholder of the San Luis Centre, which after her disappearance was converted into a nursing home and subsequently closed for good.

With the added pain for this couple that they had never wanted to take Gloria for this rest therapy, which they only agreed to at the insistence of the psychiatrist who prescribed it, due to the insomnia and anxiety problems she had been suffering from for years. The mother had also asked to stay the first night with her in Alfaz del Pi, but was refused because ""it contravened the rules of the house"", in a high standing establishment, with a swimming pool and sports facilities.

&#x200B;

**CLUES**

Among the unknowns of the case is the discovery in the septic tank of the clinic of an undergarment and a belt in Gloria's bag, years later during a search and inspection of the premises when they were no longer in operation.

In the few hours she was admitted to the clinic, due to stress and fear of being injected with more drugs, the young woman urinated on herself and had wet her underwear, so she moved out. Allegedly at a time when she went to the toilet, she escaped without being restrained, according to the carers in charge of her.

I am going to learn Spanish so that I can communicate with them in that language also. 

I’ve been slowing learning vocabulary. But I don’t really communicate. Yesterday, I went to a local panaderia to purchase some bolillo rolls. I was able to conduct the transaction almost entirely in Spanish. I could have entirely, because I wasn’t asking a lot of questions, but I  got scared a little and used a couple English words.

At any rate, it was simple, nothing major, and not that hard. But it felt good to do.

396,SM and their poor management of Red Velvet’s concert,"After nearly 4 years since their last concert, Red Velvet finally had another concert and a tour, R to V. I, like many reveluvs, were incredibly excited (even though they haven’t announced US tour dates yet 🥲🥲) to see how much they’ve grown as performers and artists.

The first problem that arrived were the venues. For a group of Red Velvet’s caliber, you would expect decently sized stadiums. However a LOT of the venues ended up being super small, like around 5k capacity. One was literally a SINGLE hall in a convention center. It got so bad that reveluvs started trending hashtags demanding better venues.

Then their actual tour started, and even more problems became apparent. The staff only brought 50 pieces of merch to sell, which obviously got sold out in an instant when there’s 5k+ people attending. Because of the small size of the venue, none of the cool stage props at the Seoul concert like the music box were present, so it was just them on stage and the big screen behind them. There were only 6 dancers for the entire concert. No translator was provided for them.

With the way SM was managing their concert, you would think they’re dirt poor. Reveluvs have been complaining about Red Velvet’s mismanagement for a while, but it never seems to get better. You would never expect this kind of stuff to happen to one of the top groups in SM and one of the top girl groups in general. Red Velvet was THE group that got me into Kpop, so to see this is so disappointing, even to the point that I’m not sure if I’d want to go to their concert even if they did come to the U.S. They keep improving every comeback, both with success and artistry, and I wish SM was able to do that justice.",1682088925.0

404,Vinegar's role in cleaning,"Acids (particularly vinegar) have uses in cleaning which are over-looked.  But many people are using vinegar where other things would be far better.

Productive uses of vinegar:

-Pre-soak old pet urine stains (if you have the ability to rinse and extract).  What makes old urine stubborn is the gummy, crystallised, mineral/salt residue which mechanically binds to fibers.  That needs to be chemically loosened and brought into a solution you can rinse and remove.  There might be other color and odor issues which are fixable with other cleaning mechanisms (enzyme, oxidize, etc), but the mineral component might need that acidic soak.

-Similar to urine, embedded sweat stains might benefit from an acidic bath to deal with the salt/mineral component.

-General surface rust and mineral scale of...whatever.

-Rinsing and neutralising alkaline detergent residue from fabrics.  Acidic rinsing serves to make sure that light coloured upholstery and fabrics are not left crusty and prone to yellowing if previously treated with high ph substances.

Vinegar serves no particular use for the following:

-Multi-purpose kitchen wiping.  The kitchen is a grease haven and vinegar just doesn't deal with that 

-Sanitizing.  True, germs don't grow in vinegar but it's not really rated as a disinfectant of other things.

-Mixing vinegar with ""Dawn"" compromises the ability of both.",1682085879.0
405,Love Languages (8),"**Memory transcription subject: Lieutenant Asleth, Arxur Dominion Third Fleet**

Date \[standardized human time\]: October 20, 2136

After a long day of aiding in the rescue of survivors of the bombing in the Canadian city of Royalmount, my new friend Andes allowed me into his abode. It was a large bedroom with a refrigerator and a butchering counter off to one side, in a place called Saint Eustache, one of the many places where survivors from Royalmount were being sent as they were rescued.

""Wanna order something? The UN is paying for everything, they basically own the hotel now,"" he said, landing comfortably on the couch in front of a large screen that had been mounted on the wall. I followed him, gingerly placing my own form upon the soft cushions. I relaxed a little more when the structure did not collapse under my weight.

“What can you order raw?”

“Hmmm… Maybe a couple of chickens? One raw for you, one roasted for me?” he asked, pulling a personal device out of his pocket to do it. “They make them with bones and everything now. Do you want a drink?”

“Whatever you wish shall do, so long as it does not have sugars or fruit inside it,” I said, recalling his ‘protein shakes’ and the multitude of fruits they included.

“Sounds good,” he said, tapping away with his thin, deft little clawless fingers.

“Do your people routinely invite others to their abode to… Converse?”

“Oh yeah. All the time. Talking. Watching TV. Playing video games. Playing board games. Do you want to play something? I don’t have any board games, but I think they actually have controllers here and everything.”

“...I would be delighted,” I said, and he went about rummaging through some decorative boxes near the screen on the wall. He found what he had been looking for. Little plastic machines with buttons and  sticks with flat ends on top that moved.

“Let’s see… This should be fine, right?” he asked, and tossed me one of the ‘controllers’. I caught it, and placed my hands around it. They were a tad larger than the design seemed to imply, but I still found that I could comfortably place my claws on the buttons. He grabbed his own controller, and turned them both on.

He browsed around a library of  “video games”. I quietly envied the luxury of idleness that their variety implied. I knew that there were Arxur, chiefly those from the wealthier families, who could enjoy such idleness. I was not one of them, and to my knowledge, Andes was not particularly wealthy. If he was, his abode would have likely been more adorned.

“Why don’t you pick?” he asked, and gestured to the screen. My eyes scanned the vast range of names and images, until I settled on that of a beautiful little prey animal that looked shockingly realistic.

“That one,” I pointed, and Andes laughed. 

""Really? Not an FPS or something? Okay,"" he said, his voice higher with mirth. He selected the game, and we began with the process of “character creation”. There were a variety of prey animals that we could choose to control. He chose a “flying squirrel”, an Earth animal somewhat reminiscent of a Dossur. excepting the curious flaps it had between its limbs. I chose a “rabbit” that reminded me of a Sikvit.

“What does one do in this game?” I asked eventually.

“I mean, whatever you want. I got all the mods in a sale. I’m going to build a little squirrel tree house,” he said, and set out to gather sticks in his own half of the screen.

I wandered the beautiful meadow our characters had appeared in. Eventually, I found a carrot. I dug up the carrot, and brought it back to a little hole, where I could have my Earth-Sikvit eat it. It was oddly relaxing. I found my worries melting away, as my mind focused on the needs of the computerized “rabbit”.

""What shall you do after  your people have been found?"" I asked. I would usually not be so forthcoming with my curiosity, but the loose focus with which I was engaging made it easier to speak somehow. I began looking for another carrot.

""I don't fucking know,” he said with a little laugh. His voice was so musical. So many of the humans’ voices were so musical. They did not have the squealing quality of prey. “Completing all the rescues will take *months*. I'll probably get dragged into something else before that, now that my skillset is in weirdly high demand.""

""You will not go battle the enemies of Earth?""

""What? No. Fuck that. I'm not a soldier. I'm a lab tech. I was *going* to be a doctor too, but now my university is rubble, so…""

I looked at him in confusion. ""You are not a soldier? Even after this? I heard from one of your fellows that recruitment to fight against the Federation has risen by an order of magnitude.""

""Well of course it has. People want to fuck up alien ass after this. But I don't. I don't want to fight. Some people see the craters and they think '*I have to fight back'*. I think… fighting back failed. You guys are the reason humanity is not all dead. And nobody saw you coming.""

I glanced at his half of the screen. By the time I found my second carrot, he had already assembled a little staircase up a tree, and gone to a river near the meadow to find some rocks.

""Understanding you guys was an order of magnitude more important than flying up there to \[suicide crash\] into some psycho birds or something. And sometimes it feels like I'm the only one who bothered to try.""

He found his rock and took it over to the tree where he’d built the ladder. Then he began harvesting the nearby grass to make rope, to tie the rock against a stick.

“You are not eager to die for your species. You do not care for the glory of battle,” I said. There was perhaps some judgement in my voice, but he was unaffected by it. Instead, he continued to sharpen his primitive little axe.

“I prefer to live for my species, if it’s all the same to you. Or for other species, for that matter.”

I laughed. “How can you say something so noble and yet so cowardly?”

He laughed in return. “It’s a gift, I guess.”

""Do you fear death too much, then?""

""I fear… Fucking things up for someone else. You don't know, eh? You don't know if the guy at the other end of your rifle wanted to cure space \[immunosuppressive retrovirus associated with sexual deviance\]. You don't know if it's fucking… alien Wittgenstein or Hemingway or something. You don't know about their family back home. How they would act, if they had a chance. If they hadn't been brainwashed by their crazy governments. You don't know how it ripples out.""

I could not help but stare at him. Though his form was small and soft, unlike that of many UN soldiers, I had seen his eyes. His determination. How tireless he could be. I had no doubt in my mind that he could become a great soldier if he chose to. He did not fear he would be a bad soldier. He feared he would triumph as one. I could hardly believe it!

""You fear the deaths you would cause *on purpose*?""

He shrugged. “If I said that I’m a pacifist, would you hold it against me?”

I scoffed. A peace-person? The word sounded archaic in my ears. A linguistic remnant from before the Federation had forced our hand. 

“How can you be a pacifist in a time of war?”

“That is the only time you can be a pacifist. Otherwise you’re just a law-abiding citizen. To be a pacifist means to have a reason to engage in violence, to have a reason to fight, and to choose not to regardless. To oppose it in principle.”

“...Ah. It is a kind of asceticism among humans, then?” I asked.

“That’s a good way of putting it.”

There was a little ring outside the door, and he paused his part of the game to go open it. A man delivered two boxes, and Andes took them. He thanked the deliverer, tapped a little rectangle against his machine, and sent him on his way. His voice remained musical, but in a very different fashion that caught my ear.

“Your voice, it sounded different just now,” I said.

“Well, not everyone’s got an implant, we’re in Quebec. I gotta French it up,” he said with a broad gesture of one arm. 

“Only one holder of implants is usually enough.”

“Yeah, but the French output is literally Parisian, it’ll just piss them off. Might as well stick with English at that point.""

I surmised that Parisians were some sort of historical enemy of Canadians. Much like how, despite their prolonged dominance, the Bloc was largely hated by those states of the Dominion that once belonged to the Charter. 

I nodded and returned to my digital quest for carrots. A different creature had begun to steal my rightfully owned root, and I attacked it violently in retaliation. There was a satisfying sound as it let out its last breath.

“Holy Watership Down, croc” Andes said with a feigned wince, and handed me my box of “chicken”. I pressed the centre button to pause and placed the controller aside as he had, so we could both eat. The chicken was delicious. Its flesh fell apart in my mouth like nothing I had ever eaten before. I tried to slow myself down to be able to enjoy it as fully as possible.

“It’s good, right?” he said, eating only one of its ‘legs’ to start with.  The bones were unlike those of any creature I had eaten. They were not the bones of a creature that ran, or flew. They were handles for meat, made of the same material. “*Engineered for maximum flavour*, they say.”

I swallowed a hunk of its flesh whole, and he placed a bottle for my consumption beside my box. It was water, with little bubbles in it. Bizarre, but entertaining to drink. What kind of people had such abundance? Even in a time of crisis, their food could be entertaining.

“I don’t believe you are the only one to seek to understand us,” I said. “But I appreciate the delights you offer.”

“Oh dude, no worries,” he said, and pulled up his device again.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Oh, just… gotta check on my implant at around this time every night. No big deal,” he said, putting the device away. “Say, do Arxur ever *season* things?”

""You guys are totally ignoring the most obvious explanation, is there a reason for that?"" Andes asked, with a bored expression. My throat tightened at his words. First epigenetics. *Now what*? I understood he was busy, but he had taken the time to add Epigenetics onto my proposal; for which I was quite thankful, of course. *How many things had I missed?*

""Would you care to enlighten us, Director Andes?"" said Dr. Marsali.

""It's perfectly possible that male and female children were affected by this behavioural phenomenon at equal rates. We don't have a random sampling of farm children. We have farm *survivors*. And males are a lot more expendable on a farm. So they'd get eaten more often and at younger ages,"" he said, with the casual callousness of a farmer who cares not for the lives or internality of the fruit being harvested.

I managed to keep my composure, for which I was rather proud given the shock and horror of every other herbivore in the room. Dr. Rodriguez looked quite tense. Andes seemed surprised that anyone would be distressed at the notion of young boys being slaughtered for food. He also seemed to be the most capable at that moment. Where all cowered from the truth, he faced it head on.

""What?” he asked, as though surprised at the lack of professionalism in the room. “That's how farming works. Female cattle are used to maximize breeding and genetic diversity. A subset of males are used for breeding, the rest are food. Or waste, in some cases.""

He added a little shrug. Clearly, he expected better of us than horror, and I resolved to deliver. I gave him a stoic nod.

""And y-you know this b-because of y-your… in-intimate r-relations with the A-Arxur?"" Nurse Varla asked.

He was startled by the question. ""What? No? I–""

""--Director Andes has spoken to the children multiple times. It's not difficult to extrapolate,"" Dr. Rodriguez interjected. ""If they are correct, we should see some behavioural anomalies among the male children around five or younger, since that age group more closely approximates sexual parity.""

The others nodded, still clearly struggling to get their bearings back.

""*If* it's somehow genetic,"" Andes added, sowing doubt on my entire project's utility. ""If it was environmentally acquired, we probably won't find anything interesting in that group over the coming years. But whatever it is, we have no reason to think it's associated with sexual dimorphism, on the grounds that our sample is biased in favour of female subjects regardless.""

Dr. Marsali's alarm went off. “Ah. Well, I’m afraid I must be off.”

“I as well,” said Dr. Tavirli, gathering her things. Dr. Slakim did so as well, clearly eager to get out of there. I sighed. Varla hurried after the venlil doctors, glancing at Andes with fear as she left.  The moment they had an excuse, they all fled.

“I’ll… Start getting samples and sequencing them,” I mumbled, and dragged my feet out of that meeting feeling defeated. In the same way that Andes did not think to call me a primitive, he did not hold back in his criticisms in the least. I would have to work harder to impress the human and venlil scientific communities. I would have to resolve to be as he was, impervious to the horrors of the situation.

The initial samples had already been acquired during general physical examinations at the hospital, so I ran through their genomes in the venlil computer programs I had been trained to use. They were absolutely covered in black spots for some reason! I wandered up and down the gene map, hopping from chromosome to chromosome. Most of them had at least one black spot, and some had dozens. I could hardly see what I was doing with such obstructions in my way!

I pulled out the manual for the program, and entered the technical support fora, listing query after query into the investigation box until I discovered what to do. Over an hour of looking at the documentation later, I found a way to display the data without preprocessing. It looked quite standard, then. Just nucleic acids in a sequence. Perhaps it was one of those computer insects humans alluded to? I switched over to a human program that Andes had mentioned during one of our games, and transferred over the ""uncooked"" data. Nothing particularly peculiar happened. How bizarre!

I decided to turn to my board and think through the process externally. Methylation was something I was still beginning to understand, but it would be good to have it on the list if it was standard procedure. The familial clustering had already been done, with most girls in rooms with their sisters, half-sisters, or cousins. I decided that I would first identify the degrees of variation per chromosomal region within my subject population, in order to have a more precise map to work with later on. 

Much like the previous shift, I got lost in the data for hours. I only looked away from the screen when I was startled by the tapping on my door. I opened it to find Andes there, nearly vibrating with excitement. He burst in, closed the door behind him, and took his visor off.

“You will not *believe* what the kid told me,” he said with half-crazed eyes.

“...Go on?” I requested.

“Okay, so. She can write numbers.”

That was shocking in itself! “My goodness. Can she write letters?”

“Well, no. Or at least, she can’t read words. But, she knows what numbers mean, because she *knows what their designations mean*.”

I blinked, a little confused. “Their… Designation? The ones that the Arxur never explained and–”

“Yes. Exactly. So I went–Let me show you,” he said, and pulled up the file on the tablet he’d been holding. Soon, there was a massive spreadsheet on the screen. In one segment were the numbers that we had for the children. In another were different numbers, each with its own cell, with the occasional cell featuring (11) or (10) in the slot of a single digit. In a third section were the proximity clusters we had created, to sort the children.

“Here, I can make your projector show the visualization,” he said, suddenly projecting onto my screen a handful of dots inside spheres with colour gradients that were much harder to make sense of in my mind. I returned to the spreadsheet.

He sorted the children by one of the digits in the modified numbers, and the distinction was stark. Almost all of the ones with the 7s and 11s were sisters, half-sisters, or cousins. It was the tightest cluster in the whole population in the building. He sorted again through a different number, and I could see the difference was minute. The two sets almost entirely overlapped.

“That number means breed. This one means farm. Which means that this farm specialized in this breed, and occasionally sent its venlil to other farms. Our entire population of high-contrast wool venlil with ‘predator disease’ came from one place.”

I nearly fell backwards. This would make everything so much easier!

“And guess who I found in the list of arriving kids,” he continued. “Sixteen more girls. And three boys. All of the same breed.”

“Three boys?” I echoed.

“Mmhmm,” he said in agreement. “And here’s a cool piece for your puzzle. At the hospital, all three were diagnosed with osteochondroma.”

“...Why?” I asked. The bone-growth disease was quite rare in the general population. He shrugged.

“I don’t know. But isn’t it exciting? Now we have a specific physiological phenomenon that is, at least in terms of the actual genes involved, fairly distinct from hair pigmentation, or behavioural changes that could be explained through environmental factors. This is way better than some vague allusions to domestication syndrome.”

*Domestication syndrome*? I would have to ask him about that. I tried to think of what he would say, were he in my position.

“Could not the presence of osteochondroma be explained by environmental factors?” I asked, seeking to emulate the skepticism with which he treated my own thoughts.

“Maybe. If they were exposed to some weird pollutant that Venlil are sensitive to or something, and that affected skeletal development. But I would expect the girls to have that too if it was environmental,” he said, completely unaffected by the doubt. “This might point to new sexual dimorphism induced by selective breeding, whether in the trait or susceptibility to an environmental stressor. Also, in the notes, all of the boys apparently terrified venlil nurses, and are thought to have predator disease for some reason. No notes on misbehaviour, though.”

I ran a hand through the fur on my head, trying to understand. “Why would Venlil doctors diagnose someone with Predator Disease without any behavioural symptoms? What would trouble them so much?”

“I don’t know. Probably some bullshit like having scary teeth or something, I'll have to look at the physiology more closely,” Andes said. “The point is, we’ve *cracked the code* here. I’ve already published it all in the Shared Findings Database. Now all that’s left is to figure out if the structure was sector-wide, or just within some subset farm network, or what.”

Date \[standardized human time\]: December 2, 2136

I worked under Director Karim, along with dozens of nurses, distributing the children around the South Wing of the building. We decided that all of the ones who had been flagged as likely to have Predator Disease would be placed higher up the building, and the more normal a child was, the closer to the bottom their rooms would be.

A few of the boys were bizarrely large. Their bodies had robust muscles much like those of an exterminator with many years in the field. They were not taller than the average adult venlil male, but they were between the ages of eight and twelve, so they towered over their fellow youths. They had black and white spots, an appearance that grew foreboding in the facility, and so I led them up to the top floor. There were still some empty rooms they could occupy there.

Unlike the girls, who were wild and terrifying, the boys were docile and easily led. I got them to their new room without issue, and with a couple of human aides, began to gently brush the fur near the top of their heads to help them see their new homes as comfortable. I was very careful with mine, who leaned gently into my touch with his eyes closed.

As I examined his head I noticed a pointy nub that was otherwise hidden by the wool. I moved the hairs gently around until I could get a good look.

They were horns.

🦋Hi everyone!🦋

We finally crossed the finish line!🥇

I got 6200 diamonds as I should’ve. I bought $49,99 on April 13th and after frustrating arguing with my  bank, Apple and LN I got these freaking diamonds on April 21th.

I still don’t know how it happened but after my last text to LN (“Send me screenshots with you and Apple support. What did they said to you?) at 8:26 AM I got an answer 3 hour later from I guess very reasonable and professional worker who really tried to help. Maybe they saw my post on Reddit😅 who knows anyway I got 6200 diamonds at 6PM and this freaking problem finally over! 🎉🎊🎉

I also noticed that they didn’t answer to my question and didn’t send me screens of their chat with Apple😅

I finally got what I deserved BUT guys this shouldn’t been this HARD! For 9 days I was arguing with everyone going in circles. In my case I spoke with my bank and Apple in Russian and with Love Nikki in English and I had to translate all that to both sides so it was extremely exhausting for me. Especially when no one actually wanted to cooperate.

Even though this issue was resolved and I got what I paid for I still feel like crap. Every time when I would like some recharge suit I will be afraid that this shit can happen again and I don’t wanna go through it again.

After 9 days suddenly I became a “loyal player” and a valuable customer. Great! 

I don’t care whose fault was that either Apple or LN they need to deal with that shit. NO ONE customer should go though this crap! Shame for that on both LN and Apple!

If Love Nikki really didn’t get the money it’s really good that they still delivered reward and probably opened dispute with Apple. But the real truth we won’t know.

Thanks all for following my story and supporting me! I appreciate every single comment guys! U R the best!☺️",1682090333.0

409,Thinking about stepping down as bridesmaid,"Hey all, I’m trying to gather ideas on how to step down/if it’s even a good idea.

2023 has been really rough for me. I went on medical leave for mental health issues and my best friend (who was like family) killed herself. Bride, who is my SIL, asked me to be her bridesmaid before all this happened. I think it may have been tradition that she asked me? We are not close though—nothing in common but I always tried to make conversation with her when we see each other at family gatherings. 

Background info on her: she is mentally unstable. Hard for her to hold a job and maintain relationships. Example: during Christmas her mom asked her to put the dog in the garage when guests are over. She screamed at her face saying fuck you and gave her the middle finger. 

One month after my bff died, she kept telling me to watch a movie called The Menu 3-4x during wedding dinner (we kept it very small). I asked her what the movie is about but she said she can’t give away any spoilers. When hubby and I saw the movie, it showed a graphic suicide that was very triggering. Hubby immediately shut it off. Hubby texted his sister about it.

I didn’t get a text from her so I messaged her and said “hey I know you didn’t do this out of malice but the scene was triggering. I would have appreciated a heads up” 

She went to text him ranting about how we are ganging up on her, making her feel like as asshole, acting like she did it on purpose—and said something really hurtful about me: “she should expect things to be triggering. When our sister died I was triggered but I didn’t expect other people to walk on eggshells” 

She is not technically wrong and I have been triggered by other things but it’s her reaction that was hurtful. I was hoping to have a convo about how hey it’s not something people think about until they experience something like this themselves but she cut that opportunity. I know she didn’t it on purpose but it can be a learning experience for her. If someone else she knows experiences loss, then she will know in the future to be mindful.


She sent me this fake apology later that said “I’m so sorry that you are upset” and shifted blame on her mom.


My husband has told me she has trouble keeping friendships due to lashing out. I’m already going through a lot emotionally and I don’t feel comfortable being a bridesmaid. I was thinking of sending a letter explaining she deserves the best and I’m still grieving.

411,Entitled brother thinks he's immune to the law and won't hesitate to throw my stepdad and everyone else under the bus,"Firstly, I'll need to give you some context:

&#x200B;

Me (19f), my mom and my stepdad live in a rural area, and our house was built at my stepdad's father's land, near my stepdad's brother's house where he lives with his wife and kids. Their parents also live here, so we're three families living on the same land, neighbouring each other. There are multiple other ways in which this arrangement has made life a bit more stressful to me and my mother but that's a story for another day.

&#x200B;

Anyway, the brother's family is significantly wealthier than us. They run a business and own multiple properties, meanwhile my mom is a middle school teacher, my stepdad is a farmer and I work as a receptionist at a public institution. One day though, the brother asked my stepdad for a favor, and that's the very core of this whole mess: to buy a car under my stepdad's name, so he won't pay more taxes because of it. And my stepdad complied, because it was his brother and he trusted him (his words). That was 5 years ago.

&#x200B;

At the time I was enrolling in my last year of middle school, and up until that point I had been studying there with the help of a scholarship, as it was a private school and the tuition was too expensive for us to be able to pay it in full (we do have public schools here but my mother made a point out of giving me the best education she could afford). However, when we applied for that same scholarship that year, it was denied. 

&#x200B;

My stepdad hadn't told my mother about the car arrangement and she only found out when they were gathering the documents needed for the application, and that was exactly what led to it being denied. After all, as the social worker had said ""how can you pay for two cars and not the tuition?"". My mother tried to explain the situation, but was told that ""what mattered was what was on paper"". She got extremely angry, didn't talk to him for weeks, and even thought about filing for divorce. Things only got stable again when my stepdad decided to help paying part of the tuition from his own pocket. But my mom was still sour about it and asked for him to undo the agreement, and for a while she thought he did, and we even forgot about it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2022, I'm already working and in college. Everything was going well, until my stepdad receives a message from a lawyer telling him he was going to lose his driver's license. We were all in shock. My stepdad isn't a bad driver, nor does he tend to drive dangerously or use his phone while on the wheel, but these were all complaints that justified him losing his license. However, as you probably already imagined, it wasn't my stepdad that did all of this. It was his brother and that goddamn car. Apparently the man drives like a drunkard and every time he or his employee got fined while driving the car, it went to my stepdad's register since the thing was in his name.  

&#x200B;

We were also desperate because a huge part of my stepdad's income relies on him delivering the goods he plants, and he would have to pay someone to do that for him if he lost his license. That just couldn't happen. The lawyer said he could try to file a lawsuit to reverse this, but that would cost around 2000 BRL (396,09 USD). He decided to go through with it, however his brother would be the one paying since well, this is all his fault. Surely he'll help his brother out, right? After all, they are family and he's wealthy enough to cover the costs himself, right? Besides, he's mature enough to take responsibility for his mistakes, right????

&#x200B;

Well... the conversation went something like this: Stepdad explains the situation, while brother is nonchalantly on his phone. Then stepdad asks him to pay. Brother looks at him with a scowl and goes: ""What? I'm not paying anything you dumbass! That's just some government bullshit to take money off of r\*tards, go fuck yourself."" 

&#x200B;

Needless to say, they had a very ugly argument after this, and they haven't spoken in months now. The brother's wife was especially upset and offered to pay for everything herself, but my stepdad insists that it has to be his brother (after all, she doesn't have anything to do with it). Currently, the lawsuit is still going and so far they managed to transfer the fines to the brother and his wife's registers (again, she has nothing to do with this and the scumbag won't take responsibility himself).  

&#x200B;

It's just a very sad and messy situation that wouldn't have escalated if this grown man stopped acting like he's an invincible force. The only thing left to do now is to hope the lawsuit works out.",1682098076.0

She claims I can't legally do anything because it's a service animal, but to me this website just looks like another 'emotional support certificate' factory, where anyone can register any dog for almost any reason, with no training.

Dogs with these types of bs certificates aren't protected by the same rules as actual service dogs, right?

418,"I really liked the latest video, but I feel Natalie's conclusion was very US-centric","So her ultimate point about JK Rowling not being the 'final boss' of transphobia, and that TERFS were not the one's with real power, they were more acting as 'useful idiots' for right wing men, does (from what I can see as a British trans woman) apply well to contemporary American politics, but I feel it lacks a lot of context around the way that transphobia functions in the UK. Obviously Natalie is American, so that would make sense, but I do think it's a salient point here, because arguably as 'TERF Island' the political context of the UK is hugely relevant, made even more relevant by the fact that JK Rowling is herself British, as are many other figures identified in the video, including Posie Parker, Helen Joyce and Maya Forstater. Natalie even explicitly talks about 'the Conservative party' being the true 'final boss' as opposed to Rowling/TERFS.

The main problem I have with this framing, is it doesn't really apply in the UK. A significant difference in the US vs the UK is that we are a much more class based society, with a far more insular and concentrated elite, generally known as 'the Establishment'. It's not just related to class it's also geographical - in the US you have cultural/entertainment elite in Hollywood, a media/financial elite in New York, a political elite in DC, a tech elite in Silicon Valley, and then many other wealthy and prominent cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle etc. In the UK cultural, political, media and general economic/financial power all totally concentrated in London. Pretty much all prominent politicians, journalists, celebrities, bankers and indeed the Royal Family are based in London. 

They all go to the same dinner parties, read the same news outlets and are often married to each other. A relevant example - the founder of Mumsnet mentioned in the video is married to one of the most influential television executives in the country. A significant effect of this phenomenon is that 'conservatives' and 'liberals/centre left' within circles of power tend to share many pre-existing ideas around all sorts of issues, including often social issues. If you read Shon Faye's book the Transgender Issue you'll understand this much better, but ultimately the 'Establishment' especially the media have been totally captured by the gender critical viewpoint. 

A couple of months ago, the UK government took the unprecedented step of invoking Section 35, which blocked the Scottish government from reforming trans rights laws. This is causing a significant constitutional crisis, and may be a catalyst for the very dissolution of the UK in the long term. It's no secret JK Rowling's disdain for Nicola Sturgeon, and as she lives in Scotland this has been massively covered by the media - and the TERF movement in Scotland is massive. Similarly in the Labour party, there are currently outspoken TERF MPs openly collaborating with pro-life far right Tories to campaign against trans rights. 

What I'm trying to express perhaps poorly is that in the UK you can't separate reactionary GCs from reactionary conservatives - one supports the other, and they are both as powerful as the other. We don't have a Trump - bigotry here is more subtle and insidious. What we have is powerful TERF MPs, journalists, charity executives, businesspeople, rubbing shoulders at parties and receptions with... socially conservative MPs, journalists, execs etc. You can't unpick the two streams of power nearly as easily. 

If you see the biggest rollback on trans youth's rights to medically transition, that didn't come from a Michael Knowles type political campaign - it was from a prominent detransitioned TERF: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_v_Tavistock

The largest current threat to trans rights as a whole, which would be an unprecedented gutting of human rights in the UK, is from the 'Equality and Human Rights Commission' which has been stuffed with TERFS: https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/ehrc-equality-act-trans-rights-sex-definition-legal-biological/

The most common and familiar example would be liberal/leftist activists calling black conservatives “Uncle Toms”, but more recently, I’ve seen Contrapoints, [in her most recent video](https://youtu.be/EmT0i0xG6zg), do the same thing to JK Rowling, Posie Parker and the cis women in the gender critical movement. 

In the video, to save you nearly 2 hours, she’s ends by calling gender critical feminists and JK Rowling, “handmaidens” of the cis white male patriarchy who are too emotionally jaded by their victimization by men to see trans-women as “actual” women. 

To prove her point, she uses JK Rowling’s horrible experiences with domestic abuse, trauma where it _does_ make sense to be hesitant with biological male, especially if you associate maleness with violence (this is textbook misandry). But then she goes into speculation about Maya Forstater’s relationship with her husband because Maya said on Twitter once that raising children is hard. Contrapoints then implies that Maya’s husband doesn’t pull his own weight in the home for which she has no evidence of except Maya complains about parenthood.

Maybe, it’s almost like parenthood is hard _regardless_ of how amazing your spouse is. 

Not to mention, ContraPoints paints a picture of conservative women guided by some deeply emotional attachment to meaning and betraying their own interest because they don’t like her brand of feminism. Women who don’t agree with her can’t _possibly_ benefit from conservatism in any way so women who are conservative, [which is nearly half of the American population](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/compare/gender-composition/by/state/among/political-ideology/conservative/), are just too emotionally naive and aren’t intelligent enough to see how harmful conservatives are.

In my opinion, calling conservative women handmaidens is not different than calling black conservatives Uncle Toms.",1682095373.0

426,We should welcome any (former) A's fans with open arms.,"I'm a lifelong Giants (and 49ers) fan, born and raised in San Francisco. I've traveled to 49 states and 8 countries all over the world - the BAY is one of the most beautiful and amazing urban areas I've been to. Oakland didn't deserve the way the way the greedy billionaire owners of sports teams treated them. Sure I talked shit once in a while, but it was like talking shit to my little brother...I can do it but if someone outside the family does it they are dead to me. I love Oakland as a city and I know and love many A's fans, all are welcome as Giants fans as far as I'm concerned. 

One of my earliest memories is the A's beating the Giants in the 89 series, as a 3 year old it broke my heart and I cried...but I've gotten over it.",1682085876.0

428,Standards based grading is a huge mistake,"I teach high school English, and like many other 6-12 teachers in America I've been seeing a push from my administration to adopt elementary-style standards based grading. The core message has been that #""grades should only communicate student achievement towards mastery of skills.""#

But by the time students get to high school, the skill gaps can be so vast between two students in the same classroom that the idea of assessing them on the same grade level standards is laughable and enormously demotivating to struggling students. It's one thing to evaluate a 2nd grader as being a few months behind in reading. I've got 10th graders who are reading at a fourth grade level, but I'm supposed to ignore that and assess them on reading texts at a 10th grade level.

I've been told things like ""effort is a behavior, and we can't assess behaviors."" I think that's total bullshit. Effort and attitude are the only things that matter. If there are equity issues buried in that dynamic, such as teachers bringing biased assumptions to what ""effort"" and ""good attitude"" look like from different students, those need to be addressed separately. Babies and bath water. 

To me, the SBG crowd hits all the red flags of naive, dogmatic, ivory tower theory nonsense that falls apart instantly in the real world. They take an idea and instantly make it a commandment. ""Thou shalt not assess behaviors"" started as a reasonable idea not to penalize fourth graders for not cleaning up their glue bottles, but now it means that my 16 year old students bear zero responsibility for treating others with basic human decency or lifting a finger in class? 

If it were up to me, 80% of the grade in my class would be based on a student's diligence and effort toward learning. That's what I want to incentivize. If students felt that their effort would be recognized and rewarded, I guarantee you they would learn more and their skills would improve.",1682091766.0

##**Introduction**

Recently, Reddit has announced that they are making changes to their API which will be in effect on June 19, 2023. The biggest effect this will have will be towards third-party applications (i.e., Apollo, Sync), but the scripts that are used here on \/r/MillionaireMakers also rely on PRAW (the Python Reddit API Wrapper) and by extension, their data APIs, so it’s very possible the changes will affect the way we run.

For the time being, the mod team will pay close attention to the situation. Luckily, this will not affect the next drawings until July’s thread, but expect updates to the scripts that are currently being used in the months to come. Anyway, let’s pick somebody and make them a millionaire, *shall we*?

***
 
##**In Case You Missed It:**
 
* This is done every third Friday of the month, we will be doing this again in May for our 90^th Drawing and the fifth **[Entry Thread]** of 2023! If you would like to be reminded, set a calendar reminder for May 19 at 7 PM ET, join either our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eQPW33F) or [Mailing List](https://send.redditmm.com), or [click here to be reminded through the RemindMe bot via PM!](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers%2Fabout%2Fsticky%5D+RemindMe!+May+19+2023+11%3A00+PM+%22Enter+the+%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers+drawing!%22)

* Our last winner, /u/pangeanpterodactyl, is currently accepting donations! /u/pangeanpterodactyl is an artist and a streamer living in the jolly land of the UK, and is also [cat-tax compliant](https://imgur.com/a/rxtIUNR)! Donations have gone towards Chinese food, treats for her cat, and helping her parents, with the community having raised over £1000! [If you would like to help out, visit and donate here!]( https://reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/11xhszx/winners_thread_88/)

##**Conclusion**
 
Next Sunday at 12 PM ET (16:00 UTC), we will be picking our winner, and you won’t want to miss it. The post will be labeled **[Draw]**, and one comment will be selected out of the many made here to make a winner!
 
Remember, this is about generosity, making an impact, and uniting to make someone's life better. It takes a few minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins. Every cent makes cents, and counts!
 
If a lone $1 or three buys you some chocolate, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000! You can scream “Chocolate” all you want, buy all the chocolate from a local door-to-door seller, and really make their day! 
 
A million dollars can make someone’s candy-filled day! Spread the word: have your friends and family leave a comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share to anyone interested.

She exists in the headspace that she can do whatever she wants without facing any consequences, despite Yohan clearly articulating how he felt and that it’s not okay with him. How she can act so shocked and hurt that he was still upset is insane to me. How does throwing an (albeit very nice) birthday party absolve someone of meeting with their ex? The mental gymnastics Danielle performs to justify her behavior is truly impressive.",1682097148.0

440,"Can we just call it what it is, toxic femininity is destroying our civilization.","All this goings on about politics, trans movements etc etc is just delaying the inevitable outcome. Until we call out toxic women we're only gonna go to the brink of destruction. 

It's well understood that some women get on with extremely asocial behavior when it comes to the spoken word. Study after study has shown while some men can rape murder etc like there is no tomorrow, some women can manipulate us into a nuclear war. 

Men/conservatives keep leading back to the idea that it's rational people pumping up an irrational ideology. It's pathetic that people are even going down that rabbit hole. 

Women have never held more power, our society has never done more to overcompensate and feed the needs of women. None of this is bad on it's own, but it's a novel experiment, we have no idea how this plays out. We have 6,000 years of experience trying to safeguard our civilization against toxic masculine behavior, we've never made any attempt ever to safeguard our civilization against toxic femininity(other than the outright oppression of all women).

Added to the mix of the empowerment of women, is social media. We're in a paradox we've never had more ability to curb the powers of toxic masculinity, and paradoxically have never given so much power to verbal violence. 

We're victims of profound manipulation and it is only gonna get worst as things go along. I get some of you aren't married, or just aren't aware how common and powerful toxic women are. If you're married you see those occasional toxic behaviors, and because you're with someone you trust you look the other way. But when your mother/wife has those toxic behaviors you ironically dismiss it. We're led to believe that women are harmless, which traditionally made sense because oppressed women without freedom of the word are in fact harmless. 

We see the ""good old boys"" argument used again and again to deny absolutely abhorrent behaviors engaged in by some men. It's a tendency to project the moderately anti social behaviors of good men onto to some men that are effectively sociopaths/malignant narcissists rapist and abusers. Society over the century has started to wise up to this idea. Yet ironically the modern ideology of both the left and right is to downplay the power of the spoken word/toxic femininity to do violence. 

Toxic femininity is getting empowered at a rate only comparable to the rise of nazism. The advent of social media has created a differential of power to the verbally manipulative. This dovetails with a state that had overcompensated in pushing the power of toxic women to the extreme. 

We're victims of this manipulation any time we think our problems are anything other than the product of this toxicity. We're a society on both sides of the political spectrum engaging in large dosages of copium. It's far less effort to deflect the problem onto socialism etc, because it's what in front of us. Toxic femininity isn't a left wing thing. We've seen this behavior on the historical right just as often as we've seen it on the left. Toxic women claiming to be raped by ""the blacks"", vilifying the sexual behaviors of men as impure, vilifying other women as being touched by the devil, selecting toxic men/rewarding toxic men by becoming their mates etc etc.   

The point is until people are willing to bite the bullet and call it what it is, we're just going as a civilization circling the drain. It's alarming to realize that since WW2 there's endless of movies/books etc based on curbing the power of toxic men(rightfully so), but there's almost nothing in our cultural narratives (that isn't just outright sexist), focusing on calling out and illustrating the behaviors of toxic women.",1682100152.0

Chapter 35

Subject: Staff Sergeant Power

Species: Human

Description: Mammalian humanoid, no tail. 6'2"" (1.87 m) avg height. 185 lbs (84 kg) avg weight. 170 year life expectancy.

Ship: USSS Liberty

Location: Planet Alpha

&#x200B;

""So what are they calling this system anyways, sarnt?"" PFC Reinhardt asked SGT Gruff.

""Don't think it has a name, right staffsarnt?"" Gruff asked me.

""There wasn't one in the brief. It probably has one of those alphanumerical names, like Alpha Zulu Tree Fower Fife,"" I replied.

A few brief chuckles arose when I said 'fower'. It was one of the oldest jokes in the military, pronouncing the word four the exact way that the military phonetic manual tells you to. It all started with a misprint, legend says, way before we ever even got to space. Someone wrote down the pronunciation of four as 'fo-wer' but put the hyphen in the wrong spot resulting in 'fow-er'.

It stuck like napalm, although you'll rarely get in trouble for actually saying 'four' outside of training. And the only reason you get in trouble during training is because you get in trouble for ANYTHING during training. A fuck-up is just an excuse to make you stronger.

""What about the planet we're landing on? It's gotta have a name if we're taking it over,"" Reinhardt asked me.

""Why do you care? You looking to buy a plot of land to retire on? That's pretty forward thinking there, private,"" I replied.

That wouldn't exactly be a bad idea. Military servicemembers who were involved in seizing land often get a pretty big discount when it gets parceled up, which gives you plenty of cash left over to build stuff on that land. That would only happen if we kept the planet, and that was a pretty big if.

""No staffsarnt,"" Reinhardt answered.

""Not like we're conquering it anyway,"" SGT Int chimed in.

We had all seen the USSS Nidhogg exit warp in Alpha Centauri. Brint had fucked up reciting the cycle of operations of the C21B Service Rifle and as punishment Gruff was making him count destroyers. When he stopped every NCO in the squad looked in his direction to yell at him, but when we saw the dreadnought we found ourselves speechless.

The USSS Nidhogg isn't a secret, but it's not wholly disclosed to the public. A lot of people know that it can destroy planets, and nearly everyone in the military knows that it wouldn't bother targeting a single planet in the first place. It has Mega-MACs that are big enough to turn a continent into a crater, but its primary armament is a beam that can cause a star to go supernova in less than three minutes.

The reason the dreadnought is so large isn't because of its primary weapon, though. It's big because it has several layers of armor and has been overfitted with reactors and shield generators. Three minutes is a long time in combat, and the Nidhogg must be able to complete its mission for it to be an effective deterrence. The entire reason the ship isn't extremely classified is to deter xenocidal warfare against the US or its member species.

There is something that's secret involving the Nidhogg, though. Earlier in my career I had completed MARSOC and been assigned to Intel. During my time there, I was told a lie by my superiors and wanted to prove that they were lying. I think it was probably part of a training program, a test of some sort, but in the process of uncovering the lie I found out about the Dreadnought Reserve.

Dozens, maybe even hundreds, of ships just like the USSS Nidhogg. All sitting in deep-space, completely unmanned and only guarded by a small fleet of VI controlled ships. I was shocked and appalled at this discovery. One ship signals a wish for deterrence. A fleet signals a wish for an excuse.

I learned that this was highly classified information after I had confronted my superiors about it and been arrested. They made me tell them in detail how I came about the information, and thankfully for me I had done so 'legally'. They were forced to cut me loose, but went into excruciating detail on what would happen if I spread knowledge of the Dreadnaught Reserve. They plugged the leak and I went on my merry way.

That had been the end of my time with Intel, as well. They didn't want me poking around any further and I didn't want to accidentally find more galactic secrets. They did pay me for uncovering the leak, though, which was nice of them. 'Shady but not evil' is the unofficial motto of Bureau of United Systems Intelligence.

""You would know that they're calling it OU Planet Alpha if you had payed attention to the verbal brief or read your fucking packet, Reinhardt,"" Gruff spoke up.

""I didn't read the packet either, to be fair,"" Corpsman Yunk provided. ""Don't even know what the mission name is.""

""It's Operation Vainglorious Infiltration,"" Omega said.

""The hell it is.""

""No it's not.""

""The fuck are you talking about?""

""What *possible* drug could an AI take to get that high?""

And a chorus of other negative replies chimed in before I finally stated, ""It's Operation Vanguard.""

""Tsk,"" was Omega's reply.

If I didn't know any better I would say that we hurt its feelings. I looked at Gruff, and he moved his helmet in a slight horseshoe shape that indicated he was rolling his eyes. The shuttle shook, which immediately brought us all back to the reality of the situation.

""Entering atmosphere,"" our pilot said.

""Omega, what can we expect the enemy to have armament-wise when we get groundside?"" I asked.

""Orbital scans showed Infantry, armor, and artillery. They're about as equipped as a standard military,"" it answered.

""What about air?"" asked SGT Int.

""Well they did, but that's no longer a concern. Same with antiaircraft and long range missiles. We have complete air superiority, so feel free to call for air support as needed. If you're good, you might even get some orbital support. You'll have to ask nicely, though.""

I nodded gratefully. Trying to kill a tank without high explosives was a pain in the ass, even as a gen-alt with guardian armor. Omega continued to answer questions as I pulled up the map of our LZ and our objective.

I had briefly glanced at it before we boarded the shuttle, and something about it had bothered me. On closer examination I was able to see why. Omega wanted his box in a spot that was surrounded by hills. It would have been a decent spot if we were a mortar team trying to take out enemy armor, but as infantry it was the worst place we could be.

""Omega,"" I began, ""is there any particular reason you have our objective in this location?""

""The hills will provide cover from enemy armor and it should be easy to kill enemy infantry as they crest the hill. Plus the location is close enough to enemy transmitters to give me an access point to their systems.""

I searched the map for a moment as the rest of the marines looked at each other. Then I added a waypoint to a large hill with plenty of flat land surrounding it.

""Is this location close enough to the transmitters?"" I asked.

""Yes... but why?"" Omega asked.

A chorus of laughter rang through the shuttle as the other marines checked their maps.

""I don't understand,"" Omega said. ""You'll be vulnerable to fire from all directions.""

""When you're on top of a hill, you can use the hill as cover while denying that same cover from the enemy. It's also easier to shoot down than it is to shoot up, mostly due to sunlight and such."" Int said.

""Yeah, that and grenades. Didn't study infantry tactics very much, didja?"" CPL Chang chimed in.

""Tsk.""

Omega probably had studied infantry tactics but like most non-infantry, probably thought that it knew better. Many virtual reality first person shooter players joined the corps and were shocked when they discovered that the tactics in their little games didn't work very well in real life. Age old wisdom dictates that one should ALWAYS take the hill.

I changed our objective marker as the lights within the shuttle turned red and an alarm began blaring. The ride had smoothed out, so most of the newer marines were confused. Those of us who had been on these shuttles in these circumstances before knew better, and weren't very surprised.

""Ma'am? Is this alarm anything to be worried about?"" PFC Rogers asked our pilot.

""It means we're being shot. Our shields are holding up fine, so whatever's doing the shooting isn't rated against aircraft. It's nothing to worry about while you're aboard, but the landing's gonna be pretty hot so you might as well worry about that instead,"" she replied.

""They still got it so you can't turn it off?"" Gruff asked.

""Yup. Apparently we gotta know whenever we get hit.""

We sat quietly and waited for the landing. The only sounds were the occasional shifting of the shuttle and the impact alarm. After a few moments, the fidgeting started. Weapons checks, making sure seals were snug, tapping feet and fingers on whatever surface was available. Standard fare for impatient marines. We didn't have to wait long, though.

""Drop off imminent. I was right, this LZ is hot. Careful out there,"" our pilot said.

""Roger that, ma'am. Alright marines, places. Charlie's on point. Reinhardt and Boyle are carrying the box,"" I ordered.

""Oorah staffsarnt!""

We stood as we felt the shuttle land and the two privates grabbed the box. I chose these two because one of them is right handed and the other is left handed, which lets them keep their weapons outbound in opposing directions.

The hatch opened and we were treated to the sight of the shuttle's shield flaring. It looks similar to an aurora when it's light on light. Just a dull orange wave when it's kinetic, though. CPL Chang took the lead and was followed by Rogers, Higgs, then Int. Their weapons began firing as soon as they cleared the shield.

""Bravo's next. Go go go!"" I shouted

Brint took point for Bravo team followed by the box carriers with SGT Gruff trailing. Their guns also began firing as soon as they cleared the shield, which is a less than great sign of the fight to come.

""Livingstone, you won the tossup for point this time, right?"" I asked.

""Yes staffsarnt!"" Livingstone said with glee.

""Well get going, then.""

I gave the lance corporal a slight shove and followed directly behind him. Private Johns was directly behind me and LCPL Hart was guarding our ass. Livingstone left the shield targeting left, so I targeted right and stepped out, immediately sighting something to shoot at.

Shot, sparks, target falling. Move to defensive position, get some space. Acquire next target. Shot, no sparks, fire again. Shot, sparks, target spazzing. Shot, target falling. I'm hit, only a tenth gone. Not a concern. Shot, miss, shot, sparks. Acquiring. Shot, headshot. Target still mobile, they don't need a head? Shit. Shot, center mass, sparks, target down.

Hit again, taking a knee, scanning, two targets, switch to auto. Die motherfucker die motherfucker die get some, release trigger. Targets down. Scanning sector. One more, switch to semi, shot, target falling. Checking fallen targets, no movement. I kept my eyes on my sector until the rest of the gunfire stopped.

""Clear?"" I asked.

Twelve green lights lit up to indicate an affirmative. I gestured for us to start to move out, and we all stood back up and began to march. The ground beneath us was an unnerving yellow color, and didn't quite feel like dirt. Too crunchy. The sky was a darker than normal blue, which led to some odd optical illusions. Mirages, I suppose.

There were random hills of varying size as well. Some of them were closer to mounds, and off in the distance it looked like there might be some mountains. I wonder if that means there's tectonic activity? I tried to remember my geology lessons to no avail.

As far as plants or animals, there were none. Not a blade of grass or even a small lizard as far as our magnified eyes could see. The only sound was some wind and the crunch of our boots as we marched. As the hill we wanted to be on got into sight I smiled. It was perfect. Around the base of the hill was a vast amount of relatively flat ground, giving us perfect coverage all around the hill.

""Alright, excavation tools out. Help Yunk dig a nice pit on the top for him and the box to hang out in. Then buddy up and dig yourself a hole about three quarter of the way up the hill. I want a nice radius with good spacing. Don't forget your sumps. Make 'em nice and big, we don't know how large their grenades are,"" I ordered as we reached the base of the hill.

""You think they've got grenades, staffsarnt?"" PFC Rogers asked.

""If they've got tanks, they've got grenades. Now get to diggin'.""

Bravo team remained with the box as the rest of us dug the pit. A few random robots came to check on us, but they were quickly taken care of. When the pit was big enough, Bravo team carried the box up the hill and then we all got to work digging our foxholes.

I ended up paired with Lance Corporal Hart. We dug a luxurious hole in the hill that would be our home for who knows how long. I couldn't help but grin knowing what awaited our enemies once we were done. There's nothing more infuriating to an assault team than foxholes on a hill.

Once everyone was done the sound of e-tools being collapsed and stored was quickly followed by the sounds of guardian gauntlets smacking together. Standard procedure for foxholes was to have one on watch and one down for rest. The sound was roshambo {rock, paper, scissors} to decide who took which shift first.

""So hey, uh... staffsarnt. You wanna play roshambo to see who's on watch first?"" LCPL Hart asked me.

""No, no. I trust in your watch-taking capabilities, Lance Corporal. Why don't you show 'em how it's done?"" I said with a grin.

Hart sighed as he turned to look over the landscape and I laughed as I sat down. Rank has its perks, and being squad leader is even better. I double checked my weapon and leaned back. I was nearly ready to take a nap when Omega pinged our comms.

""Everyone is in position. Beginning Operation Vainglorious Infiltration,"" it said.

A series of obligatory negativity and profanity rose from the foxholes in the hill. I just rolled my eyes and closed them, ready for a little nap.

455,Asking what will happen if you let a spell resolve is not letting it resolve,"I was playing a game the other night, and I was in a fairly dominant position.

I was playing a big spellslinger deck, and had a ton of mana available during an opponent's turn which was playing.

So on his turn, he plays a creature spell, that has an eth effect that would deal a ton of damage du to an interaction with another spell.

I didnt know the card, so I asked, what is going to happen, and how much damage he could deal if this all resolves. He counts, and gives me a non lethal amount, so i say i will  let it resolve without doing anything. Then once it resolved, he recounts and the amount of damage changes, and its now lethal damage, and im like, woa, im going to react if its going to kill me.

Then he promptly procedes to say itd too late the spell already resolved, and the other player agreed with him, and that im dead.

Like... I had mana open and a counterspell in hand, of course im not going to let a spell resolve if it single handedly bring me down to 0.

Washing by hand you simply soak, wash, rinse and into the drying rack.

Most of the time you don't even have to put dishes away - you just pick them out of the drying rack to use.

Dishwashers also sometimes smell horrible - but cleaning a sink is easy and simple.

It also uses less water and takes less time.

EDIT: I have come to the conclusion that no one on reddit knows how to wash dishes properly by hand. It's super easy and fast, and doesn't waste water.

EDIT 2: Since people are asking, no, I don't live alone.

EDIT 3: Since I've answered the same question three times now. If you leave clean dishes in the dishwasher, you can no longer use the dishwasher. This is not the case for a drying rack. Ergo - you MUST put your dishes away when you use a dishwasher, otherwise it just becomes an expensive cabinet.",1682074284.0

I'd tell myself I would do projects I meant to do, clean my place, binge video games or whatever. 


About 90% of the time it would amount to me just looking for casual sex and watching porn for an embarrassing amount of time. It would result in me not sleeping, so like clockwork I would get a really bad cold and feel like shit for a week or two, I would miss work consistently due to this, cancel plans with friends, and not be able to enjoy time off or engaging in my hobbies due to the dopamine crash. I knew it was happening but would always give in or convince myself ""oh this time I'll moderate. I'll do better. I'm a better person on these drugs, I can do it "" I knew it was a lie but kept engaging in these behaviors. 

Twice now in the past month the person I've been buying these from has hit me up saying they have X and Y. Twice now I've said in no uncertain terms, no thank you I don't need it anymore. 

It just happened about 30 minutes ago and I just had a moment where I told myself ""Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy your weekend? Even if I don't actually do anything productive, wouldn't it be nice to just relax and when Monday morning comes not be a puddle of anxiety, not have an aching body from lack of sleep, not have a fucked up brain from a multitude of racing thoughts and half-baked ideas. Not deal with being sickly from no rest, and just enjoy life?""

Just writing this because I have no one in my day to day life to share this with.

490,How Draymond Green's absence led to the Warriors flipping the script in Game 3 vs. the Kings,"Golden State took Game 3 vs. Sacramento to close the series gap to 2-1 last night, despite missing arguably their two best defensive players in Draymond Green and Gary Payton II. The Warriors actually had their best defensive rebounding game of the series, which seems odd at first glance when you see they replaced Green in the starting lineup with a guard (Jordan Poole). How did they do this? Easy: by going small.

#**1. The Warriors finally got some offensive rebounds of their own.**

For reference, league-average in the regular season was a 24% offensive rebounding percentage. The Warriors were slightly above this number (24.4%) in the regular season, while the Kings are usually a good defensive rebounding team (77.2% DReb%, good for 7th in the league). In the first two games of the series, the Warriors were at 21.4% and 23.7%, both below their average. But with Draymond out, Golden State upped this to 31% in Game 3, which would've led the entire league in the regular season.

They did this with improved spacing. Draymond is critical to Golden State on both ends of the floor due to his court vision, communication and defensive versatility, but offensively almost all of his value comes from passing and screens. Defenders are forced to play up on him when he has the ball on the perimeter due to the DHO threat in case they need to help onto the next ballhandler, but they can sag off when Draymond doesn't have possession. With Draymond out, however, the Warriors' drive-and-kick game kicks into high gear, as defensive rotations become almost impossible and you end up with multiple shooters open on the perimeter, like [this three from Klay after an offensive rebound](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/120/2c8196b7-c8db-ba16-c58b-13d951e4b1e1_1280x720.mp4). Poole is wide open with four Kings defenders in the paint after scrambling to help on a drive, leading to a free-for-all for the offensive rebound as nobody is on a man to box out. DiVincenzo comes away with the ball and finds Klay open for three as the defense is still scrambling to match up.

In Games 1 and 2, the Warriors collected just 18 offensive rebounds, and no player had more than five total between the first two games. Last night, Looney grabbed *nine* by himself, and three other players collected multiple offensive rebounds, many times off of missed threes where it was a free-for-all inside the paint due to all the spacing.

#**2. Golden State abused the Kings' bigs and forwards on the perimeter.**

Sacramento kept its rotation mostly the same as Games 1 and 2, though the backup bigs -- Lyles and Len -- got fewer minutes. The reason for this was pretty simple: they couldn't stay on the floor if they weren't going to flat-out dominate their matchups on the offensive side of the floor, since they were getting cooked defensively.

Late in the first, the Warriors went with JaMychal Green at center along with Wiggins and three guards. The Kings kept both Len and Lyles in the game, leaving Lyles to defend Wiggins or one of the three guards. The Warriors attacked this, going right at Lyles and Len, [like this play where Lyles got switched onto DiVincenzo](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/169/b72f7ecf-b6c8-5a20-c68f-c686184d8d3b_1280x720.mp4) and bit *hard* on the stepback, leading to an easy driving lane. The same thing happened [with Keegan Murray on this play](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/517/9373db43-a2ad-a966-e4eb-663382aaa44f_1280x720.mp4). With Len, Lyles and Murray all in the game at the same time, the Warriors ran PnRs until they forced switches with those players. This time, they got Murray switched onto Curry, and not only did Curry drive right past Murray, he drew a foul on Len in the process for an And-1. The Kings' forwards and bigs, aside from Barnes, simply could not keep up defensively when matched up with the Warriors guards, leading to foul trouble, easy layups and open drive-and-kick threes.

The Warriors had 15 assists on 17 made field goals in the first half, almost all due to their drive-and-kick game as the Kings simply couldn't rotate quickly enough.

#**3. The Warriors even negated Davion Mitchell's on-ball defense.**

Much was made of Mitchell's resilience in guarding Curry through the first two games. Curry was still getting his numbers (29 points per game on 64% TS% through the first two games) but the threes were much harder to come by, and this also allowed the Kings' help defenders to stay on their guys, putting more pressure on Curry to beat the Kings by himself.

That changed big-time in Game 3.

[Curry got open for a comfortable top-of-the-key three on this play](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/211/1b2a3409-ad8b-1411-760d-7ead71669c95_1280x720.mp4), and all it took was a pretty basic double-screen action. How did that work? Because the Warriors had 6-foot-6 Anthony Lamb and 6-foot-8 Jonathan Kuminga, both 37% 3-point shooters, as their bigs, while the Kings stayed big with both Len and Lyles on the floor. This made the Kings reluctant to switch, since as we saw in the Murray and Lyles clips above, their forwards can't keep up on the perimeter, so Mitchell was forced to fight through multiple screens without much help. That's too much daylight for Curry on the perimeter.

But it wasn't just screens. [Mitchell got lost on a basic backdoor cut here](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/338/1b58bd11-0236-9526-f6a8-7aa57ee69244_1280x720.mp4), clearly anticipating Curry would fill up high after Poole's drive. The lack of rim protection for the Kings was evident all night -- most of the time it didn't lead to easy layups like this one, but a true rim protector would've at least stifled the drive-and-kick game as the Kings' defensive rotations wouldn't have been so dramatic. In this case, even though the Kings had essentially matched the Warriors by also going small with three guards, Barnes at the 4 and Sabonis at the 5, the Warriors' quickness and driving ability led to the easy backdoor.

It also wasn't just Curry who took on Mitchell head-to-head and won. [On this play, with the Kings once again forced to go small to match the Warriors' personnel](https://videos.nba.com/nba/pbp/media/2023/04/20/0042200163/487/da6017bb-3a9b-52b2-fd87-571a1794c203_1280x720.mp4), Mitchell simply gets beat off the bounce after overplaying before the pass. Mitchell just doesn't get over in time, perhaps anticipating a PnR with JaMychal Green after the pass, but DiVincenzo spots the opening and the result is a straight-line drive that leads to an easy 2-on-1 on the backside and a Moody dunk.

---

**In conclusion,** while the Warriors are still a better team with Draymond than without him due to his skill as their connector and defensive leader, his absence forced the Warriors to play more small-ball, which took advantage of the Kings' poor rim protection and slow rotations. Whether or not Draymond can contribute to those mismatches when he returns remains to be seen, but the Warriors found something significant in Game 3 that could potentially flip the series.",1682098882.0

501,I manage 250 single family home rental portfolio. What I’m seeing.,"1. Slower to rent vacant units. They rent, but moving much slower then sale market. We have to drop prices $25-50 after a few weeks on market. Although some units rent within a few days, others take 3-4 weeks. Back when interest rates began to rise, i predicted rental market would boom. Purchasing affordability has been hit hard, so cheaper to rent right? So far I’m wrong, sale market is somehow hotter then rental market.

2. Houses we bought 2012-2021 are cash flow monsters. These buys have much lower loan rates, rent growth has been massive. Very tough to sell these assets with the cash flow being so high.

3. Tenants are staying put. Very little turnover. Too expensive to move? Saving longer for a downpayment to buy own home?

4. Costs are way up! Materials for repairs/turnovers are high. Few years a go doors were $130, now $330. Sure rents have gone up 30% but materials and labor have basically doubled.

5. Tough to find new buys. Numbers don’t work on anything, unless you fudge them and add in future rent growth which if obviously not guaranteed.

In conclusion I don’t think many landlords will be selling anytime soon, or buying much anytime soon either. Rent growth has also slowed way down.",1682080177.0

We need to ban these things. Or at least limit use. Putting them in a truck with a driver who is a repeat offender? Sure. That makes sense. But someone who has no incidents has to be watched? Yeah fuck that.

512,UPDATE: AITA for choosing my sister in law over my brother?,"[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/12lg37a/aita_for_choosing_my_sister_in_law_over_my_brother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)

Firstly i just wanted to answer a common question i keep getting, is my brother still in contact with his kids? No he is not. He has not seen or spoken to them since he was kicked out. His own choice. 

Okay so i have not spoken to my brother since our argument, he refuses to talk to me as well as acknowledge me. My parents still insist that i apologise and make things right with him, i have told them i would try to make things right but i will not be apologising, however my brother does not want to hear anything i say. I have spoken with my parents about everything and how i feel, it was pointless. They don’t even try to understand my side of things, it’s just all about my brother to them. 

Ashley and the kids are doing great. Her family have came down to support her and help out, i also still go over there whenever i can. My parents have not seen the kids or spoken to them either. Ashley has made it clear that they can visit anytime they like but because my brother doesn’t want us to have anything to do with her, they refuse to go over. Ashley plans to gain full custody of the kids to which my brother has agreed upon, this was the only time they have spoken to each other since they split up. 

Ashley is also planning to move closer to her parents which i’m sad about but also happy for her and the kids. They deserve to be happy and away from all this toxicity. 

I don’t know if my brother & i will ever fix our relationship but i honestly don’t care anymore. I’m planning to go no contact with him once he leaves. 

There’s not much more to say. My brother is still behaving like a child and my parents and brothers still stand beside him. 

I will update if anything changes. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and advice.",1682076784.0

519,"NoTraceTrails: We're Hiking 2,650 Miles along the Pacific Crest Trail to Combat Litter and Microplastic pollution - AMA from the Trail!","PROOF: https://i.redd.it/gpyb6vjgg5va1.png

Hey Reddit - Happy Earth Day Eve from the Pacific Crest Trail! Last year, we announced our plans to embark on the largest-ever trail trash survey, and now we're doing it. For the next five months, we’ll be living in the backcountry and hiking the 2,650-mile Pacific Crest Trail to study and document litter along the way. We're already 200 miles in! Our goal is to use the data we collect to create solutions for keeping our natural resources clean and pristine.

Our team is here to answer your questions:

Victoria McGruer, has her Ph.D. in Ecotoxicology studying pollution in the environment and is currently hiking the Pacific Crest Trail and leading the litter survey.

Macy Gustavus, has her M.S. in Watershed Sciences studying microplastic pollution in river systems. She joined our mission after seeing our AMA last year and is now a core team member leading microplastic sampling along the trail.

Win Cowger, a data scientist with a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, focuses on trash research and is currently working at the Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research.

Emin Israfil, the lead developer at Rubbish, is a fellow trash and data enthusiast who will provide tech support to ensure all the litter data is captured throughout the journey.

We invite you all to participate along your local trails. Logging the clean spots is just as important as logging the dirty spots. 

We're excited to share our progress and discoveries with you! Follow our project @notracetrails on Instagram or  www.notracetrails.com.",1682094684.0

I presented to L&D uncontrollably shaking, fever, BP through the roof and the worst headache of my life and they let me lay there. They made racial remarks, told me I didn’t need anything for my headache because black people have a high pain tolerance and I needed to be patient, as if I was there for fun or an induction. They refused to put my daughter on the monitor after a few hours, even after admitting she was “flat” It resulted in my husband carrying me out and taking me to another hospital almost an hour away so I could be actually treated I’ve been seeing a lot of stuff on my feeds.

If my husband hadn’t shown his “ ass” and got me out of there, the doctor said we both would’ve died. I had preeclampsia and an acute infection because my daughter pooped in her sac and it leaked.

My Dad has always been sly when it comes to money.

We already have a strained relationship bc he charged me rent as soon as I turned 18, which was based on his out-of-touch ideal of what the modern economy is.

I literally posted 30 min ago abt how men always hit on me and then get really offended when I reject them cause I'm GAY and somehow that's my issue and I need to get over it. 

So first someone commented saying men have low standards. So I replied saying to not imply that I'm a low standard, you don't know me and I'm very attractive in a girl next door way. The then called me narcissistic. It's not, it's confidence. Then when I said it's confidence they said that I put all my value in my worth and am insecure and narcissistic... what? I'm allowed to be confident with how I look. I definitely did grow up putting too much pressure on my looks cause I was raised by two abusers, my mom told me how I'm the pretty sibling and I need to be careful cause I'll be raped all the time. My father grooming me and telling me he's picking me cause I'm pretty (to sexually abuse) Yes this sucked, but this makes it easier for me to be confident with my looks ofc. Like how could it not. But with lots of therapy I have realized that just cause of what my parents told me doesn't mean that I'm stupid (with grades never below an 80, but that wasn't good enough cause my sister got 85s+) or that my only asset is my looks. But somehow I'm narcissistic guys. 

Then someone told me to just let the behaviour go, like women don't have to be attracted to the guy, but then guys don't have to be friends with the girls. Sure, but then they can't get put out when a girl KINDLY rejects them because she is GAY!!! and they said to let it go. 

Like I just cant with men. I wanna cry rn tbh. I have had a rly tough week and I just can't.

543,Trying to make a non-issue my issue? Enjoy being scolded like a child.,"This just happened, needed a vent, wrote on phone so sorry for grammar/typos.


Major context: I work in cleanroom production with biologics, so our activities are monitored through bacteria growth to see how sterile we work. This means after shifts we have to sample areas with agar plates, either through contact or not, and see what does or (hopefully) doesn't grow.

One technique is to use a machine that sucks air into an open plate, so in theory it takes into account all the microbes in the air of the room. This is called active air and takes 10 minutes. Aside from area sampling, persons are sampled as well.

Every sample point needs to be as exact as possible to the room map, as per procedure, and in this particular shift me and my team were watched by QC, so no slacking.


Story: I worked with this lady we'll call Mary. We were rushing to end the aseptic work, and as I was sampling her she placed aside some plates for my sampling. But another set has been marked by another person who is our support, so I didn't use the set she saved for me, which were unmarked.

Apparently this struck a cord in her.

Queue a few minutes later, the plates were being properly labelled (again, per procedure). QC person saw the unmarked set of plates and asked whose samples those belong to. Sometimes in process, places or people are sampled but the plates wouldn't be marked yet, this would be done later and then labelled, QC was cautious about this. I said that it wasn't used.

Mary though, had a bone to pick, and decided to butt in and say ""Those are the samples I _nicely_ set aside for OP that they didn't take"". She said that with a pointed glare to me, as if I did the greatest of slights on using marked plates rather than unmarked ones. QC got confused and started panicking about me, as he thought I hadn't been sampled. So I had to raise my voice, a voice that is tired and hoarse for the straight 2 hours I had to use constantly, to say what happened.

But fuck this bitch.

Then I noticed she was setting up the active air on the wrong sampling point. Another thing about this device is that when it's turned on, you can't stop it. So the only viable way to resample is to let it run its course before retaking the sample.

I said jack shit about it. QC noticed seconds too late.

He sternly scolded her for this, and if there's anything I know about Mary, is that she doesn't take well to people correcting her. Even during the resampling, he was watching her like a hawk and had to correct her again when she didn't position it _exactly_ like it is in the map.

She looked and sounded flustered, especially since she was delegated to sampling the entire room. I spent the time sitting back, relaxing my aching feet, and being as unhelpfully aseptic as possible.

556,French Connection Finance $FCF - Cobranding deal just announced between Babydoge and FCF! | Official virtual and physical crypto cards to 5 CEX | Cobrand deal announced with Floki!| FCF Mobile App announced!," 

$FCF token launched in August 2021 with a mission to build a project like no other, one that generates revenue from real world economic activity, working in harmony with the community for maximum reach and market penetration.

Q4 2021 saw $FCF Revenue Sharing Token rocket from $20k market cap at launch to over $75m. This was before any products had been launched.

FCF Pay - the project’s Blockchain Payment System - went live in February 2022 following significant investment from the project’s founder John Nasr to fund the intensive development necessary to create the system completely from scratch.

Shortly after, more team members were also publicly doxxed, including Joe Parkin (COO) and Adrian Dragan (CTO), both of whom attended the Dubai Crypto Expo in March 2022, where FCF was awarded “Most Innovative Project 2022”.

The rest of 2022 was incredibly busy for the team, launching e-commerce plugins, closing deals with customers, announcing partnerships, extending the functionalities of FCF Pay and so on.

In Q4 things got REALLY exciting, with 1 HUGE feature roll-out in the form of the system’s white label capability (which allows partners to use the system under their own brand), and the launch of the FCF Pay debit card programs; virtual and physical debit cards, also available as a white label product.

Since then, the volume of payments through the system has increased dramatically and the good news just keeps on coming!

Co-branded collaborations have already been revealed with Floki and Sharbi. Sharbi token are offering FCF Pay prepaid Visa/Mastercard gift cards directly in their rewards app. The exact details of the Floki collaboration are yet to be revealed, but are expected in the near future.

Meanwhile, the FCF team have confirmed that they have already signed 5 contracts to provide physical and virtual prepaid crypto cards to exchanges and crypto projects. Thousands of cards have already been shipped and one of their customers is preparing to order as many as 200k cards for their customers following an initial trial period.

White label deals are also underway for traditional fiat payments companies to use FCF Pay white label in order to allow customers to pay for all sorts of goods and services directly with cryptocurrencies.

Part of every transaction through FCF systems is used to reward $FCF Revenue Sharing Token holders for the invaluable part that they play promoting the ecosystem. Buyback and burns, as well as reward distribution in $BNB are now happening on a daily basis and are substantial enough to be noticeable on the chart. This is on top of rewards from tokenomics on token trading volume. Community morale is very high and the team can work efficiently thanks to the amazing level of support and positivity.

This revolutionary business model, symbiotically collaborating with the community for the collective benefit of the business and the holders, as well as the technical and business expertise of the team, make this project one that should definitely keep an eye on.

The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that's inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.

Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server's A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.

It's Friday, I've had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! 

Just wanted to share this little victory. Have a good weekend guys.",1682112475.0
562,whats the deal w fat bitches nowadays,"
why tf is it considered okay to literally be obese and not change a thing about it????

chicks specially man, it's always the big chunky ones going off about shit and running their fat mouth about how amazing they are. most people have flaws that come out as you get to know them but holy shit you are a walking flaw. I literally get the ick from fat women that continue to make it worse for themselves with their diet, lifestyle etc. 

like these chicks could be rich, sugar momma me around and I would never find her attractive. might be the fact that getting into taking care of myself and realizing how far of a way it goes makes me feel this way but yeah holy shit so done w these gigantic women running their fat mouth all day. 

Also, don't get me wrong. I find women equally attractive that may have let themselves go but work hard to change that. It is commendable but this just the way I feel about generic fat bitches that glorify obesity",1682086474.0

565,"Microsoft Isn’t Happy With The State of Xbox, Jeff Grubb Says","According to journalist Jeff Grubb, Microsoft isn't happy with the state of the Xbox division. In a new episode of Grubb's Game Mess, he talked with GamesBeat managing editor Mike Minotti about recent hardware sales data and the state of Sony/Microsoft. Microsoft has long been criticized for its Xbox first-party output, and Grubb had some interesting, and possibly disturbing things to say about the gaming division. In addition, Grubb also mentioned the somewhat underperforming Hi-Fi Rush.

Managing editor Minotti: ""Do you think management is happy with the state of Xbox right now?""

Grubb said: ""I can tell you, they are not, They're upset. We're just trying to diagnose it a little bit right. You know, they didn't release a first-party game last year, and if that doesn't affect you if you always have something to play again, that's awesome, but a lot of people do regret getting their Xbox.""

On the topic of Hi-fi Rush, Grubb said that the title underperformed financially:

""Based on what I've heard, it just straight up didn't make the money it needed to make. I mean, it got good reviews, the buzz was good, so where do you put the blame for something like that? Is it the price, is it the shadow drop or could it have sold more, or is it Game Pass?""

569,Rent is getting ridiculous.,"Requiring to have an income of 3x your monthly rent is becoming a problem. Even for a single bedroom apartment, it's hard to find anything cheaper than $1,200 a month. Which means you need to make $22.50/hr just to even qualify for one.

In a country where employers believe they're doing God's work by paying someone $16-18 an hour because they're stuck in the 1980s and own a house that only requires a monthly payment of $700.... This is impossibly frustrating.

I had to fight hard with my employer this year to bump me up to $23.50 just so I had some breathing room, because god knows the rent will just keep rising. After a certain amount, that rule I feel becomes negligible.

For example, someone who can qualify for an apartment with a monthly rent of $1600 ($30.00/hr) is going to have a SHIT TON more money for food, remaining bills, other entertainment, etc etc.... Than someone who qualifies for a monthly rent of $1000 ($18.75/hr)

It just doesn't make any sense why this is a rule after a certain amount of rent. Makes it impossible for people to live on their own.

I'm a really busy student and I keep holding onto this idea that once I graduate, it'll all be easier because I'll have more time to cook, but the decision fatigue and texture issues aren't gonna just magically go away.

**Map Rework: Discarded**

The focus of our Discarded rework was to make the infantry gameplay more enjoyable and accessible. New flags have been added, and others have been moved closer to the main play areas, alongside several new paths and roads across the map. Global lighting has also received improvements.

Check out our overview below for a selection of areas that we feel are going to become quite entertaining once this rework goes live!  


https://preview.redd.it/l4mnazykb9va1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ba8e9d8406acd887d5f403dcec5c02ea13c75cb5

**Areas of Improvements**

**Salvage Yards**  
What used to be an open field on the northwest side of the map has become the Salvage Yard. The car wrecks not only fit the theme of Discarded, but also add multiple cover opportunities for soldiers to outsmart the heavy vehicles roaming the area. There are several destructible houses on the outskirts of the flag that can serve as vantage points at the expense of being buried in their rubble.  
**Antenna**  
Whilst already an existing flag, we have brought this flag point closer to the Flooded Village based in the northern region of the map. With this new location, it now provides an improved link between the north area of the map (the green area) with the south (the beach). We reinforced the thought of military occupation by adding various military assets and we have improved the layout by populating the combat space with a few extra structures. You can also climb up the antenna, and parachute or Wingsuit from here down to the Colossus or to the Village.  
 

**Dismantled Hull**

A destroyed convoy and rows of military cover now strengthen the frontlines of this flag.

The smoke from the convoy should conceal approaching players from snipers that may be waiting on the upper floors of the Hull. The core of the flag received a few improvements with military cover as well, allowing for infantry to push in forward less difficulty. Lastly, we closed off part of the side of the hull that faces the Colossus to limit the frequent sniping from the deck of the ship into this flag.

# Other Areas of Focus

**Collection & Customization Improvements**

* Implemented the ability to remove attachments from weapons within the Customization Screen.
* Increased legibility of the Plus Menu in-game by only displaying the attachment category that is being changed
* Improved how attachments are moved and swapped out in the Customization Menu.
* Increased the clarity of descriptive information on how suppressors function within the Collection Screen
* Fixed layout in the Customization screen so that info is displayed in the same place.
* Reduced the amount of steps necessary to get into changing attachments.

**End of Round Improvements**

* Introduced a new Squad Performance screen statistic called “Personal Best”. If you’ve reached a new record for statistics such as most kills, damage dealt, revives, assists, there is a chance for this stat to display for your efforts in going above and beyond on the battlefield.
* During the End of Round flow it’s now possible to skip all the way to the main menu without leaving automatic matchmaking.
* Updated Ribbon progression, increasing legibility of what rank was earned.
* Improved art & animations across all of End of Round.
* Round-based Game Modes will now have side switching enabled, and will now have increased visual communication to indicate what happens after the end of match timer ticks down.

**Specialist Mastery Improvements**

Updated Lis' Mastery requirement to better fit her intended playstyle:

* Old - 10 Kills when destroying Vehicles with the G-84 TGM to 
* New - 10 Kills and Assists when destroying Vehicles with the G-84 TGM 

**Uniform Soldier Aiming**

We're changing the default setting of Uniform Soldier Aiming from Off, to On, for both controller and mouse & keyboard gameplay. This feature is a tool which over time helps your aiming movement to gradually become more consistent during gameplay.

Our reasoning for having Uniform Soldier Aiming turned Off by default in Battlefield 2042 was because in previous Battlefield titles we expected a slower aim rate in zoom to be a benefit in helping players learn to aim. Instead, we have since observed that for both new and experienced players this variance does not promote good muscle memory build up.

576,"Put them in a separate bag, you say?","So where I work, part of my job involves getting specific numbers of specific parts off the shelves and giving them to my coworkers to assemble. The other day, one fellow in particular, let’s call him Luke, came to me.

Luke: “Hey, you know when you pull these four parts from here and these other parts from over there? They look the same, but those four are a little different inside. They need to go in set spots, so I’m wasting time peering closely to identify them. Can you put those four in a separate bag?”

Me: “Sorry, didn’t think of that. Sure.”

So the next time I got one of those sets for him, I made sure to do exactly as he said: each one of those four parts was in a tiny ziplock bag, and the four of them together were in a bigger ziplock bag. And just for good measure, all of the parts in that group wound up in an even bigger ziplock bag.

Little bit later, he comes back and finds me again. I’ll paraphrase the conversation a bit.

Luke: “Hey!”

Me: “Yes?”

Luke: “I know it was you. They don’t all need to be in their own separate bags, inside a bigger bag, inside a bigger bag!”

Me: “You wanted them separate, and it was just for this time.”

583,A Shoutout to 2 Magical Cast Members,"This happened a few weeks ago, but I really wanted to share an incredible experience I had with two very kind cast members. 

It was mid afternoon, and my partner and I were making our way around the world showcase. We forgot our ibuprofen at the hotel, and by this point I had been dealing with a slowly growing headache. We stopped at the Fife & Drum to get some water for both of us, and to take a quick break at the tables behind it. 

As my partner was paying, I asked the cast member at the register if she knew where I could get ibuprofen. She told me about First Aid (never knew they gave out free medicine), and where the nearest one was, and also asked me what was wrong. I explained that I had a headache and she sympathized. Of course, I didn’t expect anything beyond the information I asked for, since everyone gets headaches and it was just a short distance to First Aid. 

But then she and a coworker went an extra mile and it made my day. 

We were still finishing up the transaction and the cast member turned around, filled up a large cup with ice and some Coca Cola, and offered it to me, suggesting the caffeine may help (it does and it did). A second cast member, who had overheard the whole thing, then gave me a pretzel with cheese sauce, free of charge also, saying I should probably eat something too since it was so hot out. 

I don’t know why, but their kindness in such a simple situation made me so emotional. They didn’t need to do any of that, but they did anyway, and it was the first time in a while I felt the true Disney magic.

Here comes the fuck up... When I woke up, I noted my dick feeling super strange, confused, I threw open the covers to reveal that the plastic wrap that kept the fruit rolled, had fused to cock, making it into the most eldritch horror fruit rollup imaginable. The worst part was the pain of tearing it off, it was similar to the sensation of waxing but for your cock. Lesson learned I'll throw my shit away next time.

591,Elf hate is getting annoying,"Clickbait title out of the way. I've just had a guy kick me because he hates the elf in general. I joined his CATA wastes run as a chaos warrior patrol was getting pulled and right away I'm to blame even though they were on top of both of us as I loaded in. Then he kept making claims that elf does nothing for the team (he was playing battle wizard, so I'm not sure what his criteria is for that kind of judgement). 

Joined another run with the same guy later and he runs super far off by himself only to get downed and blame the team. Then he ends the match even though the rest of the team was doing fine. He said to create our own game and take me (elf) with them. 

I just don't get the issue. Yea I know the elf player stereotypes (the memes are usually funny), but at CATA I really don't think its much of a problem. Seriously I want to know, am I wrong? I only play elf so I haven't had any experience with toxic elf players. I've seen plenty of toxic dwarves and wizards though.

I wouldn't wine like this normally, but I only play CATA and the player pool is kind of small. Getting kicked from matches for genuinely no reason makes me big sad, especially because I'm just trying to have fun and make friends :/

597,NOP Q&A with SpacePaladin15,"Sorry for the delay, but here’s the Q&A which was posted here and on the Discord to celebrate the NOP anniversary. Thanks to MythosDythos for picking the least sanity-reducing questions for me lol. I’ve chosen the twenty best questions from the normal ones to address; perhaps some of you recognize your question!

**1. Are there any fanfics you’d like to shout out?**

a. There’s several that I enjoy quite a bit, with Intro to Terran Zoology being an excellent newer one with a great focus and characters. Under the Veil is interesting for those who enjoy alternate universes.

**2. Have you ever thought your story would blow up the way it did?**

a. This is a question that predates NOP, but I certainly never expected any of my stories to take off the way it did. I almost got too nervous to even post by first one-shot at all. It took hours to work up the nerve to submit it to HFY, in the late hours of the night. I was overwhelmed by 25 upvotes…and woke up to five hundred lol.

NOP was always a passion project, a trope I enjoyed getting much from the days of Prey, and I think it’s a good moral for writing what you want to write. The easiest way to ruin a story is to try to change yourself or please everyone.

Also, if you’re shy about posting your story, you never know; you might be the next thing to blow up on HFY. Not everyone will like your writing, but that’s okay. We all start somewhere, learn and grow, and if you share it with a few people who enjoyed it, I think it’s a net positive!

**3. How much time do you spend writing each week? As a fanfic writer, I'd be interested to know!**

a. A lot…the average chapter takes hours just to write, and there’s 4 a week counting bonus content. That’s not to mention time spent planning, polishing, and promoting (the three P’s). Wouldn’t be a Paladin story without the cheesy Reddit notes and the sarcastic discord jokes, right?

Fun fact; NOP is on RoyalRoad and Wattpad too, so uploading to each site takes a chunk of time too.

**4. Do you get a dopamine rush from our despair every time you conclude a chapter with a cliffhanger?**

a. Yes. More on that to come. People may be displeased with where I’m choosing to end a certain chapter in the next ten, and I will relish the complaints of how cruel I am! Gotta have a little fun at your expense.

**5. How widespread is anti-human racism in the Venlil worlds?**

a. So in a spoiler-free way, I think the bonus stories show how the average Venlil has come around since Cilany’s interview. A few still fear us, or see us as Sovlin does; bloodlusting monsters who control their instincts with empathy. Rural areas are not partial to humans, as we saw in Chapter 87. Cities are better due to acclimation to refugees.

**6. Which NoP character would you most want to hang out with for a day?**

a. Honestly, any of the aliens just because they’re aliens. But for personality, I would go with Tarva from the aliens and Noah from the humans. Who is more of a loyal friend than the Governor, and who has done more for peace and the greater good than Noah? They’re calm personalities with moral strength and compassion.

**7. What has happened to Kalsim?**

a. I felt that Kalsim’s story and his trial date was set in stone, and that his arc had reached a logical conclusion. Following his interview with Cilany, his trial commenced with some poor Venlil stuck representing him as his lawyer. Whether through the death penalty or lifelong imprisonment at best, his efforts have come to an end.

Kalsim is a bit of a Knight-Templar trope, someone who does evil, believes he is right, and will not change. His mindset on us is static, barring his “regret” of not knowing that he could’ve cured humans. Listening to rhetoric that reflects the density of a black hole might be tedious for the readership.

**8. How popular** ***is*** **Tarva among Venlil? Her administration has seen radical, society altering changes that clearly not everyone supports.**

a. Tarva is a controversial figure come re-election, after locking down borders and exposing her own kind to predators, who she seems to love and think of more than the Venlil. The Republic has taken economic damage after leaving the Federation. This has drawn a great deal of criticism, and that’s without them knowing she’s negotiating with Isif.

It’s yet to be seen if popular policies such as the rescue of the Venlil cattle, and the political winds following Cilany, will be enough to grant her a victory.

**9. Are there any parts in the story that you wish you'd have written differently?**

a. The beginning. I’m in the process of adding rewrites to Chapters 1-7, which add more dialogue, thoughts, lore and details to the original chapters. Among other things, Sara now tells Noah in the first chapter that he talks more than a streamer!

**10. When will we see more from Nulia?**

a. Her next direct appearance is Chapter 114. On a completely unrelated note, Christmas will be mentioned in main canon…

**11. How common are uplifts and how long does the indoctrination take?**

a. Uplifts in some capacity are common, even if it’s taking an early spacefaring society to an FTL power. Glim mentions how unusual it is that the “Gaians” discovered FTL on their own, which is part of why tech is both stagnant and homogenous (as the Kolshians want it. Advancements that out the conspiracy are hidden in every field, from archaeology to ecology to psychology).

How long the indoctrination takes depends how stubborn a species is, but I’d say it’s complete around two generations…when the memory of the pre-Federation society is gone.

**12. Will Humanity First make a reappearance? There hasn't been a peep about them since the bombing.**

a. Humanity First are an idea, the dark side of humanity that will exist (even in an HFY story). They must be managed and prepared for, because we aren’t a perfect species. It’s also the suggestion that appeasing xenos too far isn’t the way to go; it alienates your own people. The leadership must placate that ideal, or risk the consequences.

To answer the question, they won’t play a direct role in the story again. Perhaps a mention, or talk of unrest. But strands of their rhetoric seep through with Samantha, sometimes Zhao in his paranoia of protecting Earth, and especially bonus character William Kane (an outright racist against certain xenos, for those not on Patreon).

**13. What's your favorite piece of fanart the community has made?**

a. Anything by DemonDeity. No, that was my serious answer! The Jimek sketch was my personal request and is canon, but the other stuff is excellent too. DD has a knack for drawing Gojids in particular, as seen with the bloodied Sovlin and Tyler, gamer Nulia, and the adorable pencil sketch of Siffy and Nulia playing.

**14. How do you deal with the pressure from your readers?**

a. Accepting the reality that I can’t please everyone is important. Changing your story to a major extent is a no-no, barring any valid criticisms. I could play it safe, avoid the twists, kicks to humanity’s teeth, cliffhangers, and scenes such as the bombing and the much-maligned capture of Siffy in 88, but it’d make for a boring narrative.

Creative ideas should be sourced internally, not externally. That’s not to say I don’t care what people think; I don’t let it influence the direction of the story. The times I have tried to do what I thought the fans wanted in the past, I felt untrue to myself and have regretted it.

Never try to write what you think people want you to write. It’ll become forced, and you may end up second-guessing, dreading writing, and hating your work!

**15. Favorite emote on the server?**

a. :arxur\_high: obviously

**16. Was there anything that the readers/community latched onto that surprised you? If so, what?**

a. The Exterminators (the show)! For those who don’t know, that was originally a lore iceberg tidbit with I put in the Harchen wiki entry. I shared some fun facts about the newest species on the subreddit, so that one wasn’t even in the main canon. But it’s taken off in the fanon since, so it wound up being mentioned multiple times by Slanek and also in bonus content.

**17. What percentage of the galaxy has been explored by the federation?**

a. The Federation is only a small corner of the Milky Way galaxy, in a few thousand light year radius (really, just our wing of the galaxy). It’s one month’s travel from us to Sivkits at 4.5ly/h, so that’s 3240 light-years. Sounds like a lot, but once again—space is really big. Our galaxy is one hundred thousand light years across! The entirety of human civilization is a drop in the bucket compared to how long it’d take light from our sun to cross the Milky Way.

Nerdy ramblings aside, the majority of the galaxy is an unknown, and could be explored in far future NOP continuations. One of the snippets that Noah mentions in Chapter 74 is ark ships, which were sent out to unknown places beyond Federation territory, in case Battle of Earth ended with humanity extinct….

**18. What's motivated you to keep the story up for over a hundred chapters now?**

a. The fans’ passion and my own love of the concept and the universe gives me energy. Even when I’m not writing, I think about NOP all the time. I can’t watch or do anything without thinking “Wow, that’s predatory” now. (Like playing the opening scene of God of War \[2018\], that was in the back of my mind).

If I didn’t love the NOP story and its premise,  I’d never keep up the rigorous update schedule. Every time I hit the pages, I’m excited to flesh out what I had in my mind’s eyes, and see how it translates to paper. I’m always excited to see what people say; I do read every comment on Patreon and Reddit.

**19. In terms of percentage, how far are you in the NoP story?**

a. I get asked this a lot, namely for an estimate of the chapters, and people are frustrated with my “it’ll be done when I’ve told the story” answer. We’re more than halfway, and I think people will see what the endgame is soon. I’ve thrown out ballpark numbers just since people want a figure, but don’t hold me to that!

(Also, NOP may continue past the originally planned story into a future timeline. There are some open threads, and those stories might keep the same name).

**20. What made you start writing stories?**

a. I’ll let you all in on a secret: I loved writing when I was a kid! Used to write in a journal all the way back in elementary school, and had a few stories that I’d tinker with. I gave it up for a little bit, but came back to it during COVID when free time abounded. Putting my own spin on fun HFY tales, as a lifelong fan of the sci-fi genre, seemed like something fun to do.",1682098043.0
598,DRS Book has always been the way 🟣🟣🟣,"Apparently there's some discussion again regarding the book vs. plan debate, so I'd like to reiterate what we figured out last year when this came up..

A lot of the confusion (I think) is due to the Computershare team not understanding the question and then making a statement that they are functionally the same. Yes, I guess to most casual investors they are. 

But GME investors are concerned with their shares' complete withdrawal from the DTCC and not using fractional shares for locates. This is the part getting lost when asking cs for guidance, and the part causing the most confusion. 

That's why the general consensus here in the Jungle has always been that ""book"" is best! If you go back and reread the original Computershare DDs, this is debated in real time, and I have changed position on this myself early on when new information came to light. Also remember the un-enrolling from the DRIP will automatically sell any fractional shares you have (I paperhanded for science and found out the hard way!) But there is plenty of info, both old and new, that discusses this issue in detail. There are resources across reddit and YouTube, many linked in the pinned comment across this sub.

I'd also like to say that I will be looking into the Computershare DD pin issue because those should always be pinned all the time!! (Edit: I think it's fixed!)

**The Jungle always has and always will support full share ownership and withdrawal with ""book"" registered shares!!**

599,We are here to help.,"Sucking nervously on his antennae, Kr’zix’x rocked back and forth on the seat, four of the eight legs tucked up under the abdomen, the rest either tapping nervously on the floor or frantically typing on various keypads, alternating the signal frequency of the planetary distress call was broadcasted through.In the background, the repeated message on the broadcast echoed, along with the glaring sound of the environmental alarm outside.   


Kr’zix’x didn’t dare look at the surveillance monitors showcasing the exterior city, there was only so much death one could muster to look at and whatever was left of sanity in Kr’zix’x’s mind, needed to be preserved, the task too important.“*Planetary distress call! Planetary distress call! Coordinates: <digitized string of astronomical coordinates>. Planet hit by a pulsar gamma ray burst! The atmosphere is dissipating rapidly. Requesting immediate aid!*”

It went on repeat, on as many frequencies the system could handle.

The task was futile, Kr’zix’x felt. All that kept the population from total annihilation right now, was the containment fields, green houses and other dwellings that could sustain some sort of shielding, but they would not last.  


It had been months since the gamma ray hit the planet, out of nowhere it had struck, evaporating the atmosphere, causing the air in the bodies of billions to expand rapidly in the sudden vacuum appearing, causing unimaginable pain and suffering before, finally, death.What remained of the atmosphere, caught on the far side of the planet, spread out along the surface shortly after, but it is hardly enough to sustain life. The planet, far out in an arm of a galaxy, was poor, both in tech and economy, at least compared to the rest of the Galactic Federation.  


The Galactic Federation was a slow and cumbersome beast, with bureaucratic processes that could take what felt like a full rotation around the galactic centre, before a dry response with rejection of the application due to a misspelt word, would plop into the mailbox, prompting the whole process to start anew.  


They were the first to be contacted, a dire request of emergency aid to be sent, only to have the distress call be stamped, put in a drawer, looked at, stamped again, put in a different drawer, found, lost, found again, then stamped with a denial seal. It was too far, the planet too poor to pay the expenditure cost of the aid and the lack of a comma where a semicolon should be, was in breach of proper documentation process and not to be forgotten, the missed membership payment. In lieu of this, as well as the notified projected issues of being able to fulfil future payments due to racial termination, the planet's membership with the Galactic Federation was terminated, effective within two galactic standard months, unless payment could be processed during this time period.  


Kr’zix’x sat there, nervously sucking on an antennae, cradling two of the front legs close to the chest. The static of the receiver was a constant hiss, as it had been for the last few months. Silence was all there was from the void of space. At first, Kr’zix’x didn’t notice the slight pulse modulation in the static, a slight tone that seemed to meld into the constant noise emitting from the speakers on the wall.  


Then the speakers went dead silent. Kr’zix’x sprung out of the chair, frantically grabbing one of the speakers, shaking it, finding the action not helping, then tracing the cables to the amplifier, then the receiver.

“No, no, no, no, no, no, not now, no”  


Panic set into Kr’zix’x’s voice, pitching ever higher. The amplifier was fine, the speaker was fine, it had to be the discs outside. Panic induced shudders caused stiff hair on Kr’zix’x’s abdomen to shed forcefully as Kr’zix’x frantically adjusted the camera angle with a controller, trying to make the cameras point to the sky.  


Kr’zix’x froze.  


A shadow spanned across the entire sky. What most resembled a planet appeared to be on a collision course.Kr’zix’x snapped out of it, rushing to the console, altering the distress signal.  


“*Planetary distress call! Planetary distress call! Coordinates: <digitized string of astronomical coordinates>. Planet hit by a pulsar gamma ray burst! The atmosphere is dissipating rapidly. Unknown astrological object on collision course! Requesting immediate aid!*”  


The voice cracked as Kr’zix’x cried into the microphone. The end was near, it was futile. Kr’zix’x slunk back into the chair, legs drooping down on the sides. An arm reached out and hit a play button and a musical piece started playing, replacing the distress call. It was a great, classical piece, sung by a children's choir, accompanied with a melody played on silk string harps.   
If anything, if Kr’zix’x’s race was to disappear into the void, this would be their last words into it.  


Kr’zix’x sprang out of the chair and several instances back towards the wall on the far side away from the speakers,  when they suddenly flared to life. Music? But this was not the music Kr’zix’x broadcasted. It was melodious, played by instruments Kr’zix’x had never heard before.Then thunderous booms thundered through the thin atmosphere, high up. At first, Kr’zix’x believed this was the planet sized object finally making contact with the plane and Kr’zix’x closed tearful eyes.

This. was. The end. Kr'zix'x was certain of this fact.Kr’zix’x slumped to the floor, crying. Then there were more booms. Then the sounds of.. Thruster engines? Kr’zix’x sprang to action, running over to the monitors, frantically controlling the cameras.Ships. Lots of them. Kr’zix’x had never seen so many ships and especially not of this design. They all seemed to be emerging from the planet sized.. Ship? And they all appeared to be heading to their own location around the planet.

“Oh, no.. no, no, no, nonononono, please don’t be slavers..” Kr’zix’x pleaded mentally, but that quickly went into a more ecstatic feeling. “SLAVERS! We’re saved! We’ll live!” Kr’zix’x cried out, dropping down on all eight knees, raising the arms salutary towards the ceiling.  


Then the music faded and a voice appeared on top of the music, the music itself seemed to calm down.  


*“Do not be alarmed. We have heard your call of duress. We have come to help. Stand by for planetary emergency evacuation.”*  


Kr’zix’x paused and stared at the speakers, jaws almost at floor level. Kr’zix’x had no idea what the voice said, it was a totally foreign language and the Galactic Federation standard translator did not recognize it.  


Staring at the monitors, Kr’zix’x saw one of the ships heading straight for the broadcasting antennae and landing gently next to it. The sides of the ship opened up and at the same time, what seemed like a bubble, erupted from the ship and outwards.  


Picking Jaws up from the floor, Kr'zix'x zoomed in, as bipedal creatures, all dressed in white, rushed out of the ship, one dressed in a bright yellow version, apparently the leader, as the rest rushed wherever it pointed.  


They moved quickly, rushing over to the bodies of brethren, showering each body in a bright blue light, before moving on to the next. Suddenly, the light flashed with bright yellow and a flurry of movement occurred as several rushed over to the body, lifting it up and carrying it to and inside the ship.  


Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, causing Kr'zix'x to jump into the ceiling, banging the head hard. As the world went dark, Kr'zix'x saw one of the creatures enter the room and pause.

  
When Kr'zix'x came to, the room was clad in a bluish light. This was not the broadcast station, Kr'zix'x thought calmly, looking around.

  
All appendixes accounted for, Kr'zix'x observed. Each of the grippers pointed towards the ceiling were fully functional.

The air was.. Abundant. Rich. As if Kr'zix'x was in the jungles down south, enjoying a hike among the fungi cap stalk trees.

Kr'zix'x turned the gaze towards what seemed to be a small gadget, lying on the conveniently placed table next to the.. Bed?

Kr'zix'x sat up abruptly, the head aching profusely. Gently touching the tender  spot where the head hit the ceiling, Kr'zix'x noticed that the head was bandaged.

Looking at the gadget, Kr'zix'x rolled over to the proper side, legs down. Prodding the device gently and very carefully, Kr'zix'x noticed a blinking light and what appeared to be a button. Against better judgement, with wild curiosity, it was pushed.

The light around Kr'zix'x dimmed and the music Kr'zix'x broadcasted at the end, started playing, before a holographic projection emerged over the device.

It showed the planet, orbited by the giant ship. All of the small ships seemed to be moving back to it, leaving the planet. Once they were all aboard, Kr'zix'x saw an holographic presentation of the creatures.   


Bipedal, with only four limbs in total. Then it shifted into what could best be described as a graphic presentation of what had happened. Kr'zix'x saw the broadcasting station, heard the distress signal, then saw the signals travel from the planet, through the void, far out into the far reaches of the galaxy arm.

It zoomed into a small solar system, ending up at the 3rd planet from the sun. With what seemed like a rapid, sped up time lapse, the ship Kr'zix'x apparently we're currently on, was built and then.. Moving towards the signal.

Letters appeared in front of Kr'zix'x, first in an alien language, then warping into the language of Kr'zix'x's race.

Kr'zix'x's eyes started to water as the projection showed first Kr'zix'x's body, then a number. Then another body and the number increased. More bodies rapidly added to the counter, appearing more of a blur than anything else.

In the end the number stopped, showing a depressingly low number compared to how many they were. They had managed to save but a few tens of millions, out of the several billions. Yet, they were alive and, hopefully, safe and sound.

Kr'zix'x smiled and looked away from the projection, wiping a tear. Then noticed the creature standing next to the bed. This made Kr'zix'x jump half-way across the room from a sitting position. It was an inherited ability of the species Kr'zix'x's species evolved from, although being easily scared was entirely on Kr'zix'x.

The creature looked towards Kr'zix'x with two eyes and bared its teeth, yet it did not seem imposing, where it stood with the arms folded behind its back.

It spoke. Kr'zix'x didn't understand a word, so just resigned to stare blankly at the creature. The creature leaned forward and touched the holographic device, which chimed to life.

It spoke again, but this time, the holographic device made text appear in what seemed like a cartoonish speech bubble next to the creatures head:

""We heard your distress call.""

Kr'zix'x froze for a few seconds.

""Who.. No, what.. Are you?"" Kr'zix'x asked.

The creature bared its teeth again, it must be a way of expressing themselves, much like how we sway our bodies and use our limbs, Kr'zix'x realised.

""We are human."" it spoke. ""We are here to help.""

602,My (30F) husband is too stressed to be affectionate everyday (32M),"We have been together 10 years, recently married. For the first few years it was great, lots of kissing, intimacy, sex. Then about 5 years ago lot of stressful life events happened that affected his mental health so badly he couldnt work for the past 1.5 years. I supported him through this. He learned recently that he has OCD and anxiety, I had been pushing for him to get diagnosed for years and he finally started to see someone and is making some progress.

He's now started a new min. wage job in a new industry to work 3-4 days per week and is studying part time. I'm still supporting him but he's still so stressed all the time. I feel like after everything that has happened, my empathy is completely blown. I just can't bring myself to care anymore, when everyday is ""the most stressful day he's ever had"", followed by a meltdown about twice a week, I've just got nothing left to give. I used to console him for hours but I just can't anymore. I can barely acknowledge his stress when he talks about it everyday. All I'm thinking about is when he pushes me away at night because he's too anxious. Or doesn't want to ever have sex because he's too anxious. We just had our longest dry spell of a month and I'm losing my mind. I'm questioning why am I even in this relationship when it just feels like I'm always at the bottom of his list.

I've talked to him about it, he says he'll try harder and that hes just stressed. Tonight I tried to talk to him again as he's still pushing me away, and he said this is the most stressed he's ever been and I'm not being supportive, what ive said is borderline inappropriate given what hes going through. And that maybe he can't be affectionate on days he's working. He says when he's less stressed he'll be fine, but we don't have kids, he works part time, I make enough for both of us to live comfortably whether he works or not.

I can't tell if I'm being unreasonable, my desire has not subsided one bit after 10 years together and it's so hard being rejected physically everyday. I guess I'm looking for advice to see if I should cut him some slack? I just don't know, I can't imagine life ever getting less stressful enough that he can finally be affectionate with me. We want to have kids soon which I feel is going to make everything more stressful, I dont really have long left to have kids so I can't just keep putting things off until everything's better.",1682087292.0

605,Society only thinks it’s appropriate for women to have standards and not men,"Surveys and peer-reviewed articles published in scholarly journals have shown that both men and women have preferences when it comes to the sexual histories of their partners. Men and women are more or less equally reluctant to partner up with people possessing extensive sexual histories, and heterosexual women are far less likely than men to date partners with few-to-no experiences or same-sex experiences. 

For the most part, however, only men’s preferences in this regard are subject to social shaming and highly scrutinized, and that’s what we’re pushing back on. When women have preferences, they can and do express them freely, without scrutiny or harassment. When men have preferences, those preferences are deemed misogynistic by both men and women.

**Women discriminate against promiscuous partners at similar rates as men**

> Thus, contrary to the idea that male promiscuity is tolerated but female promiscuity is not, both sexes expressed equal reluctance to get involved with someone with an overly extensive sexual history. (pg.1097)

> Targets were more likely to be derogated as the number of sexual partners increased, and this effect held for both male and female targets.

> Second, we found considerable overlap between the responses of men and women. Men were slightly more forgiving of a large sexual history than women, but this effect was small and tracked the same “pattern” as women. In short, there was very little evidence for a “double standard.""

> We proposed that sexual promiscuity would negatively affect responses toward both gay and straight men, and tested the effects of sexual promiscuity along with femininity and masculinity—traits directly tied to gender role expectations… women report increased negativity toward sexually promiscuous gay men, mediated by concern for disease threats. We also found support for the influence of gender roles, as heterosexual men reported decreased prejudice toward unambiguously masculine gay men. Both heterosexual women and men consistently reported increased social distancing toward sexually promiscuous straight men (pg.74)

> Intriguingly, men and women closely agree on the ideal number of lifetime sexual partners – and their opinions weren’t too far off from the reality. Women said 7.5 is the ideal number of partners – only 0.5 partners above their actual average. Men cited 7.6 as the ideal number of partners, which is 1.2 fewer than their own actual average… Our female respondents said they perceive the threshold for being too promiscuous is 15.2 partners, while men consider 14 the defining number when it comes to promiscuity.

**Women discriminate against bisexual men and men with same-sex experiences at far higher rates than men**

> Results indicated that heterosexual women rated bisexual men as less sexually and romantically attractive, less desirable to date and have sex with, and less masculine compared to straight men. No such differences were found for heterosexual and gay men’s ratings of female and male profiles, respectively. These results support previous research findings that indicate more negative attitudes toward dating bisexual men than bisexual women. (pg.516)

**Final Thoughts**

Body count is the strongest predictor of [infidelity](https://archive.ph/H9cJM), [divorce, dissatisfaction](https://archive.ph/lgwYz), in addition to [STDs, substance abuse disorders, mental health issues, etc](https://archive.ph/Ti7VK). Those with [unrestricted sociosexual orientations](https://archive.ph/FtwFW) (considered by psychologists to be a stable personality characteristic) tend to separate sex from intimacy, find it more difficult than commit to monogamous relationships, and have higher rates or relationship dissatisfaction, making infidelity significantly more likely. Men historically avoided committing to partners with promiscuous histories because they [represented higher paternity fraud](https://archive.ph/bRSMC) risks. 

Men and women are equally reluctant to date people with [extensive sexual histories](https://archive.ph/Bbl70), and heterosexual women are far less likely than heterosexual males to date partners with [little-to-no experience or past same-sex experiences](https://archive.ph/Bbl70), but society only punishes men for having preferences.",1682086408.0

607,Fuck Spicejet - Glad I used Airsewa to hold them accountable,"tldr - Missed flight because Spicejet didn't send boarding pass and the staff at the airport did not cooperate. Manager challenged me to file a grievance - so I did, successfully

\------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of months ago, I had to take a Spicejet flight from Mumbai, and I web-checked in the day before. On the day of the flight, on the cab ride to the airport, I saw that I hadn't received my boarding pass even though the site said ""your board pass will be generated and issued shortly"". I reached the airport 1 hour before departure (tight I know, but I planned for it because I travel without check-in luggage) and still no boarding pass.

As the Spicejet counter was on the other end of the airport, I thought I'd calling the customer care would be faster. On call, the customer service agent says ""You have web checked in with auto seat assignment, but if you pay a fee for a preferred seat I can issue the pass to you"" - essentially holding my ticket hostage?

I gave up and went to the spicejet counter to ask for the boarding pass. Neither the spicejet staff, the passengers nor the Spicejet manager would let me through even after my explaining the issue - ""All these other passengers are also waiting, you wait in the line I cannot help you"" is what everyone said. By the time I reached the counter, it was 30 mins before departure and the lady said sorry sir I can't issue Boarding Pass now.

I was pissed so I went to the same manager and told him how Spicejet's systems & staff prevented me from boarding this flight and his response was - you should have reached 3 hours early and that ""I can't help you here, you will be counted as a no show toh no refund, chahiye toh grievance file kar do"".

Which is exactly what I did through the Airsewa portal and I made it a point to include the ID details of the manager in the grievance report. In the first 3 days, the Spicejet nodal officer issued an apology and 2 months later I finally received a refund.

Fuck Spicejet, that is all. I'm just glad they got held accountable for their behaviour.",1682049682.0

647,Update: Not the dress I ordered!,"Just wanted to provide an update from my last post where I was concerned that the dress I received from Grace Loves Lace was different to the sample I tried on in their showroom. 

Thank you to everyone who validated my feelings and made me feel like I wasn’t going crazy! The more and more I looked into it, I became convinced that the dresses were different. The colour, the train, the sleeves, the neckline and the quality of the lace being the most obvious differences- there were also suggestions from a professional that another panel had been added into the waistline. 

Well, turns out, they ARE different dresses! 

Here is part of the email I received from the Grace Loves Lace team: 

“they are most likely made by different people as our Olive gown in the showrooms are the very first gowns made of a design when we released her.”

So there you have it. When they released the gown originally, they were made by different people. Whether people refers to a factory, or individuals within the same factory, who knows, but what’s clear is that the interpretation of the design, or the design and material, has changed since they made the sample gown. 

To the people that suggested I offer to swap my gown for the sample, I love you! They have agreed to this and are going to offer me the sample at a discount, so I’ll get some money back, as well as the dress of my dreams. It will need a slight fix where the lace has come away from the lining but otherwise it seems good to go. 

To be fair, they have been really nice about this situation. And I’m really happy with the solution they have provided.

Fortunately, I managed to use this into my favour and then take the match to the end, which was the most difficult thing.

673,I (29f) caught my (30m) husband lying to me about where he was after work.,"I caught my husband lying to me about where he was

I 29 female, caught my 30 male husband in a car with another woman 40 female after he told me he was going to be running to town to pick something up, Just for context, about two years ago before we were married, I used to go out and have drinks with my coworkers both male and female. I would let my my fiancé at the time know that I was going out if and answer, any questions that he had about it. Just got out of hand and I was going out just about every night I have since apologized for my behavior during that time as I would leave him alone at home with our children, and be out till 2 o’clock in the morning. I apologize to him, and we had moved on as I had gotten pregnant with our third child and begin to plan our wedding. We got married about seven months ago. For the past several months I have noticed that my husband was coming home later than normal with different excuses as to what he was doing after work there would be a two hour time gaps from when he got off work to when he arrived home and he would eat dinner and then go straight to our garage and be there the rest of the night. I was starting to feel neglected as I was taking care of the all the household, chores and children, and just sitting there by myself all night. 
I would ask him if he wanted to do anything, and he would just shrug me off and he will just hang out until the garage until I fell asleep. So I began to suspect that something was going on. Several times we had made plans to watch a movie together after the kids had gone to sleep but he would ditch me and claim he had projects that he needed to complete. The other day as I was driving down the road I saw him parked on the side of the road with another vehicle behind him. He unprovoked he texted me that he was helping another another male friend load pots into his car. I brushed it off and just assumed that he was doing. however, my gut was telling me something else was going on. So the next day I was on my way home and he told me he was going to head over to the next town over to go pick something up. But it was eating away at me and I decided to go see where he was at. I found him on the side of the road with a female coworker. They were sitting in her vehicle windows, all steamed up as they have been sitting there for an hour, he gets out of her truck and comes and talks to me and tells me that he ran out of gas which was a lie. As this is now happened five times so that I know of when I questioned him later on over text, he said that they would sit there and talk about life and things that they have in common, but what annoys me the most is that he doesn’t sit there and talk to me or hang out with me, but took the time away from myself and our children to go hang out with another woman and confide in her about our relationship. I don’t know what to do now.",1682093550.0

680,Tile Work,"I work as a elevator constructor. Building the elevators and getting them inspected and turned over to public use. 

So on a jobsite I had a tile worker ask me if I could bring his loads of tile up to every floor for him. This was a old building being retrofit for apartments, 12 stories tall. So him and his three coworkers didn't have to lug it up the stairs.

I said I could do it at the end of the day once I was done for two cases of beer and two handles of Jameson. Off the clock on my own time. He said yup that's a deal to me. Okay, just bring them to the jobsite tomorrow and I'll have all your tile moved to each floors landing lobby.

Next day I see him coming in with nothing. Go ask him about my payment. As he's taking pictures of the tile on third floor landing.

Oh well I forgot about it but I'll get it to begin of bext week. Now I'm a little passed off but go okay. He keeps going to each floor taking pictures of the tile. Then takes off from the jobsite.

At this point I tell my helper we're going to bring all the tile down for them at the end of the day. Now we work four ten hour days and off Fridays. So we decided to come in late Monday morning, I had a ""Dr appointment"".

Arrive at the jobsite Monday at nine o'clock and walk into the building. He comes running out screaming at me about his tile. Along with a nice dressed gentleman. I ask what's the problem?  All my tile is back on first floor. Bummer dude you remember those two case of beer and jameson I was supposed to get?
Now nice dressed gentleman, turns out to be the owner of the tile company, ask me what's going on. 

So I end up telling him what I agreed with dude on Wednesday morning about moving the tile for him. He turns around and tells dude the four of them to start humping up the tile to each floor. Without pay since they stole pay from him last week and didn't do any work. 

They ended up having to spend the next two days doing some heavy lifting up all those stairs.",1682102558.0

684,TIFU by eating a cheat meal alone,"No throwaway since I own my mistake.

Yesterday I was halfway through a very strict diet regime in which I’m restricting carbohydrates from my meals for six months due to my obesity getting out of hand.

My partner suggested for me to not break the diet under any circumstance and I was having an iron will all through this time lapse.

UNTIL YESTERDAY

I received one of those condescending emails from Dominoes with the likes of “We miss you”.

Me being the fat ass that I am fell under temptation of a cheesy crust pepperoni pizza.

I couldn’t let my partner know what I was about to do, so I prepared myself to order a Large cheesy crust pepperoni pizza, no soda (mind the diet)

When she feel asleep by 9:00pm I prepared the deed. My game room is far away so she’s unbothered by me making noise, so I “planned” a game night. 

I knew the pizza box would be too noticeable and hard to sneak, thrash collectors do their round on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays so I was out of luck. Went to the kitchen cabinet and found a tupper almost empty, I did mental measurements of a Large slice of pizza and came to the conclusion that overlapping all 8 slices would fit perfectly. So I washed the tupper, dried it and set the order for pickup (there’s a dominoes one block away from my home, I’m fat what do you expect?) and sat watching the order get ready on my phone, cleaning the amounts of saliva that could fill a bath tub.

When it was ready I rushed outside and went to pay for it, I have never been more anxious in my life about eating, I sat on one of the tables at the restaurant, opened the box and I almost cummed from the smell, it was glorious!! 

Head in the game, I slapped myself and opened the Tupperware that I VERY SNEAKILY put in a small backpack, and started placing like little babies every slice of pepperoni cheesy pizza. I have no idea what the employees could be thinking, but imagine a fat bastard at 10:00pm putting a to go pizza in a Tupperware.

The hard part was done, time to go back home. 

I get there, went to the game room and began the most delicious meal I ever had in my life while watching Dr. Stone. But i failed to factor one of the variables of the problem. 

THE SMELL was so intense I was sure there was no way I could hide it, so I resorted to the old reliable. Opening the windows, mind you where I live at night weather is close the 4 degrees Celsius, so I was freezing but enjoying my pizza.

Obviously I ate the whole shit in less that 30 minutes and downed with a gallon of water.

Here’s the fuck up

I was in a carb restricted diet for 3 months, obviously my digestive tract wasn’t ready for the amount of bread, sugar and sauce that I devoured last night.

Here I lie dying from stomach cramps and shitting fire from my anus due to the excessive amount of pepperoni I ingested, and my partner is about to take to the hospital, wish me luck!

TLDR. Fat fuck ate a whole large pepperoni cheesy pizza while on a 3 month carb restricted diet and is en route to the hospital.",1682085138.0

“See? I was just trying to help you.”

I watched as the queen bastion bee slowly fluttered up to the sky. Her wings buzzed weakly behind her, and she could hardly carry her own bodyweight. But… she was flying now.

She hadn’t even been able to move her head just half an hour ago. However, after removing the arrow puncturing her sides and giving her a cure for the poison afflicting her, she was able to quickly recover thanks to the help of a healing potion. 

The entire time I was carrying out this… pseudo-surgery, the colony of bastion bees tried to fight me off. They were unsuccessful. Very unsuccessful. I didn’t even glance back once as they continuously assailed me with their stingers. 

But once I had given the queen the cure, she must have realized I was there to help her. And with a single twitch of her antennae, she commanded them to stop their onslaught of attacks. Then giving a healing potion was easy, and I just had to wait until she recovered.

Now, she had mostly recovered. And she bowed her head at me gratefully. I just smiled at her, but then she raised her head. Her antennae twitched as a somber look crossed her face— an apologetic expression. 

The hive descended, landing on the ground in what almost seemed to be a prostrating position. Like they were bowing at me to apologize. 

“It’s fine,” I said, waving a hand dismissively. “None of your workers actually managed to hurt me. You don’t have to apologize to me.”

The queen bastion bee cocked her head. But her workers didn’t budge. I just snorted as I gestured vaguely back towards the entrance of the cavern.

“If you really apologize to someone, go and apologize to Dorien. I’m pretty sure you guys hurt his feelings by attacking him.”

The colony of bastion bees raised their heads. The queen’s mandibles clicked together, and she slowly drifted forward. I watched as she flew past me, heading down the tunnel. She paused as she glanced back at me one last time. I nodded and trailed after her.

Her hive didn’t follow. They remained idle while their queen flew with me by her side. She was still in a weakened state, so she couldn’t move too quickly. I was pretty sure that she was still trying to readjust to flying after lying inert for a few months.

We exited the cavern soon enough. The sun had already set; it was nighttime at this point, so it was completely dark. Dorien was waiting for us right outside— just where I had left him. He blinked when he saw the queen, before dashing forward.

“You did it!” he exclaimed.

“Yeah,” I said as I handed him a half-empty vial. It was the cure— there was still some of the magical antidote left. “Here, I didn’t use it all.”

“Right, thank you.” The \[Druid\] accepted it, before quickly pocketing it into his bag. 

A soft buzzing drew his attention to the side, and he turned to face the queen bastion bee. She was staring at him with her bulbous red eyes— they shimmered briefly as he gaped in awe. Her mandibles fluttered as a clicking sound left her mouth.

Was she… talking to Dorien? Apparently so.

“O-oh, you don’t have to apologize, Queen Quebi,” he said as he bowed his head. 

“Quebi?” I asked with a raised brow. “Did you name her?”

He shook his head. “That is the name she had given herself.”

“I see.” I just watched as the \[Druid\] and the queen bastion bee continued their conversation.

Slowly, she spread her mandibles wide open as I narrowed my eyes. Dorien himself was taken aback. But he wasn’t alarmed. He just opened his mouth wide.

“I—” he started. 

And a green liquid started to drip from her mandibles. She secreted a glowing ooze as Dorien’s eyes went wide. He quickly cupped his hands together before reaching out to collect whatever it was.

“What’s she doing?” I asked curiously. “That’s not acid, right?”

Dorien spoke with trembling lips as the green liquid poured into his palms. “She’s giving us her honey— she’s never given anyone her honey before!”

I blinked, watching as the queen bastion bee drew back and turned to face me. She ushered me towards her, and I stuck a hand out too. Her honey began to pour out into my hand as I frowned.

“This…”

It was slightly hot. It wasn’t scalding or anything, but it was visibly steaming under the night sky. I brought a finger up and nibbled on the honey. And I paused as the spicy taste entered my mouth.

“What are you doing?” Dorien stared at me in horror. “That’s a bastion bee’s honey— the rarest honey in the world! Why are you just…?”

“It is kinda sweet, but it doesn’t taste like honey,” I muttered as I licked my fingers clean. “It’s spicy, and it also has a bit of an earthy taste too. I…”

I turned to face the \[Druid\]. He just looked at me, utterly confused. But I grinned in return. 

“I think I can make a pretty damn good curry out of this.”

He just blinked back at me. “What?”

I shook my head, glancing back at the queen bastion bee. “Hey, can I have more of your honey? Wait— you can understand me, right?”

Bucky could understand me, so I assumed the queen bastion bee could understand me too. After all, wasn’t Bucky only C-rank or something? Meanwhile, the queen bastion bee was supposedly an A-ranked threat.

Dorien cleared his throat.

“I… Quebi is able to comprehend your intentions, but she does not understand your words.” He eyed her hesitantly, and she nodded, making a soft warbling sound. “She’s asking you how much money do you want?”

“Preferably, I’d like a constant supply of honey,” I said with a shrug. 

I watched as Quebi nodded, before drawing back. Dorien blinked for a moment, then was struck with shock as she made a chirping sound— calling back into her hive.

“Are you sure about that, Queen Quebi?” he asked, aghast.

“What’s going on?” I asked, but the \[Druid\] didn’t give an immediate answer.

Instead, I listened as a buzzing sound emerged from the cavern. I spotted a dozen worker bastion bees flying out, heeding their queen’s call. And at the very back of the group was a smaller bee— clearly a young one. But she carried something with her. An… clump of egg sacs?

I looked on as the twelve bastion bees circled around their queen, before she nodded at them. Then they flew down towards me, and I tilted my head.

“What are they doing?” I asked as they waited for me.

“She’s… giving them to you,” Dorien said slowly. He pursed his lips, turning to face me, before finally holding my gaze. He took in a deep breath and exclaimed, “She’s letting them start a new hive with you!”

And I just blinked. “Uh, what?”

I glanced back at Quebi for confirmation, and she nodded at me. She bowed her head gratefully again, before making a clicking sound with her mandibles.

“I… see.” I placed a hand on my chin as I eyed the twelve workers. “A brand new hive at my restaurant, huh?”

I did not expect that when I asked her for some honey. I was expecting her to let me regularly visit her hive to collect her honey or something— not… this. And, apparently, this was a big deal.

“Queen Quebi has refused to expand her hive for as long as I have known her,” Dorien said, eyeing the queen bastion bee with a soft gaze. “The fact that she is entrusting a new hive to you… it means she trusts you to protect them.”

She buzzed her wings, bobbing her body in agreement. I stared at her for a moment. I saw the way she looked at me— even though she was a giant bee, I could see the worry in her face. She must have been afraid. She must have been terrified, knowing that she was dying and that there was nothing she could do to save herself.

If she had perished from the poison or her wounds, her species would have truly gone extinct. That creeping fear must have been more prevalent in her mind now than ever— that was why she was giving me some of her workers to start a new hive. So that even if something were to happen to her, her people would still pervade.

I sighed. That was a lot of weight to place on my shoulders. But I just nodded as I held Quebi’s gaze.

“Yeah, I’ll protect them,” I finally said as I brought a hand up to pat the young bastion bee that was carrying the eggs. “So don’t worry about them too much.”

The queen bastion bee made a chirping sound. Once again, she bowed her head. I returned the gesture, and it almost looked like she was smiling. With that, she finally returned back to her hive as Dorien just gaped at the scene.

I waited until Quebi was finally gone, then I turned to face the twelve worker bastion bees. I pressed my lips into a thin line as I scratched the back of my head.

“Alright… now how am I supposed to bring you guys back to Wolfwater without causing a panic?”

Maybe I could convince Z to placate the village. He was an angel, so everyone would listen to him, right? 

“...where is he even at anyways?”

I still didn’t know where he disappeared to. He said he wanted to save the world or whatever. I didn’t fully trust him— but I also didn’t trust what the Voidgod said about angels, either. So I just hoped that Z wasn’t causing trouble for anyone with whatever he was doing.

—--

Guardian Angel Z357 tore through another rift. He hurriedly dispelled the Void’s essence, before flying down the tunnel to another rift. He repeated the process again. Then he did it again. And again. And again.

He had been going at it for a few hours now. Yet, the onslaught of outpouring rifts never stopped. He must have closed over a hundred of them at this point, but they kept popping up elsewhere in this intricate tunnel system.

It was getting exhausting. But the angel didn’t falter. He couldn’t falter. If he allowed these rifts to fester and foster, all of Planet 16B could be quickly overwhelmed by voidlings and voidbeasts in the matter of weeks. The situation was starting to be akin to what it was ten thousand years ago. 

No— it was even worse. While plenty of rifts had opened up back then, there weren’t nearly as many as right now. 

Or maybe the current situation wasn’t as bad as he thought. These rifts were mostly nascent in nature, after all. If one was left to fully mature, there might not have been as many other rifts opening up.

Guardian Angel Z357 didn’t fully comprehend the depths of the power of the Fal-Deus. He simply knew that it was the Void causing this incursion down here, and he had to stop it from wreaking calamity unto the world. 

He swept his gaze around the tunnel network, his twelve eyes peering through the walls as he searched for more rifts. But he paused when he saw half a dozen rifts vanishing all at once. 

They were… closing?

The rifts began to flicker and vanish as Guardian Angel Z357 narrowed his twelve eyes. He hovered in the air, carried by his wings as he looked on in confusion. He lowered his head, before blinking as the space just before him began to tear open.

He tensed, raising his lance. But this rift was larger than the others— and it formed far quicker than any other rift he had ever seen. He stopped himself from attacking just yet as he peered into the depths of the Void.

And he heard a voice.

***“Greetings… Slave of the System.”***

**Author's Notes:**

Big shoutout to Sybil by my good friend Azrie which just launched on Amazon KU today! It's a great novel, and I assure you, it has fantastic characterization and progression.

>Magic is fading, and humanity is at the brink of extinction.  
Sybil lived and breathed the life of a miner, delving deep into monster-infested caverns and perilous shafts, risking her life to unearth Relics of an ancient past for food and shelter. That is until one day, she discovers a Relic that would change her fate from a simple miner to an Ascended — a Relic that connected her to the magic that was once lost.  
\[You have acquired the aspect of Fallen Flames.\]  
A Relic that gave her freedom.

702,Was SA a commonly acceptable thing in old-school D&D? (TW - in character SA),"Hi, I am a 25F, writing this because there have been upsetting things happening at my online table (I'm a player) and I have trouble understanding the DM doing that.

We're a new group, with a single female character (I went with a male one specifically to avoid the typical in game misogyny) played by my 26F best friend. 

The way things play out it: we have both VC sessions and written roleplay stuff in between, with some parts that are public on our Discord server and some others that are private in DM. Now, with my friend, we've been keeping in touch and she's been telling me about what her female character is going through privately. 

That's how I know that the ongoing public SA she's been going through because of a gross villain (lusty stares, hands going under her dress, groping hands, dress being torn, verbal gross stuff I don't feel comfortable repeating) has reached a peak in private today as her character just got forcibly undressed and (TW) got her nipples sucked by the asshole. She kinda wrote the 50M DM into killing the villain off by just stating that her character kills him.

Okay. I have personally been really triggered
 since the 1st innuendo made by that guy and we've been talking about it in private with my friend, with her taking it more lightly than me (especially since the DM confirmed she would not get outright raped...) so I didn't want to make a scene with the DM. We've been trying to kill the villain over and over, my rogue lied saying that they were fiancés, we expressed how we hate this, but so far it's been treated as ""yeah now you hate the villains aha I'm a mean DM"". 

There are lots of things the DM does better than others, and when talking about the campaign he is really caring about what we think and operates in a ""my goal is for you to have fun"" way.

According to you, how is it possible for a DM to be considerate in every other way, but still go for actions that I know for sure would warrant many people telling us to leave the group? Is this an old-school thing? Was this acceptable decades ago? To what extent could a DM do this without, uh, thinking it's going too far?

I don't want to speak on behalf of my friend, I would rather not be too hard on the DM, especially since I have gotten some of this information by ""cheating"".

708,Best Advice.. don’t be scared to be alone,"seriously.. don’t let not being able to meet up with your group keep you from enjoying the set you intended. NO ONE IS LOOKING AT YOU! in a weird way, i prefer to choose my own destiny at coachella lol. choosing to be in the back, or in the front, and leave whenever, and see whoever, and do whatever, and eat whatever, all without wasting time waiting on others. i’m not saying fuck off by yourself the entire weekend, although i wouldn’t opposed to that… but so often (my younger self included) people would be swayed by the group and miss who they actually wanted to see. coachella is too expensive and too amazing for you to dare to not do EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT.

overheard last weekend: some girl crying in the phone bc her friends dragged her from the gorillaz set to see chemical brothers… not an entirely bad decision, but she was sobbing bc she LOVES gorillaz and didn’t know chemical brothers. this is a very easy and obvious lesson to me, do exactly as you want. peridot.",1682097892.0

715,Hot take? I think the game needs movement speed passives and a movement mastery on the tree,"Title really.

When I think of quality of life in PoE, one often overlooked aspect is ""what parts of my build can I solve via the passive tree?""

It is one of the most fun challenges in the game - trading between points either for offence, defense, or utility.

In the spirit of that, I think it would be awesome for all players (new and veteran) if we had some movement speed focused passives and masteries on the tree.

It would make relying on a specific boot roll less necessary, and for the zoomers, give them tantalizing options to choose over more damage.

Likewise, in the spirit of helping new players, the game would feel much much better in the acts with a healthy choice of move speed focused investment early on.

You can currently find move speed smattered around various passives in the tree, but nothing substantial and no mastery (you'll notice many movement clusters in the south of ranger have the ""evasion"" mastery currently)

I know plenty of people believe Robin’s reaction to be a key idea that it’s Saul, as well as him appearing to have burn scars surrounding his body. But imo she was only responding to Law. I mean, to me it looks like he’s hiding something and she noticed it, with her being Robin and all. Also, I think it’s too strange a coincidence that Saul was conveniently said to still be alive after this was revealed, making me believe Oda is trying to draw the general fandom away.

It could also be she’s curious to know seeing as she is all about knowledge.

But what’s the likelihood this person is somehow connected to Law in some way? And WHY didn’t HE chime in? For something like this I would’ve thought it would’ve been important enough for Law to form SOME dialogue.",1682103772.0

Cameron Grimes has been ready for a while, and he’s just been waiting in limbo as WWE creative comes up with a new idea for him. It seems that wait is almost over now, because Grimes is set to make his main roster debut shortly.

Zoey Stark has also been given plenty of opportunities on the main roster, like performing on Main Event. It seems that her chance on the main roster is coming sooner than later as well.",1682104304.0

So one night we were eating dinner and my girlfriend had asked me about my notifications. The notification in question was from this sub-reddit. When confronted I was completely honest and expressed that the difference between sexuality and lust but our relationship was secure. They expressed that they understood and was accepting of the situation.

Later on that night we went to a raunchy bar and there was a crazy drunk guy that talked to me and then wouldn't leave me alone. I went to the bathroom and the guy popped up again talking all kinds of sketchy stuff so I had motioned for my partner to leave. She did have a lot to drink and then lead me outside and started to say that I had a guy following me so we could hook up in the bathroom. She started a scene outside the bar and caused people to come up and tell me that I was the bad guy when she started to cry.

So I picked him up again to help him get to my car, but every single time I let go of him to stand by himself, he immediately fell back on the floor in a heap. 

After the same incident occurring ten times, I finally got him in the car and to the address he mentioned. Once out of the car and falling back down three more times. I managed to drag him to the front door and rang the doorbell.

747,Midnights in context of the break-up; the writing was already on the wall,"Hear me out, I am a writer and something I noticed is as an artist it is not uncommon to deflect and project your unconscious desires/wants/fears onto the stories/songs you write (especially when you are creating 'fictional' stories, that's why I think Folklore actually is a personal album in many ways). And then, later down the line you look back on your work and you see the warning signs, you see the red flags and now it makes sense why you wanted to write about that.

Regardless of when they broke up and what the exact reason was, I think the warning signs were there in hindsight about the relationship not being as perfect as she once described it to be. Songs about reminiscing about exes, wanting closure from an ex, the one that got away, turning her back on marriage after writing Lover (esp. Paper Rings), not feeling appreciated and seen in the relationship and wanting to sparkle and shine...Personally, something was brewing beneath the surface there.

**'The songs are not ab Joe they are ab 13 sleepless nights'.** Yeah, even if these songs are not about Joe, we repeat what we don't repair in our relationships. It is not uncommon to repeat certain patterns in your relationships with the same type of issues, we date what is familiar after all. 

That's also why I think we already got the break-up album and honestly, midnights started to make way more sense to me after the break-up! Love to hear your thoughts!",1682104880.0

750,Win/loss streaks are WAY more likely than you think!,"When people think ""what are the odds I go 5 games in a row without winning?"", most people would assume it's like any-old probability calculation: multiply the probabilities together, and you get your odds.

So, if your odds of losing are 50%, losing 5 games in a row would be 0.5^5, or 3.1%. Very unlikely, though possible. Losing 10 games in a row would be 0.5^10, or 0.097%; *incredibly* unlikely. So why do you go on so many damn loss streaks? ""Blizzard, you incompetent zoo animals, fix your game!"" you might say...

**However**, this calculation *only* applies to a streak starting *right this moment*.

What people **usually** are wondering either:

1) How likely could I go on a loss streak sometime soon?

or

2) How likely was this loss streak I just had?

Answering these questions are *very* different mathematically.  The math derivation is [a bit involved](https://www.omnicalculator.com/statistics/coin-flip-streak), but the formula is quite simple to implement, so I did coded it up in Python (and sanity checked the results with the straightforward brute-force, non-math counting algorithm).

Let's assume the probability of winning any game is 50% (i.e. you're perfectly ranked). Let's calculate, given a certain number of games played, how likely we are to experience a certain streak of losses (or wins) during it. Here are the results:

 Games/Streak| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10|
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
5 | 96.8% | 59.3% | 25.0% | 9.37% | 3.12% |  |  |  |  | 
10 | 99.9% | 85.9% | 50.7% | 24.5% | 10.9% | 4.68% | 1.95% | 0.78% | 0.29% | 0.09%
15 | 99.9% | 95.1% | 67.6% | 37.2% | 18.2% | 8.53% | 3.90% | 1.75% | 0.78% | 0.34%
20 | 99.9% | 98.3% | 78.7% | 47.8% | 24.9% | 12.2% | 5.81% | 2.72% | 1.26% | 0.58%
25 | 99.9% | 99.4% | 85.9% | 56.5% | 31.1% | 15.7% | 7.69% | 3.69% | 1.75% | 0.82%
30 | 99.9% | 99.7% | 90.7% | 63.9% | 36.8% | 19.1% | 9.53% | 4.64% | 2.23% | 1.07%
40 | 99.9% | 99.9% | 96.0% | 75.0% | 46.7% | 25.5% | 13.1% | 6.51% | 3.19% | 1.55%
50 | 99.9% | 99.9% | 98.2% | 82.7% | 55.1% | 31.4% | 16.5% | 8.35% | 4.14% | 2.03%
60 | 100.% | 99.9% | 99.2% | 88.0% | 62.2% | 36.8% | 19.8% | 10.1% | 5.08% | 2.51%
70 | 100.% | 99.9% | 99.6% | 91.7% | 68.2% | 41.8% | 22.9% | 11.9% | 6.01% | 2.99%
80 | 100.% | 99.9% | 99.8% | 94.2% | 73.2% | 46.4% | 26.0% | 13.6% | 6.93% | 3.47%
90 | 100.% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 96.0% | 77.4% | 50.7% | 28.9% | 15.3% | 7.85% | 3.94%
100 | 100.% | 99.9% | 99.9% | 97.2% | 81.0% | 54.6% | 31.7% | 17.0% | 8.75% | 4.41%

If you play 20 games, the odds of losing 5 in a row sometime during those games is **24.9%**. This is *much* higher than the 3.1% we previously calculated. If you play 50 games, the odds raise to over **55.1%**; over **half**.

And for all of you posting your 10-game loss streaks: assuming you guys have played 100 games, 4 out of every 100 people browsing this subreddit have had the exact same thing happen, likely relatively recently (if you play as much as I do). There are thousands of us browsing this sub at the moment, and 4.3 million subscribers. That means almost *200,000* of us have had a 10-game loss streak in our last 100 games.

This isn't the matchmaker's fault at all; it's statistics. We'll notice patterns that cause an emotional response from us and ignore those that aren't interesting. And every 10-game loss streak started as a 5-game, then 6-game, then 7-game, etc., furthering the emotional effect (and likely further lowering our odds of winning if we tilt).

But know that this is perfectly normal and expected. We're all going to go on a whole bunch of loss streaks, some of them incredibly long; it's essentially inevitable. *Please* stop using this as evidence the matchmaker is broken. The *only* way to accurately judge this is by analyzing the stats across the entire player base. As much as we want to, we just simply don't have the data, and are just venting.",1682089279.0

So I guess since we don’t have children and they don’t want to give her their guest room and said they have helped her enough and it’s our turn to do our part so we have to take her in and move out of our 1 bed apartment into a 2 bed apartment temporarily while they figure out where she will live. 

Well even since we took her the siblings change the story to try to find a home for her to live with us? My bf realizes this and doesn’t care that much cuz he loves his mom and she isn’t really a nuisance. I get that but I don’t want to be stuck with his mom the rest of my life.. she gossips about us to his siblings and then siblings confront us about it. Ex. Couch is kinda broken and some stains by cat vomit. Cleanliness isn’t to her standards. Me Lighting bath and body candles, she doesn’t like the smell and it’s toxic so I can’t light my candles anymore (sil called about it and told my bf how bad they are and now doesn’t want it lit) it makes me happy so I still used them. 

I really like my privacy and I like to stay home a lot and whenever I do leave she says its nice to get some fresh air I get it could be nice but I feel judged and she probably gossips about it. 

We have cats and I’m not allowed to keep the door to my bedroom closed because they scratch the door and ruin it so it’s annoying that I can never close my door and whenever she goes to the kitchen she can see what I’m doing. So can’t be naked in my room. 

Also it’s annoying that she does my bf laundry and hangs and folds it because he’s old enough to do it himself and I get it’s nice of her to do but now he thinks I don’t do anything…

But anyways it’s okay because it’s supposed to be temporary but now I think my bf thinks she can live with us forever because he was talking about us moving and said she can come with us if we want. And his siblings and the mom were supposed to be help finding her a place this past year… how do I navigate this I understand it’s messed up because it’s his mother ?",1682092949.0

771,Hit my car and take off? Have fun going back to jail.,"This takes place about a year and a half ago, but I remember it clearly.  


 I had just finished playing in the casino (native american, only  slots because card games are illegal in my state) and came out to see a  tribal police officer at the front of my car writing a report....I asked  him if it was for my car and what's going on, then he showed me the  damage.....he also told me that there was a witness (who decided not to  give a statement, and going by what the witness said, they found the  guy's truck parked near the hotel entrance and confronted him and he  denied everything......since the witness wouldn't give an official  report the officer had to put that his truck ""may"" have scraped my car  causing the damage...he had a large pickup and apparently tried to get  into the spot next to mine and wouldn't fit and clipped my car....was a  few deep scratches and paint was off one of the areas. The car in question is a 2018 Kia. I should also mention that I do gig work and nearly live in my car, at least during the day.  


So fast  forward about a week later ... I am going around and around with his  insurance carrier and they refused to pay.....keep in mind it would have  cost hundreds of dollars to get the security cam footage from the  casino parking lot because they consider that private property and  someone else handles it. I inquired about getting the footage and let's  just say it would cost quite a lot to get a court order for them to turn  the video over.  


I also had his full name from the initial  report so I got on google, and this is the first link comes back...and  it's his friggin MUGSHOT.

  
Apparently   he had been arrested a few months earlier for a probation (parole?) violation.....so i do some detective work and make a couple calls...I ended up finding out who is PO was and gave him a call....come to find out that not only does he have a current warrant out for his arrest, but he had no business being at the casino because going there was a violation of his probation/parole....I never heard anything more about it but I know he's in deep shit because that accident report proves he was there.  
Side note: I found out from his PO that he was required to check in with him on a daily basis, and he hadn't been doing so.   
So even though I had to eat the repair costs that totalled $1500, I feel I did get some petty revenge on him because it's obvious that new charges would have been filed against him for violating his parole once again. I've googled his name somewhat recently and haven't seen anything about him being arrested again so I'm sure he's on the lamb hiding out because he knows full well he'll be going back to prison to serve his full term for repeatedly violating the terms of his release.

775,Re-UPDATED: all new TOTK stuff map,"Hey all.  Now that we’re 3 weeks out (!!) I thought I’d share an updated map with all the new stuff we’ve seen from gameplay footage and the final trailer (no leaks or spoilers). Again, big shoutout to YouTube channels like Zeltik and the Looygi Bros. who have pointed out many of these locations. This map is really just a compilation of the hard work of many others. My map and editing skills aren’t the best, but I think it’ll suffice for now. 

Quick caveat that while this represents the content we have seen so far it may not represent the actual map at all one time during the game. We’ve seen a lot of inconsistencies in the footage so far - sometimes there’s a tower and sometimes not, glyphs disappear, and labyrinths are sometimes floating. So keep in mind that any of this could be wrong. But do let me know what I’ve missed!!

Updates include:
- the starting sky islands; This is a big one! and all due to redditers like Teo_Many, kokirytheory, zeytekk, and Mr_JBCA who were able to map, project, and scale accurately. 
- new glyph, tower, malice hole, swirl, structure, and sinkholes in Gerudo
- new malice on the Great Plateau (2), Lake Hylia, Kakariko, Outpost Ruins, and Lanaryu Wetlands

Previous updates included removing lava around Death Mountain, removing the shroud around Zonai Ruins, and removing the labyrinths.",1682088569.0

The Ontario government has released its exciting vision for the redevelopment of Ontario Place into a world-class, year-round destination.

We're bringing more to Ontario Place with more beaches, more greenspace, more trails and more fun with the Ontario Science Centre, a year-round Live Nation concert venue and expanded food and beverage offerings.

The Ontario Science Centre will find its new home in a custom-built, state-of-the-art facility, as well as in the preserved and upgraded iconic Cinesphere and Pod complex. It will bring exciting science-based educational programming to the heart of Ontario Place, sparking curiosity and innovation for a new generation of visitors, while inspiring young people towards the jobs of the future.

The province is also finalizing an agreement with Live Nation that will create a new, year-round concert venue attraction. Building on 25 years of memories, the brand-new amphitheater will welcome 20,000 fans to an all-season venue, increasing its capacity, while also protecting its beloved grassy amphitheater.

We're also engaging with the market about opportunities for a new and improved public marina at Ontario Place, which will include retail, dining and family-friendly activities, making it a place where people can socialize, grab a meal and enjoy the water, year-round.

Once complete, Ontario Place will create thousands of new jobs and attract an estimated four to six million visitors each year.

Together with our partners, we're building an iconic space that's fun for families, students and tourists to enjoy for generations to come.

We hope you found this information helpful. Thank you again for reaching out to our office and we will ensure your concerns are shared with MPP Peter Bethlenfalvy. If you have any other comments or concerns, please feel free to contact us at 905-509-0336.",1682101365.0
791,"Why Book of Mormon Geography is a Big, Made-Up Fantasy","&#x200B;

When you first read the Book of Mormon, the geography seems obvious.  You have a land northward and a land southward, surrounded by oceans, connected to each other by a narrow neck of land, the width of which can be traversed from the sea east o the sea west in a day and a half.  Sounds like North America, South America, and the narrow neck being Panama, right?

That works until you get into the story itself and realize it couldn’t have taken place over thousands of square miles, but only hundreds at most.  Obviously when King Limhi’s party set out for Zarahemla, accidently ended up in the land northward and found the records of the Jaredites, they wouldn’t have traveled thousands of miles in the wrong direction before realizing they had gone the wrong way.  And at the end of the Book of Mormon it definitely does not sound like the hill Cumorah is thousands of miles away from the narrow neck of land.

LDS scholars recognized these problems a long time ago, and, in the late 20th century, came up with the limited Mesoamerican geography model.  In this scenario, the land northward was central Mexico, the narrow neck of land was the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the land southward was eastern Mexico and most of Central America.  So influential has the work of these scholars been, that it is virtually accepted among many church members that this is where the Book of Mormon took place, people proposing where different Book of Mormon cities were located and sponsoring tours of “Book of Mormon Lands.”

What so many church members don’t realize, however, is that all of this is pure speculation, based on no solid proof, with a lot of solid reasons to believe otherwise.

First of all, let’s be clear—There have been no inscriptions discovered in the region mentioning any people, places, or events in the Book of Mormon, nor are there any archeological artifacts that can be definitively connected to the Book of Mormon either.

Secondly, the geography outlined in the Book of Mormon doesn’t even fit the geography of the region.  The Isthmus of Tehuantepec, at 124 miles across, could hardly be traversed from one side to the other in a day and a half on foot like the narrow neck of land in the Book of Mormon.  Additionally, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec spans from north to south, not from the sea east to the sea west like the one in the Book of Mormon. 

This brings us to our next problem.  The whole of Mesoamerica runs more west to east, than north to south.  So that means when the Book of Mormon says the land northward it really would have to mean the land westward, and when it says the land southward, it would really have to mean the land eastward, so basically you have to tilt all the Book of Mormon directions 70 to 80 degrees to the left to make it all work.  

On top of that, you now have to have two Cumorahs, one in Mexico, where the final Book of Mormon battle took place and where Mormon hid up all the records, and the second one in New York, to which Moroni hauled his heavy book of plates thousands of miles so Joseph Smith could find them.  This, of course, goes against decades of Church teaching that the hill in New York was the same hill where all Cumorah events mentioned in the Book of Mormon took place.

To get around the two Cumorah problem, other Book of Mormon enthusiasts have proposed a third theory, that the whole of the Book of Mormon took place in North America.  This theory is so at odds with the geography outlined in the Book of Mormon that I really don’t think it’s worth wasting my time on.

In my view, what happened is Joseph Smith intended for the Book of Mormon to take place in the whole of North and South America and for Panama to be the narrow neck of land.  He just didn’t think through the logistics of making the story fit the geography, and, as a result, created a conundrum his followers have been trying to make sense of ever since.",1682082143.0

We ran into each other for the first time playing Rocket League and partied up because we meshed well together. We won our fair share of games and then went our separate ways. About a month later, we ran into each other again by chance playing hoops. This time I decided to take a chance and invite him to my party on xbox while we were playing and I kept thinking, ""please don't be a squeaker."" Turns out, we were right around the same age, had a lot in common and we instantly vibed. From then on, a friendship and brotherhood was born. Over the years we would talk about finally meeting each other and hanging out for real but nothing came to fruition. Until very recently...
For my birthday, my girlfriend got in touch with him and managed to get him to come down and surprise me at work. She had me guessing all day but I never would have imagined that he would be standing in front of me. This is the first time we met face to face and it brings a smile to my face everytime.

FRC is due to release their earnings on April 24th. That means you degenerates have less than 48 hours to get in FRC on the ground floor before earnings come out on April 24th. 

I posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public (I'll post it in the comments too). I still get dozens of messages every day asking if I changed my opinion and if I've sold. No, I have not. I have not changed my stance one inch and neither have I sold a single share of FRC even though as of today I'm in the money and can walk away with a nice little profit. But I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? 🚀🚀🚀

Everything I wrote in that piece is as true today as when it was written, if not truer. Fear is in the air, blood is on the streets, and uncertainty reigns. The hedges and media friend’s attacks on FRC and regional banks have continued, though it's getting a little old by now. However, the sentiment is still unbelievably negative and fear driven. The expectation is that FRC is royalty fucked, that this thing is nanometers away from failure and total bankruptcy. That is baked into the price. But we've already seen that regional banks' numbers are fairly [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12t7ilq/the_average_deposits_of_regional_banks_in_q1/). This news hasn't had time to propagate through the market just yet, but it will soon. 

Come April 24th, we will find out one of two things: Either FRC is as royally fucked as everyone expects, in which case everyone shrugs and says ""knew it"" (the price might still go down a bit), or FRC turns out better than expected, in which case absolute pandemonium ensures. The range for this second scenario can be ""FRC's situation a little bit better than expected"" or ""god damn this thing is actually doing really well!"" or anywhere between. Read my analysis then take a nice, careful look at the below graph and tell me which scenario you think will happen:

Context: In a game that featured two ejections, one near-miss groin kick, and more than anyone's fair share of pushing and shoving, the overt physical tone of Game 3 of Sixers/Nets was evident from the jump. Asked if he had ever witnessed chaotic scenes akin to those on display at the Barclays Center last night, Sixers coach Doc Rivers responded, ""Yeah. I played for the Knicks.""

835,[Chapter 1081],"„Only weakling lose their way""

Just because of this sentence I am 99% convinced that garp will no longer tell luffy to become a navy soldier. Luffy has been saying he wants to be the pirate king since the very beginning and never ever had any doubt about becoming the pirate king. He knows what he wants and never lost his way. And he already got so far by beating a yonko and got the title of yonko. 

If luffy suddenly decides to become a navy soldier, and that's a very big „if"", I guess garp would see him as a weakling for losing his way. 

Although luffy didn't follow his path he is surely proud of his grandson.",1682085680.0
836,Free F1 Viewing! Come volunteer!,"People don’t seem to know this, but if you’ve got time and energy, anyone can get free tickets to the best seats on the track.

See those guys in Orange and Red overalls everywhere at a race, waving flags, sweeping the track and keeping the crowd back? They’re all volunteers, and it costs nothing but your time to join the team and have the best F1 experience!

There’s no cash involved, but there’s usually free tickets for friends and family, and often exclusive event Merch available for everyone who helps out at Grand Prix weekends. The only drawback is often inhospitable hours (5am starts and 9pm finishes) but it’s well worth it. You can get involved in the game, meet some genuinely legendary folks who love the racing as much as you, and get up-close and personal to the cars, the drivers and the action. I’ve volunteered a couple of times now, and I’ve met Checo, Logan, De Vries, Bottas and several of the F2 drivers (You’re not going to get their autograph though. That’s usually frowned on).

Often, all it takes is an online short course (max 1 hour) to get you’re officiating license and sign up to help out. Then all you need to do is turn up and help out.

Don’t stop there either! Go to your local formula races (Formula Ford, Formula Vee, F5000 etc.), drift events, rally, your local circuit, anywhere, because we’re always willing to have people who love the sport as much as we do and are keen to help out.

Over the last two years, I’ve volunteered at an F1 Grand Prix, a Word Rally Championship Race, a Classic F1 Race, drift carnivals, Autocross and Rally Events and it’s never not fun.

TL;DR come volunteer and get free tickets

Here’s a [link](https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/formula-1-marshals-who-are-they-what-they-do-do-they-get-paid/6526567/) with more information.

EDIT: I will add a disclaimer. I’ve only been to the Australian Grand Prix. The process will differ between each country, but I recommend checking out their website. Head to the “Volunteer” section and find out.

EDIT: A lot of y’all are hung up on this idea of volunteering. If you don’t want the job, don’t take it lol. There’s nothing wrong with having some fun lmao.",1682079535.0

842,I can't do this anymore,"I am mentally checked out. I really cannot handle this anymore. These Christo-fascist Nazis who hate LGBTQIA+ people are trying their damnedest to turn America into a white ethno-religious state. Every bill they create is a bill designed to dehumanize and strip the rights from anyone they deem to be a threat to their Christian fascist empire. 

Texas just passed two bills requiring all schools to display the Ten Commandments and have designated prayer times, a blatant bald faced violation of the First Amendment. Tennessee just made it illegal for trans or gender non-conforming people to dress in a way that ""opposes"" their assigned sex.

Oh I almost forgot, assigning people to hunt down said minority, which Mississippi and Tennessee have done, with their whistle-blower programs that pay out monetary rewards to anyone who reports someone they ""suspect"" of being trans or queer.

The American flag used to stand for something greater. Now when I see it, all I feel is despair and disgust at what my country has become. What it is becoming.

How long before the right disarms us? Fox News and its ilk have been using the shooting in Tennessee as justification for demonizing trans people further. The shooter who identified as nonbinary as well, and the one who was gay. You think they won't attempt to disarm LGBTQIA+ people? The more defenseless we become, the easier it is to erase us. They take away the minority's right to bear arms, then they force identification (they're already well on the way to that, with several states now forcing genital examinations on students and forcing students to prove their gender identity) then they isolate you. This genocide is real and they are not pretending to hide it anymore.

Pride is stronger than before, but this also means stronger pushback by these power-hungering individuals who have nothing to offer to better people’s life, they want power, so what’s the strategy? Fabricating problems, targeting someone as the cause of said problems as their goal to be brought to power.

This is and always has been about erasing *anyone* who does not conform to Christianity. The LGBTQIA+ community is just the start and the easiest target because we are the least represented, the least protected, and the smallest minority, and therefore the easiest to genocide.

852,Genshin is in a dire need of a glossary (Minor Spoilers),"The farther we get into the story, the more confusing it is, especially with all the synonyms and multiple names for everything. I read all the quest text and some things only make sense to me after I 100% a whole region and then read up on it online.

I barely understood that Al-Ahmar and Deshret were the same person. I thought Al-Ahmar was some kind of city in the desert region. I needed until the Dirge of Bilqis quests to understand that, and now we even have Amun. Then we got about a dozen of other names. Parvezravan, Liloupar, Ormazd and who knows what.

That's the easier part tho. The hardest part are the different terminologies different factions in the game use. For example, if you missed that one line where it is translated that Dev means Hilichurls and Dahri means Khaneriah, you will literally need to solve a whole lore riddle to understand you are located literally on Khaenrian ruins at certain points in the game.

I had to literally google Amurta (after literally finishing the quests) to know that it was the remains of the dead Hydro archon in the new quests.

Just a glossary of the important stuff would do wonders for the story of this game.  


EDIT: To clarify, I did read during the main quests when Sumeru started that Deshret/Al-Ahmar/The Scarlet King were the same person, but it got lost among the other 100 things you need to pay attention to, and by the time I got to the desert I already forgot. To me by then Scarlet King and Al-Ahmar were two different things, when in reality Al-Ahmar MEANS The Scarlet King.",1682090587.0

We understood why you didn't want another Luna/NF situation but we begged for at least a cosmetic reward. On the very same week those of us who made it to Ascendent got our cosmetic ""reward"", this latest exploit makes the emblem obsolete.

I was proud of rocking the emblem (that I earned) and now I'll probably never wear it again. I personally know people who have already cheesed the exploit to get out of Gold into Ascendant in one day. It's an absolute shame.

This will get tons of downvotes & negative comments from both PVEers (who don't understand PVP) & players who have abused the exploit but it needs to be said. This trivilization of the only reward we had to grind to Ascendant is likely the final nail in the coffin for this mode. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to play it anymore. People are already gleefully stating they don't care if they get banned from Comp (for using the exploit) because they are never playing the mode again after getting the emblem.

Rant over, feel free to respond how yall wish. I don't care enough to respond anymore to any of it. (Just need Bungie to know why the mode is done).",1682083059.0

I've always wondered who sings for the queens: the finale songs, the pre-recorded rusicals, the *amazing* Carol Channing impression. And the fandom has discussed it in the past, but always about specific songs.

So I set out to fix that. I've documented every time a playback track has been used on an English-language edition of the show, and I've worked backwards and forwards to consolidate and compare as much as I can, all the way back to S3. I have identified **40 different people** who have contributed to pre-recorded tracks, and I've learned a lot about some of them... but there's so much more to do!

So **I need your help**! As you can see, there are a lot of blanks on my list, and a lot of uncertainty, too. If you have any information or know where to find something, please let me know in the comments!

Beyond that, it might interest you to know that **three singers are head-and-shoulders above the rest**:

###Christina Bianco: The Master Impressionist

New Yorkers will recognize Christina from that city's cabaret scene, [where she's know for her rapidfire celebrity impressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enygyo3ucY0), and that's exactly what she does on Drag Race: Ms. Bianco has only appeared on 4 episodes, but she has done **17 unique performances**, covering 16 different celebrities. (Her Dolly Parton's so nice Ru had it twice.) In her heaviest single-episode lift, [she did *all* the voices for the AS3 Divas Live challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FXouan33k4).

###Kooks Leonard: The ""It"" Girl

**Nobody has done as many breakout roles** as Katharine ""Kooks"" Leonard: you'll recognize her distinctive, Broadway-ready voice in roles like [Preacher Teacher in *Wigloose*](https://youtu.be/duqm1uiSXmY?t=39), [Kris Jenner in the Kardashians rusical](https://youtu.be/ekT97aLovPc?t=111), and [Saltine in *Moulin Ru*](https://youtu.be/n9P09vydOMI?t=205). Kooks has likely been with the show for a decade (she was one of [the OG sugar babies](https://youtu.be/Vn6C6zRoM2Q?t=12)), and has contributed to **7 different episodes**, as well as the Vegas soundtrack. [You might also have seen her in the OBCs of *Footloose* and *Hairspray*](https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/katharine-leonard-69561)!

###Myah Marie: All Hail the Queen

Whether or not you've heard of her, you definitely know Myah Marie Langston's voice from her contributions as a backup singer for acts like Lil Wayne, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Erika Jayne. But it's her collabs with Britney Spears, including singing several demo tracks and allegedly pitching in a few leads in the *Britney Jean* era, that have made her most famous. Marie's hyperfemme pop-princess vocals will be super familiar to Drag Race fans from roles like [Eve in *Herstory of the World*](https://youtu.be/hjIwge5zqxY?t=16), [Britney Spears in the Kardashian rusical](https://youtu.be/ekT97aLovPc?t=38), and [""Legs"" from the S8 finale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzNFKw1a12s). Most controversially of all, [**that's Myah Marie doing ""when the oxygen masks drop down""** in Glamazonian Airways](https://youtu.be/nanmCkNSQdo?t=114). (Not Allie X, as a lot of people believe!)

And no shade to anybody else, but Myah Marie is the true queen of the playback singers: **8 episodes plus Vegas**, in the game for **11 years** (all the way back to the Fabulous Bitch Ball on S4!), and **18 unique roles**. Sure, they all sound kinda like Britney, but how can you be mad with excellence?

###Honourable Mentions

* Mary Birdsong (7 roles, 3 episodes, 2 seasons)
* Vonzell Solomon (6 roles, 5 episodes, 4 seasons)
* Leland (7 roles, 6 episodes, 6 seasons)
* April Malina (5-8 roles, 4 episodes, 4 seasons, and probably a lot more I just haven't been able to find!)

###Other Interesting Stats

* Only 2 performers have done the same queen twice: Myah Marie for Naomi Smalls (Bitch Perfect + Legs) and Vincint for Luxx Noir London (Wigloose + It's Giving Fashion).
* As it turns out, Canada and the UK have only ever done rusicals with live singing. The Americans have it easy!",1682082597.0

>Good morning, Secretary Yellen. I want to thank the Council, the staff, and you for developing today’s guidance on non-bank determinations, which I am pleased to support.  
>  
>History is replete with times when tremors in one corner of the financial system or at one financial institution spill out into the broader economy.

>Such risks can originate from the banking sector. The events of the last six weeks are yet another reminder of this. Such risks, though, also can originate from outside of the banking sector.  
>  
>Early in my public service career—25 years ago in fact, when I was serving at the U.S. Department of the Treasury—I witnessed up close such an event.  
>  
>**I was asked by then-Secretary Rubin to fly up to Connecticut on a fateful weekend to visit the highly levered hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), which was about to fail. Subsequently, I was asked to staff the President’s Working Group review of the matter. We found that the event “highlighted the risks of excessive leverage, and the possibility that problems at one financial institution could potentially pose risks to the financial system as a whole.”**[\[1\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-fsoc-042123#_ftn1)  
>  
>The 2008 financial crisis, much greater in magnitude, was yet again an example of systemic risk emanating out from both the banking and non-bank sectors alike. Lest we forget, millions of people lost their jobs and small businesses had to shutter.  
>  
>In response, Congress set up this interagency council, tasked with important authorities and mandates to better guard against systemic risk. Recognizing that risk from both banks and non-bank financial companies can emanate throughout the economy to everyday Americans, Congress tasked this Council to designate which non-bank financial entities were systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Such designation would subject them to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve.  
>  
>I was honored, nearly 13 years ago, to serve on the first Council, including when we considered and later approved in 2012 the initial rule implementing these procedures.  
>  
>As I said when we approved that rule: “Effective regulation of systemically important nonbank financial entities is essential to preventing risk from such entities from spreading to the U.S. economy. … This rule helps protect taxpayers from picking up the bill for such a financial entity’s failure.”[\[2\]](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-fsoc-042123#_ftn2)  
>  
>I’m pleased to support today’s recommendation, which would reinvigorate this Council’s designation process—in line with Congress’s vision for our work.  
>  
>As important as today’s step is, I believe each of our agencies have important roles within our respective authorities to enhance the resiliency of the financial system. At the SEC, we’re working along with fellow Council members to do just that—enhancing the resiliency of the U.S. Treasury markets, money market funds, open-end funds, private funds, clearinghouses, dealers, and with regard to cybersecurity. We also adopted a rule to shorten the settlement cycle in securities markets in half.  
>  
>**Lest we forget the risks posed by the near-collapse of LTCM in 1998, we also must build upon the work of the Hedge Fund Working Group. That means looking at large, interconnected, highly-levered hedge funds, the associated repo markets for financing, the prevalence of low to zero haircuts in such funding, and the extension of leverage from banks and prime brokers.**  
>  
>Those events 25 years ago also impressed this upon me: Though we’re never going to get rid of risk in the system, we must best identify, manage, and guard against such risk to protect the American public.  
>  
>Today’s guidance is a step towards doing that, helping us better protect people’s jobs, livelihoods, and trust in our financial system.

And this is not me campaigning, I'm dead serious. And I said it kind of yesterday before, I wish I had set it louder: But if we're going to start punishing the retaliators and not the instigators, then we got a problem in this league.

And as a coach, and I love Jacque, but I can't believe we have coaches campaigning for guys not playing. That's just nuts to me. I've been a player and this is a player's league and I am 100 percent pro-player. I think players should play in games. We talk all year about fans being unhappy about guys playing and now we're taking guys out of the playoffs. I don't believe in the past stuff either. They take away all your techs at the end of the season and you start over, then you should start over with that stuff too. Joe [Dumars] was saying with Draymond, the past. No, you should have done something then. This is now.

But on top of that, Draymond Green stepped on a guy's chest because he was holding his foot. The instigator was holding his foot. If I was at a park, and I'm gonna make this point, and you stood over me, we're gonna have a problem. I didn't grow up in the sticks and stones era, I grew up in the breaking bones area. So, it's little different. But these guys they know they can do it because they know you can most likely you can't do anything. I'm not picking on Claxton, but I don't think in a park, you're standing over Joel. But when you got the refs and everybody else there, you know nothing's going to happen. This is what I'm concerned by: Teams targeting the better players with instigation to get them thrown out, and the better player has to be above and can't retaliate.""",1682107765.0

The previous two fiscals years  we had 'record profits' and met or exceeded % profit goals.. The last CEO whom I thought was decent, continued to ensure us there throughout that time that no layoffs were being done and we remained strong. He decided to move on from the company for personal reasons.

The new CEO seemed like a good fit, good background, good portfolio, and actually had experience with our related business. First company announcement was for Employee Appreciation day we were given.. a half day... Yipeee.

Then the next message a few weeks later is this. ""The company is having a bad year and business is slow so we have to company-wide layoffs' Im paraphrasing but that is basically it.

This is a bit of a shock to me. My team/dept is supposed to be hiring right now. I have been waiting for months already for a position/role to be filled to alongside my work to support the ridiculous amount of work and projects being thrown at me. The last I heard from my Superiors was that we were still actively trying to hire for this position. And now I hear there is 'company-wide' layoffs? WTF. Its a big company so I dont know which dept or how many. But in my areas, there is already too much work, too little time spread between not enough people. So the idea of reducing work-force scares me even further.

Just dont understand how having 2 incredible years of profits and then one of not so good profits means having to remove a chunk of the workforce. What if it was those people being laid off that helped generate the 2 previous years of record profits? They even stated part of the reason was because of competitors going after our market and offering better prices. Sooo that means there was technically nothing wrong with our business model being successful for years, just that this year has competitors who have been known to take short-term losses to steal clients and disrupt our business. Even though we have some clients who come back after they realized the competitor couldnt do what we do, and promised and underdelivered.

Just hate that new CEO comes in and in a month the first plan is to slash resources. Workers.

Rant Off

Takeaways? Don't trust new CEOs. and Dont believe that having record profits means anything for your job security.

Edit: Question for you all. If I want to demand to know which dept had layoffs and how many, how should I ask for this information? Because I want to *demand* to know at least the % of them.",1682087412.0

888,"TIL that without Rick Rude, Paul Bearer and the Undertaker may have not happened.","Credit to “The Signature Spot” on Facebook, where I copied this from.


Percy Pringle (Paul Bearer) shares a story of how just days before Christmas in 1990, his car was repossessed, and he was on the verge of bankruptcy until a call to Rick Rude changed his fate:

""It was four days before Christmas, in Dallas, Texas. World Class Championship Wrestling had closed down a couple of years before, and The USWA was ready to move back to Tennessee to make room for the new Global Wrestling Federation at The Sportatorium.

I found myself without a job, and on the verge of bankruptcy. My car had been repossessed, and we didn’t have the money for a Christmas tree, much less presents to put under one. It became painfully hard to look into the eyes of my ten-year old and three-year old sons. I knew in my heart that my wrestling career was over, and it was time to make a drastic change.

I called my friend “Ravishing” Rick Rude, who was working for The WWF at the time. I told Rick exactly what was going on in my life, and that I planned on moving back home to Alabama and go back to work in the funeral industry. He was very sympathetic, and asked me not to make any quick decisions. In fact, Rick told me that he would call me back before the end of the day.

When we talked again a couple of hours later, he said “Vince wants you to call him at home.” I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Now, let me know what he has to say.” Rick concluded. I immediately fell back onto the sofa, dropping Vince McMahon’s telephone number to the floor. After about twenty minutes, I finally realized that it wasn’t a dream, and gathered the strength to dial Mr. McMahon’s private home number.

“Where have you been all these years?” I remember Vince asking me, and after some small talk he told me that he would certainly like to meet with me after the holidays. The conversation still didn’t solve my Christmas problems, but I did have a sleepless night thinking that I may finally make it to “The Fed”.

Early the next morning, my phone rang, and it was Mr. McMahon’s right hand man, Pat Patterson. Pat wanted to know if I could catch an early afternoon flight to New York, because Vince wanted to see me sooner than expected. Of course, my answer was positive, and he provided the flight information I needed. Things were happening so quickly, I could hardly digest them.

Darkness was falling over the New York skyline as my American Airlines jet made it’s way into John F. Kennedy Airport. As I walked down the jet way, I spotted a well-dressed gentleman holding a card with my name written across it. I identified myself; he took my bag and told me to follow him to my limousine. “Limousine! Hell, I don’t even own a car.” I thought to myself.

I actually felt like I was one of the Beverly Hillbillies as the limo driver took me through New York City and into Connecticut. Finally, we arrived at a majestic five-star hotel in Stamford, where I was whisked away to my penthouse suite. I wasn’t in the room five-minutes before my phone rang, and it was Pat Patterson. “Percy, Vince want to see you at 10 o’clock in the morning.” Pat told me, “I’ll pick you up at 9:45. In the meantime, you can eat, drink, and do anything you want to do. Just sign your name, it’s all courtesy of Titan Sports.""

To say that I was nervous is an understatement. I was scared to death, as I entered Vince McMahon’s office the next morning. Which, by the way, was my wedding anniversary, December 22, 1990.

We talked about everything under the sun. It didn’t take long for Vince to make me feel right at home. As he looked over my resume, he began to laugh. I didn’t have a clue what was going on. “You have a degree in Mortuary Science?” Mr. McMahon questioned me, “This is just too much.” Little did I know that they were looking for a manger for The Undertaker, and Vince wasn’t aware that I had a background in Funeral Service, as well as being a wrestling manager. It was a match made in heaven, and when I left Titan Towers, I had a WWF contract in hand.

We made it through the holidays; the WWF contract was a suitable anniversary gift for Dianna and myself. I went on the road in January 1991, as The WWF character known as Paul Bearer, managing The Undertaker.""",1682076222.0

They must be trolling to get a reaction!!!"" But I think this is a copium excuse to just ignore opposing opinions a lot of the time.

For example: there's someone here who likes to yell at me about how I'm evil and love misinterpreting tumblr posts and then they proceed to give the most rancid takes on what said tumblr posts actually mean (dw they're ""totally not stalking/harassing me"", they just ""happen to come across my comments"" and coincidentally the only comments they ""come across"" are the ones they would didagree with.)

Even with these people, I wouldn't leap to the assumption that they're ""trolls"", I just assume that they're stupid and have some serious issues, but I think they genuinely believe their shit takes and aren't merely putting on a show to get a rise out of me (which as I understand, is the point of trolling).

896,WON: Some AEW Notes and News,"From the recent topic [Wrestling Observer Newsletter](https://www.f4wonline.com/newsletters/wrestling-observer-newsletter/april-24-2023-observer-newsletter-cm-punk-scheduled-to-return-to-aew-big-event-updates)

•  **Update on All-Out**: While AEW has not made an announcement or officially responded regarding if there will be an All Out, there are people who work in AEW who have privately told people on social media saying All Out will be a week after All In. This is not confirmed by anyone in AEW who have been quiet about that subject. When Dave asked people in AEW about whether there will be an All Out PPV show, he’s gotten no answer so officially there’s no answer to that question.

• **The Elite and BCC status after the brand split:** Dave noted that the Elite and BCC will remain the top attractions on the Wednesday Dynamite show.

• **Details on Komander signing with AEW + WWE's interest:** Dave noted that WWE had significant interest in Komander, but he ended up in AEW just like Jay White. He noted that Komander signing with AEW made sense because AEW generally offers far more to guys of that level as WWE would be expected to put him on an NXT deal with the idea that if you do make the main roster you’ll get good money, and there’s no guarantee of that main roster, and probably not for years. Dragon Lee was going on the idea he’d be main roster in one year and then start making $250,000 or more, and time will tell how that plays out, but he’ll probably get more in-ring time and television in NXT.

• **Injury update on Matt Jackson**: Matt Jackson did far more than anyone expected including a series of Northern lights suplexes on the floor in the brawl on Dynamite this week. He was doing both PRP and stem cell treatments on the arm and the doctors said how great it was looking so quickly after the injury. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy uses injections of a concentration of a patient’s own platelets to accelerate the healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles and joints",1682079390.0
897,"Kyrie after leaving LeBron; 2018 (injured, missed playoffs), 2019 (2nd rd loss to Bucks, played terribly), 2020 (injured, missed playoffs), 2021 (injured in 2nd round loss to Bucks), 2022 (1st rd sweep by Celtics, played terribly), 2023 (missed play-in). In short, an utter failure.","In the 6 seasons since Kyrie left LeBron's shadow, Kyrie:

- Joined a team that made the 2017 ECF, who then made 2018 ECF again with him hurt, made them worse and bounce out in 2019 2nd round, who then made 2020 ECF again after he left. In 2 seasons, he played 127 regular season games, and only had 1 series win with Celtics.

- Left in FA and joined a team that handed him the key to the franchise. He got KD, DeAndre Jordan, Harden, got Kenny Atkinson replaced by Steve Nash. And in 3 seasons, he played 143 regular season games, and only had 1 series win (vs an injured Celtics missing Brown and Timelord).

- Forced his way off the Nets and got traded to the Mavs. Mavs were around 4-5 seed when he got there, and they finished the season as 11th seed and missed the play-in in embarrassing fashion. Admittedly, Kyrie actually played well for them, despite them losing.

I never had an issue with a great player like Kyrie wanting out of a greater player's shadow to forge his own legacy. Kobe did it. Scottie maybe should have done it. Jaylen Brown might do it. It is what it is.

But considering how many talented teams Kyrie has been on since he left LeBron, he has been an utter failure when it comes to the playoffs, partly due to his injuries. 2 playoff series wins in 6 seasons. 

And I haven't even mentioned any of his off-court disasters such as his antivax bullshit, the antisemitic movie post, Alex Jones, etc...

An utter failure, but he got paid, and he's about to get a big, guaranteed bag by a desperate Mavs because they're worried Luka might leave.",1682095173.0

I recently stumbled upon an article from Notorious magazine that had this snippet about him which I found pretty interesting. This was when he was going as ""The Artist"" so when they say ""The Artist"" they are referring to Prince.

[Magazine cover](https://i.imgur.com/0UQyo3O.png)

[Relevant snippet](https://i.imgur.com/ptlOH02.jpg)

> The Artist is a basketball fanatic, so inside the room where his band rehearses every day, a net and backboard are mounted on the wall; he's known to take on all comers. **(Once, during a concert in Montreal, the Chicago Bulls were in game three of the playoffs and he was watching the game from a TV at the side of the stage while he played guitar solos. He had his wardrobe girl draw up big cards and flash the score at him.)**
