1,I’m 16 and my mother died last night.,"It’s still under investigation to determine a concrete decision if her death was accidental or deemed a suicide attempt ( I should know by later this morning). She was found in the gultch behind my house at around 6:30 pm, but it’s believed the incident happened a little after 12:30 pm shortly after my dad left home. My dad came home after doing shopping at 3:30 pm and didn’t see my mom in the house.

This wasn’t alarming as her shoes were gone and my mom liked to take frequent walks to clear her head. She was really anxious for the past month, in part of her fathers Alzheimer’s and work and marital problems with my dad. My dad got more anxious as time went on and at 4:30 tried to go out and find her, thinking maybe she got lost. After returning him and my grandmother checked all the closets and small spaces in my home as my mother has a past with depression and suicide (in 7th grade she cut her arm, cutting open the vein). My dad finally decided to go into the gultch behind our house and that’s where he found her, already deceased. 

I was out with my boyfriend at the time and got a call at 6:41 pm from my father to come home. Which started the long journey of emotions and disbelief when I came home to fire trucks, the ambulance and police cars everywhere. I’m still in disbelief and it still doesn’t feel real. I’m not sure what to do. I’m in my senior year of High school and I myself have dealt with depression and have been on medication for 2 years. I also have a history with an eating disorder that I went to a clinic and got treated at 2 years ago. I don’t want to fall into these habits again but I want to so bad at the same time. I’ve never had to cope with something like this and I’m so lost. 

I’m sorry if there is any mistakes I didn’t read it over.

(Edit: got the results, my father didn’t want to tell me she had a gun, but they found a bullet. She shot herself.)",1573317650.0
2,My ex-friend is a serialkiller,"I really don’t know what to say. He’s not the person i knew at all, we were really good friends for a year, we almost saw each other each week,  and he was such a sweet, kinda awkward guy. The last conversation we had was january last year, and i hadn’t heard from him since then. February last year he killed his first victim, he has killed 3 people, and was described as one by news. He previously (before i knew him) was convicted of attempted manslaughter and rape, he had gotten out a year before i met him, and he never told me any of this. I really have no idea how to cope with this, and i already have problems with thinking things aren’t real, and have previously gone into psychosis because of this, and this whole thing makes me really scared. I really have no idea what to do or how to react.",1592165785.0
3,My girlfriend committed suicide,"We dated for 2 and a half years. I went of to college out of state to better provide for her. We had plans. We wanted kids. I was going to speed through my degree so that I could provide for her while she was in college. We wanted a cozy little apartment downtown, a Labrador, and to be happy for the rest of our lives. But that cant happen now. Nothing can happen now. 

She had a history of mental illness. She struggled with depression her whole life and I just wanted to be there for her. Her parents where toxic, and she was adopted. They devalued her constantly and I think that was a big part of it. But I should've been there. I know I cant blame myself, but if I called more, talked to her more, stayed in state,or a thousand other things maybe shed still be here. 

The worst part is I feel empty. I've known for over 24 hours. Few tears, only really physical responses. I've closed off, and can't even bring myself to eat or do anything I enjoy. I want to, but I physically can't.  I feel so hollow, and whatever is left inside feels like it's being torn out as the hours go by. But I emotionally don't feel. She's gone. I'll never see her again. I'll never be able to feel her against my chest as we sleep, never be able to see her eyes brighten up when I came around. Never be able to sit around doing nothing yet be the happiest a person can be. Never listen to her play music, watching the beauty of it all. She's gone. But I'm still here and she won't ever be again. She won't ever go on about how they spelled her name st the coffee shop. She'll never steal my phone and take dozens of pictures while I'm not looking. She'll never do anything. Why can't I feel? Why doesn't it seem real. Why didn't they tell me sooner? She died Friday and no one told me until my dad called yesterday while I was at work. Why",1574403244.0
4,We lost our unborn baby about a year ago and I still feel anger inside me,"My wife and I were due to have a baby in December last year. At his 20 week ultrasound they noticed an abnormality in his brain. My wife delivered him stillborn at the end of week 26.

Since then I’ve gone through more stressful times including the loss of my grandmother, workplace bullying (for taking time off when the baby died), started a new job, moved to a totally new area, lived with my in-laws for 6 months and purchased a new home. Not all of these things have always been bad, but they have all been stressful.

My doctor has diagnosed me with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I’ve had depression before but it feels very different this time.

I feel anger inside me. Grounding me from moving forward. It stops me from living in the moment. I can’t escape it. I’m angry that my baby died before he was born. I’m angry that his condition was 1 in 100,000 but we did everything right behaviour wise and he still ended up with it. I’m angry that we had to decide that we’d go through with the pregnancy and our son would be born having constant seizures or we abort the pregnancy and he never have to deal with that pain. I’m angry that we’re finding it hard to get pregnant again. I’m angry that my boss emotionally abused me when I returned to work. I’m angry that his behaviour led to me finding it necessary to find a new job in a new area, away from friends. I’m angry at my brother who gave me crap for leaving said job. I’m angry that people assumed that I was only the father, I wouldn’t be too upset.

That anger sits inside me and I can’t let it go. I’m at my wits end.",1593494296.0
5,Shut down this sub.,"I see people constantly posting, but only getting a reply from a bot. People looking for help with suicide, drug addiction, mental illness, and relationship issues. Either this place needs new mods, or at least have the bot steer them to an active sub that has people who can assist them. Right now this sub is definitely more harm than good.",1533302624.0
6,Just fucked my family and not sure what to do.,"So i was talking to a school counselor and made a dark joke about rape.  This leads to me getting scolded, (which I deserved), and it came out to her that a while ago, my cousin raped me. I don't really think about it, and i haven't for a really long time. My life isn't defined by that one experience, i moved on. My counselor just listened and then sent me back to class, only to call me down and tell me she has to report it and tell my parents w/ police. I panicked and called my mom because it would be better if i told her rather than the CPS lady. I thought that all of this was solved along time ago, because i told my cousins side of my family (My dad's side), 4 times in my life about this, but they all told me i made it up.(which i believed) I have moved on and don't ant to go to court or fight my cousin on this. I don't have the energy to care. Even if i do go to court i am not going to win because his dad (my uncle) is friends with every judge, prosecutor, and police officer (he works for the city as a mechanic). I just don't know what to do, and everyone is like 'Your going to need so much counseling from this' but i don't want counseling, because i was fine before all of this. Now here comes the funny part. My cousin side of my family is telling me a still made it up, but if it did happen i deserved it because i'm a slut. I find that fucking hilarious because when this happened i was 5 and my cousin was 18. I am just fucking done and i can't talk to my parents because they are mad at me because i didn't tell them. I just want to put a bullet through my skull because of this shit. Everyone on my mom and dad side hate me.",1575300485.0
7,My babies died,"It still doesn’t even feel real saying that. At 20 weeks, my baby boy was born still. His twin sister was still alive inside and the doctors thought she might make it if we could keep her in there a few more weeks. The next day she was born and lived for a few hours. 
The sadness and pain was unbearable the first few weeks. Now, I feel empty. It’s like my soul was taken from me when my babies died, and I don’t know if I’ll ever feel normal again. I miss them so badly, but that’s really the only thing I feel emotionally. Just empty. This is a nightmare. 
I’ve tried to see a therapist, and I think I scared her when I told her my situation. I’m going to see someone new this week, and I’ve started an antidepressant. But, for anyone who’s experienced this, what helped you carry on with life? Right now I feel no reason to go on. I feel no reason to do anything.",1576612346.0
8,Pregnant on the streets no where to go for Christmas depression,Was with this abousive dude. He got me pregnant and litterly dumped me on the streets.

He was very abousive dragging me down hallway by hair locking me in rooms.wasnt allowed to leave so I don't have a job.he Kicked me in the stumic when I told him I was pregnant.

9,Im A Rape Victim Terrified Of Humans,"Im a female teenager and I was sexually abused for years. From my earliest memories up until I was 11 or 12 I was molested and raped by my cousins frequently, a few times a week. I dont know what age I was when it started because I was too young to remember. For a long time I didnt recognize it as a problem because it had always been a part of my life, but I always had a terrible feeling whenever it happened. I figured I just didnt understand. 

Its been a couple of years now, I moved out of their house and havent seen them in a while, and I thought I had been recovering pretty well all things considering, but about a week ago, one of those cousins showed up again. He has been harassing me and scaring me and trying to abuse me again. My family never knew what happened, they still don't, so they have no reason to keep him away from me in their minds. 

Because of his return, I have been scared of everyone. Walking in the hallways at school causes me to panic, im constantly looking over my shoulder and I wrap my body in several layers of clothes even though it's very hot because I dont want to be exposed. I freak out whenever someone touches me, and I can't be looked at. I have to sit in the back corners of the classroom, I need to have my back against a wall so nobody can sneak up on me. 

I know this subreddit isnt meant to be therapy, but im just hoping I can get some tips from anyone who might know how to help me lower my guard. Im tired of being so scared, and I want more than anything just to feel safe for a minute at least.",1556584768.0

Hebephile is basically the attraction to 11-14 year old girls. Why the fuck, like this is so weird, like getting aroused to some 11 or 12 years old is sick.

I'll be going to a new school (starting 10th grade) where all girls are around my age or older, I had hope this would stop in that time but now I truly think it wont. Aw shit, why ?

14,Help! My boyfriend’s dog killed mine and I don’t know what to do next,"Help!!! My boyfriends dog killed my dog and I don’t know what to do next

I’m a 32f and have no children. The love of my life was my yorkie Apollo. I got him after I was in a motorcycle accident and needed several months to recover. During that time Apollo and I formed an amazing bond.
We spent 7 years snuggling, going for walks, traveling around the country, visiting the ocean etc. He helped me heal from heartbreak and depression. 
During that time I met my boyfriend and his husky mix Stella. We fell in love and instantly became a family of four. I started to feel like my life was finally falling into place.
Then 3 days before Christmas, his dog Stella snapped over a toy and attacked my precious yorkie. Apollo died in my arms on the way to the vet. I’m still suffering from ptsd after seeing my poor baby lifeless on the ground and bleeding.
Almost two months have passed and my mental health is on the brink of collapsing. I feel like my family of four is now down to 1... Me. 
Currently I still live with my boyfriend and his dog. I have expressed the effect this has on me but nothing has changed. He tells me he loves me and will do anything to help me. However, that doesn’t seem to include getting rid of his dog. Am I wrong for wanting that? I didn’t rush to have his dog euthanized for killing mine. I didn’t ask to put her in a shelter. I was hoping he would take steps into finding her a home that would have the space and time for his dog. I love my boyfriend. I want to spend the rest of my life with him. But to do that I can’t have her around me. I can’t see him spoil and care for her after what she did to me and my dog. Am I in the wrong for wanting him to get rid of her?

\*I'm a 17 year old girl from Turkey and our currency is rapidly losing value,  the country's economy is terrible.  
\*I live with my mom who is a teacher (they are paid so little in here).  
\*Because my mom wanted to give me a good future, when I got a really high score on the high school entrance exam  (yes, we take an exam in Turkey to determine which high school we will get in) she insisted on sending me to one of the best schools in the country, which is a very expensive private school which gives IB classes.  
\*I could not be as successful as I was in middle school  because of my stupid psychological problems and some mild bullying online and at school. (I feel like I am exaggerating, maybe I was the one keeping myself apart from everyone else, I am not sure)    
   
\*My only interests are arts and dancing so I still could not decide what I want to do/study in the future.  
\*To help me, my mom pays for private maths lessons, and for my psychologist. And also she is very supportive of my hobbies so she also pays for my dance classes, and lets me go to very expensive trips abroad to attend contests and stuff. And that stuff get more and more expensive every year.   


\*Because I am getting IB classes it is extremely hard for me to get into a good university in Turkey. The questions in the university entrance exam in Turkey are basically not the things I am learning at school.  And it seems like my only option is to study abroad, which is expensive. 

\*My mom tells me she could sell our house to pay for my tuition if I cannot get any scholarships from anywhere. But I don't even know where to apply in the first place and which department I should choose. And I am not even sure if I can get in anywhere.

20,Wife decided to end it all.. just trying to pick up the pieces,"Hi everyone.. I'm pretty new at this. First reddit post actually so, pardon any errors. 
27/M

I guess this story starts awhile back so, I used to work at an aerospace company and was very financially stable. This us roughly around the time of our marriage. But work stress, and anxiety/etc. Spiraled out of control until I had a short stay in a hospital behavioral health unit. I left that job and tried several others, all with the anxiety following sadly. This led to me being unemployed but seeking extensive therapy, and the works as my wife and I were beginning to struggle financially it was important to get back to work soon. 

Soon the financial stress did what it does to relationships and we grew apart. My wife had her own stay in a behavioral health unit and this is the time we got her diagnosis of bipolar 2 and she received her first prescription regiment to treat. While there, she also made a ""friend"" partially I guess she was just desperate to feel strong feelings for anything. After she was released she had decided she'd like space and requested I move out while we attended couples counciling. A few weeks later her friend is found dead on my wife's and I's driveway. Full police investigation.. etc. Ultimately determined to be a suicide by the toxicology report. It's about two weeks after this that I found her dead in the office. I'm currently collapsing like a dying star -- living back with my parents, having put my house on the market. I've got so many pieces and I don't know what it builds, it if even builds anything. I just don't know where to even begin putting them back together.",1595126159.0
21,"I'm really, really lost. This is a long story, but I hope I can get any sort of guidance or reassurance","Sorry, this is probably gonna be a little (a lot) long. This is my first ever Reddit post aside from asking permission earlier, so I also apologize if I don't really know how things work, it's really my first time ever being on Reddit but I just need somewhere to go, since I don't really have friends or family I can reach out to and talk to about these sort of things and I'm really, really scared about the emotions I'm feeling and how I'm acting.

&#x200B;

(((TLDR: I'm a very isolated person, so when I learned the only person in my life I spoke to, my bf of 4 ish years, had been cheating on me all the time and drinking behind my back and basing what he wanted from me off hentai and porn which was something I wasn't comfortable with him watching I'm devastated and don't know how to handle all these emotions I haven't felt before))

I don't have a very supportive family, we don't even talk despite living in the same house, I've had a lot of issues all through life and I've been shamed for trying to get a therapist and my parents don't allow me to do so. I'm 18 now, but since I'm broke and it's quarantine I can't really go out anymore or pay for any sort of professional help, I really only have about $50 to my name which I need for college and I can't really get a job with all the chaos going on, but this isn't the source of my issues, just what shuts me down from getting help. I've talked briefly with doctors in the past and a week of therapy which I was quickly removed from by my parents, so for context, they've all told me about symptoms I have being indicative of severe anxiety, depression, and possibly even a type of autism (like aspergers, but if I remember correctly all terms like that were just turned into ASD or autism spectrum disorder, right?), but I haven't been helped by a professional long enough to get that kind of diagnosis/treatment. I guess this is gonna read kind of like a life story, I'm so sorry if that's uninteresting or too long, sometimes just writing and pretending I'm talking to someone can help, like when I make group chats where I'm the only one in it so I can talk.

I've always been more involved in online groups than real life ones, I've always been the odd one out in groups and I think there's a few reasons. The first being that my voice sounds funny, I don't sound like my friends (I forgot to mention, but I'm 18 year old female), my voice is a lot higher than theirs and sometimes it doesn't even come out at all. Sometimes I just can't move my throat to make noise in any way, especially if I feel nervous, which isn't hard because I'm always a little nervous about something. When I was in about middle school/freshman year, I had a big group chat I was in online, with friends all over America, and I really enjoyed being there and everyone felt kind of like family. It's kind of hard to remember now, but I remember a few members kind of being their own circle, and they were a bit quieter and I later learned that it was really just 2 members and a few people who were trying to help them, I would try to message them nice things every day because they seemed really sad and soft and really.. down. I'm so sorry, but I can't remember too many of the details, but after a while, nothing was helping them and eventually they took their own lives, it feels kind of like a blur and the whole group ended up.. drifting apart. I didn't know what to do with myself, and I can't really remember too much of what happened in between or how this next event happened, but I was talking to this boy in my advanced science class, he was a grade above me and I was in this sophomore class as a freshman because I really liked science and I was really good at it. We had some games in common we liked to play online and he asked me out and I said yes and I was really hopeful, it made me feel so comforted that someone really liked me and it was like this positive light while I felt so lost. But pretty soon it changed, and he started to kind of try to 'prank' ? me I guess? I don't know why he did what he did, but during labs in science class he would burn my hands, or in the hallways he'd grab and pull the back of my hoods/necklace and it would really hurt and make me cough, and when I opened up to him about what had happened to my friends, I didn't get any of the comfort I wanted, in hindsight, I blamed myself a lot, but he took it as me saying I told them to do it, so he went to tell the school social worker and they called me to their office with phone in hand, 911 already dialed for what I was told would be an 'urgent mental eval' (she didn't end up actually calling), and that my mom was already on her way. I couldn't say anything though, I was just frozen shut, I cried a lot, but I couldn't say anything and this event is why I was in therapy for a week before my mom took me out of it, but when my mom got to the school she took me home and was yelling the whole car ride home, asking if I *wanted* to be sent to a psych ward or mental hospital and I still couldn't say anything at all, and I think that severed the final string in my connection to my family.

Fast forward to that summer, I broke things off because I was starting to get bad marks on my hands and everything hurt, and during summer I wouldn't have to see him anymore. During the late summer I met this guy online through a friend I was already close with, who I'll just call Guy as to not give out names. Guy lived halfway across the country, which wasn't anything new to me, I was used to having online friends in Europe or Asia or Canada, so halfway across the US wasn't anything weird. We started to get really close, and I wanted to tell him about myself and open up, and when I did he interjected with his own story of his first girlfriend.. going out the same way my friends did. I never spoke about it again, because his story was so much worse than mine and I didn't want to be a reminder to that, so I just stopped opening up about it at all. By now I've come to be at peace with their stories, and it no longer keeps me up at night when it used to give me horrendous nightmares every single night and I can be at ease and think about it without breaking myself down, but I learned this by myself. Guy would start to write poems and I really liked it, and soon he and I were together, from sophomore year (2016) until just about 1-2 months ago in 2020 I think, I don't have that great of a concept of time. I know online relationships are sketchy and kind of taboo, but I knew the friend I met Guy through and they went to the same school and I trusted them a lot (I didn't get catfished in this story) but I was safe and smart about it for a while, and it was working out wonderfully. He was actually taking the time to take care of me, which my very first boyfriend didn't do. The first year was wonderful, I was so happy, and it felt like I was actually cared for and I felt safe, I would really come to trust Guy and I knew his friend circle from school and everything was awesome.

And then it started to not be so great. From this point on I'm going to talk I thought, up to this point, I was asexual because I didn't feel that kind of attraction to anyone ? I wanted a companion more than anything else, not a sexual partner, I didn't have any interest in that stuff. But, with months of back and forth, I started to agree to give nudes and I kind of connected with the idea of that kind of thing and enjoyed those thoughts, I didn't ask for any pictures in return because the whole idea of nudity is so uncomfortable, even still, taking pictures for Guy was a bit difficult because I didn't want to look at myself, but he showered me in compliments so I became okay with it. I think this was in my mid sophomore year/early junior year? I can't remember exactly, everything relating to him has become super blurry lately. During this time, my relationships with friends was always thin, I always seemed on the edge of friend groups, everyone did stuff without me since I wasn't really part of the core group ? I don't really know if that makes sense, I hope it does. I wasn't the core of any friend group, especially with girls. So I just kind of went about my days by myself and trying to go to the odd birthday party or other event when I was invited, but I started to get so nervous and scared that I started to not want to go anymore because being around other people was just so exhausting I would be nearing blackout by the end of a day with friends. So when Guy started to demand more and more attention from me, it wasn't hard to just kind of disappear out of all my friend groups to just do everything (playing video games/spending time) exclusively with him. (I forgot to mention but he's my age, only 20 days older than I am, so 18 y/o male)  Around this time as well I got my first job, I was a guide at a zipline park and it was pretty fun, I got to be out in nature which I really liked and my bosses were the owners and they were very friendly. Between me and Guy, a lot of individual events started to happen, and things were going downhill I think. This is where he started to ask for more than just pictures, he wanted me to write on myself with markers, and uh.. insert things into myself, and wear thongs and clothes I had no interest in. I went out of my way to buy lingerie, and I tried to do everything he asked but inserting things really hurt, but he always seemed so sad or gumpy if I didn't do everything he wanted. He would also have me write things like 'slut' and 'bitch' and 'fuckmeat' and 'This toy is open 24/7' and he'd want me to take pictures and videos at angles I wasn't comfortable with or do the silly aheago face, and I *NEVER* showed my face in any (what we called) spice pictures. I didn't like it, and he wanted it multiple times a day, and I was never in the right mood to begin with, and I never masturbated so the whole inserting thing stuff was really.. weird, it didn't feel good, it just hurt. Sometimes I even missed work because he would be so demanding with it. Regardless of where or when,, he'd always message and ask, if I was at work I'd slip away to the bathrooms with my phone, same with school. Whenever he got mad at me, he would just leave entirely. He would just dump me on the spot and I would plead for him to come back and he would come back like maybe a week later. This happened countless times, probably like once a month.

While this was going on, at school and at work I'd have guys come try to befriend me, and it made me happy because I wasn't good at reaching out to others even though I wanted to, I was always too scared. But then they'd ask me out after one day of talking to me and I would say no, I'm already dating someone, and they'd get mad and say mean things about me and I don't really understand it and it really hurt, like no one wanted to be my friend, I was just some pretty item people wanted to have in their house after 1 class of talking to me that day. There are so many stories about this, it would be too much to write them all here. I was really hurt though, but I couldn't tell Guy because if I mentioned any dude's name around him he would leave and come back next week, and I didn't want that because that abandonment really sucked and hurt. Since I also didn't really have any friends, I always just kind of kept it all to myself until now.

Another big thing is that i HATE alcohol, I hate the smell, my dad drinks a lot. Guy always said he hated it because he tried it once as a kid and it tasted like gasoline, so he was never ever gonna drink any and that was a big reassurance for me because I can't even speak to people who are intoxicated. During high school, I'd sometimes have those guys that would be mad at me message me while they were drunk and I would have to shut my phone all the way off to not see any messages because I didn't know what to do. In junior year I was invited to a 3 week exchange trip to Germany, I convinced my parents to let me go and I was so excited, I love languages and it really clicks with me and makes sense to me and I really like travelling and airports and planes. The trip was overall really fun, except for that Guy was mad about it, so I spent most of the days in my host's room on my phone trying to make it up to him. Carnival was around this time, and in German style they were throwing all sorts of candies and tiny alcohol bottles from the floats in the parade. I was with a group of the German students and they were trying to encourage me to drink and I said no, but it escalated to them trying to hold it to my mouth like a baby bottle I think, and eventually they got it in my mouth and the glass banged on my teeth which really hurt, even though it was a tiny little bottle. They made me drink a bit and when I got back to my host's house I texted Guy and he was so mad, he didn't speak to me for the rest of the trip. He always, through this whole time, assumed I was cheating on him. He would insult me for any reason I wouldn't reply right away, he would assume I'm ""out sucking dick to some trailer trash"" (Guy had an odd fixation on having his.. sucked, which I didn't want any part of, that's majorly gross to me and I hate it, he explained it to me and it's just disgusting I don't understand it but I don't want it in my mouth). So when I explained that I didn't feel good and I was just forced to drink alcohol, he assumed I was out partying and he left for the rest of the trip.

So fast forward a little bit, I don't really remember chronologically what happened when, but these are just.. Things that bothered me. Turns out, that whole story of his first girlfriend passing by her own accord was a big lie, it was false. I was really hurt by this, and I told him it's not okay because hey that's pretty messed up to do, but I forgave it in the end. He also transferred to a new school, I'll call his new school A and his old school B. His B school friends were still really close to him, but he also had new friends at school A. This is where it really hurts the most for me. Turns out, whenever he left me for like a week or so, he would tell his A school friends that I cheated on him and I'm a bad person, and then he never told them about it anymore. He didn't let me talk to his friends anymore. I'm gonna jump a bit more forward to a bit more recent, like a few months ago. He put me in a discord server with him and his B school friends and another server for a DND campaign with his school A friends, including a girl I'll call Badass because she's really cool. She seemed oddly flirty with her in the chat, and one day him and school A friends went to a restaurant and he sent me a picture and she had her hand on his, and I was very upset by this because ?? He said he wasn't interested in anybody else and he made it very clear that he was with me, to my knowledge at the time. He then claimed to go to a trampoline park afterwards alone to get away from everyone because i was upset.

Now, here is where everything fell apart. We were playing a game and there was someone at the door he said was specifically his 6'1 friend Benji, which was a blatant lie in the message he sent. So I decided to be bold and secretive and ask one of his school A friends if he knew anything about it and out came all the truth. At school A, he was friends with benefits with Badass, and had multiple girlfriends, and one at school B, which lasted 6 months. At school A he had a tinder account and he hooked up with girls all the time, and he also drank a lot behind my back and back at school B he apparently showed off my nudes to his friends. Among other news, I was devastated by this.

At the time I learned this, I had been working on a minecraft adventure world for a surprise for him, I spend 326 total hours on a wonderful world just for him, all by hand. I was horrified and even typing this now I can't feel my fingers. He was the only real person I had in my life and I trusted him with my life. There's a few things omitted from this post but even still, I'm so incredibly hurt by all of this. I confronted him and I went and opened up to all his school A friends that I had kinda talked to in passing when discussing the campaign and told them what was going on. All his lies have come out, and even still talking about it makes me cry even though its been 2 ish months? I forget when, I shut down really hard with all of this and it's so hard to remember things the right way, especially with dates/times. After a few weeks of having him blocked on everything, I decided to unblock him because I learned through his friends that he was getting help like my final request to him was. I told him that I really wanted to wonderful person I knew he could be to come out and he can get help with his lying and manipulative nature and kinda god complex and stuff, and he was actually doing that, my best case scenario was happening. I unblocked him and we've started talking again and he always expresses how fucked up the things he did were, but he's trying really hard to overcome and learn from his mistakes.

I've kinda come out of my depressive pit to talk to him, talking to people makes me incredibly nervous, but when I talk to him I get so angry, I've never really felt anger before all this happened. It makes me hit myself and bruise my legs and I self harmed initially when I was really really low. I try to really stay on top of this stuff and stay in control of myself as best I can, but I just feel like I'm watching myself go crazy. It's like every single night I still cry and usually I end up just yelling at him and getting angry and storming off, I don't mean to, and I look back and cringe at everything I said because I didn't really mean it and it just makes me sad to see just how out of control I am. I've never had any angry outbursts before this, not even in frustration, the most I've ever done in the past is maybe toss my phone on my bed when I feel too frustrated to set it down and it always just goes straight from angry/frustrated to incredibly sad. I'm back to my insomnia habits and I have only really bad dreams if I sleep at all and I keep randomly crying and I can't try to remember anything because it makes me really sad because all my memories have him involved to some extent. I'm just so angry and hurt by it all. I don't trust a word he says, so it feels like I just come out from under my covers in the morning to get mad and cry and maybe drink water. I've lost a few pounds going from \~101 lbs to \~97 lbs because I don't eat very much because it just makes me feel sick, for like the first week after the confrontation happened when I learned everything I was vomiting every day at least once. I don't trust anyone, even the odd message I get maybe once every 2 weeks from people who used to be friends of mine, I don't trust them either, I certainly don't trust my own family since they've just yelled at me or ignored me or shamed me my whole life or my dad trying to pull out my teeth when I was a really little kid. I'm so sad and angry and sensitive all the time and I'm not really sure how to handle it because the source of my pain is still here talking to me, I don't really want to just leave and try talking again months from now because I feel like I would just be entirely alone and he's making good progress so far and tries to help me, even when I'm mad and yelling and being unreasonable. I don't have the slightest idea as to what I can do to take back control on my emotions so I don't erupt or break down sobbing so many times a day.

Sorry again for this being so long, this isn't everything but it's just some of the biggest things on my mind and I'm so clueless on how to actually handle it and cope.",1594672919.0
22,"Strict parents making me miss out on my teenage years (F, 15)","I’m 15 and the amount of times I’ve been able to hang out with friends my whole life is honestly pretty sad. Anytime someone would ask me to hang out, I would just say no because I knew my parents would most likely say no and I would’ve been too nervous to ask anyways because I would have to wait for them to be in a good mood, tell them in advance, etc. 

I never have been good with making friends when I was younger. If I was at the park, my brother would be the one making all these friends while I was pretty much alone. I wanted to make friends yet I didn’t know how, this is still a problem for me now.

As I grew up, I rarely hung out with friends and I immediately went home after school. My parents are strict and traditional so because I’m a women, my only responsibilities are to clean, cook, take care of my sister, and stuff like that. My brother, however, doesn’t need to do any chores because my mom claims that “Men do the work, while women do the cleaning.”

This is the the type of shit that gets me mad because he’s capable of cleaning after his shit yet he doesn’t need to clean because he’s a male. He’s also allowed to hang out with friends, go to the park or bike ride by himself, date, call his friends and stay in his room all day.

If I ever talk to the other gender, my parents completely flip out and as a result, they took away my phone and I haven’t had it for more than a year. They checked my phone every night, looking at my pictures, reading my text messages, browsing through my history. I felt violated and I lied about the password I had, which made me get grounded. All my friends told me that their parents never checked their phones but my parents have been doing that for years. I now have a curfew of 10pm-12am.

I have a iPad I use but I’m not on it much. I don’t get much alone time because my little sister constantly wants to play with me. If I’m at the park with my sister, I can’t talk to anyone else my age because I have to play with my sister. Meanwhile, my brother is able to play basketball and bike ride with his friends at the park while I can’t.

If I’m ever out with my family, I get extremely jealous whenever I say kids my age hanging out with friends. I instantly become sad and I try not to stare because I’m just not used to experiencing time alone with friends. It makes it even harder because I lost so many of my friends and I feel lonely all the time. I feel like I have nobody else to talk to either and I just keep everything inside.

My parents also got upset with me when I used to have all nighters with my friends and keep in mind, I was only thirteen. I was never allowed to have sleepovers so this was the closet I got to one. That year was the best year of my life and most of my friends were guys just because they were so much easier to talk to and relate to. My mom still calls me a slut for that.

I don’t know what to do anymore, I feel completely stripped from a social life. Every time I go on Instagram and see people with their friends or people in real life with their friends, I’m still never used to it. Sometimes I forget teenagers are able to go out with friends. Almost all the times I’ve been out with my friends (a very low number) have been with my mother nearby and it feels awkward because I can’t be myself. 

Since I feel so lonely all the time, I think I honestly might be depressed. I’m not trying to self diagnose but it’s so hard watching everything from the sidelines. I’m never going to get this time back and all I really did my childhood was stay home all day. Having no one to talk to made me create a sort of barrier so I wouldn’t get hurt if someone left me again. I sound overdramatic but there’s this indescribable feeling not being able to have a social life. I can’t even make my own decisions anymore because I rely on my parents so much.

They used to tell me from a very young age, almost brainwashing me, constantly telling me that I’m not allowed to have a boyfriend until I’m in college and that I should be a doctor. They persuaded me to be a doctor so much to the point where I wrote on this worksheet in fourth grade that I wanted to be a doctor and looking back now, it’s fucked up because I’ve never actually wanted to be a doctor. When I told them I wanted to be a detective and study criminal justice, my dad said it wasn’t a real job and I was heartbroken. He says I don’t need friends because I need to study and friends won’t help me get through college. My mom says she was always out with her friends when she was my age yet why are they restraining me from a social life? I told them I wanted to go to college in a different country and they disapproved, saying there are good colleges where we lived and that we would have enough money for tuition. I wanted to move because I wanted to experience life on my own and be able to make long, fulfilling friendships and relationships with nobody holding me back. I also thought tuition was way too much in the U.S. and it really is. 

It’s at this point where I get nervous when I talk to a fucking cashier. If I can’t even talk to a damn cashier, where the hell am I gonna make it in life? If I never have a boyfriend, how will I ever know what to do in a relationship? If I never have a social life, how am I gonna stop getting so nervous when I’m talking to people? If I’m not able to explore the world on my own, will I ever be able to make my own decisions?

My mom even talked to my high school and said that she wanted me in a medical class and I went along with it because I knew it was what she wanted. She managed to get me into all honors my sophomore year but in order to take a medical terminology class, I would have to leave three of my honor classes and we decided it wasn’t worth it to leave three honor classes. I almost felt like it was a sign to be honest.

But when I saw that in order to be a detective, you needed good social skills, my heart honestly fucking dropped. Like I said, being constrained from a social life has its fucking cons. My parents have never prepared me for real life and I’ve never been able to experience the world on my own, with my own choices. 

So tell me, are my parents strict or did they seriously fuck up with me?",1599943426.0

38,I think I was sexually harassed?,"Sorry if my english is bad. It's not my first language.
A few months ago, before the quarantine started, I was at my grandparents house on the pool. We were talking about how I still can't swim even tho I'm already 15 and mom told my step grandpa to teach me a little.
Mom and the others were inside the house while he was teaching me. He was holding me stomach down at the level of the waterand telling me how to move my legs and arms and etc. He had his hands on the rib area and above my knees. It was going fine but eventually I felt that his hand that was on my leg was now on my private part. I thought It was an accident and just faked losing balance so he had to pick me up again and do it right next time, but his hand kept ending up there.
I did struggle a few times to see his reaction but he didn't do anything and kept being like ""it's not that hard you won't fall it's alright"" like he didn't notice still, but I doubt he didn't. 
Eventually he went to get meat or whatever bcuz barbecue and I was panicking at the side of the pool not knowing if that was an accident or not. When he came back he kept insisting that I try again to learn properly and bugged me about for like 4 minutes. He always was annoying and insisted in stuff all the time, like how he kept giving everyone more juice even tho they said they didn't want it 15 times, so I don't know if that means anything?? But even with all that I think it's very unlikely that he didn't notice what he was doing, he's not that old (I think he's around 50?).
At the time I was very scared but mostly confused. I was just stressed the whole day and cried at night when everything sunk in. I used to have a lot of nightmares with pedophiles when I was around 7 or 8 because of those south park episodes with Michael Jackson, and I'm starting to have them again.
Am I reading too much into this? Or should I be worried? Should I do anything about it?",1594473713.0
39,"I (F27) had a bad situation with two friends (M30, F35) this weekend, and I’m having difficulty dealing with it","Copied from my post in another sub because it doesn’t look like it’s showing up. And sorry about the long text, I needed to get this off my chest.

**TL;DR** Got very drunk with some friends the other day and blacked out. Found out the next day that they had pulled me into a threesome of sorts with them, even though I said I didn’t want to, was barely participating, and was falling asleep. I’m a survivor from a previous situation years before that I got therapy for, but I feel like this is triggering me and I can’t stop the anxiety.

I work with these people and I’m having difficulty dealing with this. I’m a survivor from a separate situation a few years ago, and I think this is triggering me. My long distance boyfriend is moving in with me in a week, and I want to deal with this before then.

Saturday a guy friend of mine that used to work at the bar I work at came in during my shift and we started drinking together. We were planning on having a fun chill night drinking. Then the girl came in after her shift at the restaurant next door ended and joined us. I felt a little uncomfortable when she joined us because I know they have a tendency to go really hard when together, but I didn’t say anything. Bad idea.

We all got very tipsy and then walked to a nearby place to have dinner, where we drank some more. Then another bartender friend bought us shots. By this time, my memory starts going in and out. I know they know how low my tolerance is for alcohol (especially for a bartender), we had even talked about it earlier. I should have curbed my drinking, but we were having fun.

I brought them to my new apartment to show them around. Idk what happened, but the next thing I remember is we were in the pool I share with 5 other apartments, in our underwear. One of them ordered Drizzly and then I had a handle of Jameson being handed to me. I remember taking a pull. I should have stopped.

Next thing I know, the girl is naked. I don’t know when that happened. Then I remember her trying to kiss me, but really it was like biting at my face. I made it clear I didn’t want to. But I think she did it multiple times. 

That’s when I completely black out. I wake up in my bed with a shirt on. The guy is in bed too. I figure they had just stayed the night, no big deal. The girl had left early to get to work. I find out she left her underwear, which is weird, but no big deal. We’re hungover so we grab some beers from the fridge and go to get breakfast nearby and decide we’ll bring the girl her underwear during her break. Then the guy tells me that we had a threesome. My first reaction is “I don’t remember, please don’t tell me.” He says “I know you don’t want to know, because your boyfriend, but...” and then proceeds to tell me a few details, that I don’t want to recount. But apparently I was falling asleep during it. 

At the time I was upset, but moreso because it had happened. And I was embarrassed because I hadn’t wanted to do anything with them, but apparently I still had.

Then I talked to the girl. I told her I don’t remember any of it, and don’t particularly care to. She tells me, “It’s really not as bad as you think, you barely participated.” Apparently I had been going to sleep and they initiated it. She and the guy had sex while I was in bed. I know I was touched in some way, I just don’t want to know how.

After the hangover was gone and I could think clearly again the next day, it started bothering me. I had obviously made it clear to them I didn’t want anything. Now I have bruises all over my body, and some burst blood vessels on my breast, and I can’t even look at myself in the mirror. 

I keep blaming myself for drinking that much. And I’m so embarrassed we did that in a shared pool in the apartment I just moved into. My landlord, who lives in one of the other apartments, was a little rude to me about not knowing what day the trash is picked up, so I think he’s upset with me too and I’m so embarrassed. 

I told my boyfriend and he was amazing. His first reaction was “This can’t keep happening,” because the past two weeks I’ve been drinking with friends I had situations like a different girl kissing me out of the blue and a different guy grabbing my ass and aggressively trying to get me to go home with him. But he said he understood I wasn’t entirely there and it wasn’t my fault. He asked me if he thought I had sex with anyone, and I told him I definitely did not. He told me the next day he had been a little bit upset, but got over it because he knew it wasn’t my fault. I’m trying not to let him know how much it’s upsetting me because he’s going to be working at the same restaurant with the girl.

I told one friend the whole story and she has been incredibly helpful. But I’ve been feeling emotionally exhausted. I’ve thrown up multiple times, which happens to me when I’m having extreme stress and anxiety. I don’t want to confront the two people, although I made it clear that it wasn’t okay. I’m getting ready to start medical school, and I already have so much stress, I just want to work through this so I can move on. 

I keep blaming myself.",1593804312.0
40,My boyfriend shattered my heart this week.,"I dated him for 4 years, 3 of which we lived together. Due to some trying circumstances we moved back to our parents houses which are 2 hours away from each other. He didn't want long distance. I'm in school so I dont mind because I'm busy often regardless. 

On and off hes been flipping back and forth between ""I love you, you're who I wanna be with"" and ""I'm not sure I can be ""tied down"" to you with this distance. He went out of town last weekend and came back with telling me:

 ""I cant be your full time boo, I'm 23 years old, I need to live my life. It's now or never. But you're still my main girl and you're who I want to be with. I just can't with this distance.""

It's been back and forth with this and I think there's already girls hes interested in. I keep wondering If I made the right choice. It's hard to stand by it. But I don't think anyone would stay after hearing that. I'm going through finals atm and I just cant function. I need to get through the day.",1576071964.0
41,I was diagnosed with clinical depression a year ago this is for anyone going through the same thing,"I don’t know if it’s relevant at all but I’m going to start by saying that I’m 25, male, university student.  
While I’m perfectly aware that my journey and yours are different, I want to write some realizations I’ve had that helped me become happier in the hope that anyone reading this going through something similar can grab a bit of inspiration. 

I’m sure depression doesn’t affects us all the same but here is how it affected me. While I didn’t feel sad all the time, it was more like most of my feelings were muted, diluted or watered down. I felt physically weak constantly, my memory was fuzzy, I had a hard time leading a normal life because of the constant lethargy just barely going through the motions. My enjoyment of things I loved, diminished exponentially to the point I eventually dropped them. I became bitter, constantly  critiquing and nit picking everything which probably made me lose some friends (nobody wants that negative energy). I was overly conscious and hated anywhere crowded, I felt like people were staring at me, if I heard laugher I would  unconsciously think they were maybe laughing at me. If I had to equate depression to something more relatable  It’s like being locked in a dark room with no idea on how to get out. 

I’ve pondered on why I felt this way, why I can’t be happy and over how can to improve myself.  I’ve pondered on it a lot, took some measures and while I can’t say I’m completely fine now, I can confidently say I am happier. Here’s the advice I have for you:
 
-Meditate: I know it sounds vague but actually do it, sit and think deeply about what it is that’s stopping you from being happy/normal/successful. Finding the root of the problem is the first step to solve it. Me personally, after a lot of self analysis, I concluded I didn’t like who I became and the life situation I was in. 

-Visualize: Picture what you think would make you happy. Since I didn’t like myself , I visualized where I wanted to be and what personality traits I desired to posses. I wished I could be cheerful, positive, honest and responsable and well of course, successful . Sounds like a lot, but like a building I now believe you are the engineer of your life and you’re in charge of building it up to however high you want it to be, nobody will do it for you.

-make a small term goals: pick something about you or your life that makes you unhappy that you feel it’s the easiest to change. Don’t attempt to suddenly change everything about you or your life, because chances are you won’t stick to it. Make short term goals, like going out for a 15 minute walk every morning or actively try to remain positive through the day. 

-If you relapse: If you fell to your vices again be it lethargy stopped you from doing what you needed to do, or you went back to your negative thoughts. Calm down, you’re not a failure, it’s does not mean it’s imposible for you. When asked by a reporter “How did it feel to fail 1,000 times?"" Edison replied, ""I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with a 1,000 steps"" If each time you relapse or fall into negativity again,you ponder on it, take a different approach or avoid the trigger, you’re on the right track and you absolutely will accomplish it. 

We all have a part of ourselves that out of self preservation or maybe fear of failure, stops us from even trying to accomplish our goals. I feel that in some people, like myself, that part often speaks the loudest  “you’re not like them, you can’t do it!”. I struggle with this part of me every single day, but considering the state that I was in, doing nothing and remaining lethargic was just going to keep me miserable, so fight it with all you got. You’re not alone in this, while it is your journey and they’re your demons I do believe and hope there’s people around you to encourage you  along the way. 

While I’m unsure if this lengthy post will be given attention,cast some light into any of you, or go unnoticed. I just hope to tell you if you’re going through depression, that you’re not alone in this.

Please, feel free to message me should you want to for whatever reason. Let’s encourage each other in our journey.",1573794553.0

45,"During an argument we can focus too much on being ""right"" and lose sight of being kind. By considering their view, not reacting immediately and considering our words carefully we can practice building stronger relationships and create a kinder world for ourselves and others","Its easy when you're in a heated discussion to get carried away - we can say unkind things in the course of trying to win an argument. But giving someone a piece of our mind (even when we think we're right) can escalate a situation and put us in a worse situation than before we opened our mouths. Instead we can try and understand where the other person is coming from and consider our words carefully, as well as taking a step back and becoming more aware of the thoughts that lead to unkind speech.

46,SENSITIVE TOPIC WARNING: none of my friends want to exist anymore,"So pretty much all of my friends are trying to die right now. One attempted suicide in December. Another was hospitalized for self harm in February. A different one attempted suicide in March and has continued to severely harm herself as recent as 3 days ago. Someone close to one of my friends committed suicide, and now that friend has started self-harming as of today. 

I'm trying to support them, but I can't, I know I can't. I can't be there for all of them if none of them are doing what they can to help themselves.

I'm tired, exhausted, emotionally drained, and to be honest, I'm starting to get upset, almost angry. I've been there, I've been in similar states of mind that they are in, so I know they need my patience and support. But I can't deal with all of this at once. I can handle a lot of it, I've been fine handling so much of it. But hearing that a close friend of mine started self harming today, I guess that was it. Thats what made me break. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm not going to stop supporting them, they're my friends, I love them and care for them, and I want them to be okay. But  I don't know how to cope with this all at once.

What the hell am I supposed to do?",1587434866.0
47,"I just ""broke up"" with my mother and I am in shambles","I am a 40+ y.o. man and told my mother I won’t ever talk with her again.

The relationship has always been strained, and I had years of therapy, but these words didn’t come out of my mouth through a calculated move.

I left her a voicemail a month ago, with good news about something that had happened to me. A week ago, she responded by text, telling me she had just listened to the memo, and that she’d call me at night. At night she didn’t call, and I tried to reach her, to no avail.

Today, she called me by accident. I told her calmly that I felt hurt by the sequence of events. She told me I was being dramatic and that there was no reason for me to feel that way. I got angry and raised my voice, and reiterated that I felt hurt and that I wished to be heard when expressing it. The answer was that ""no you’re not hurt, you’re angry, because you just have emotional management issues"".

The words just came out of my mouth before I became aware of them: ""That’s it, that’s enough. Goodbye forever."" And I hung up.

I feel guilty, sad, and very oddly, exactly how I had felt after every breakup in my life (serious relationships).

48,List of things I'm finding F*** up with COVID,"Work in hospital
1. Seeing a person approaching there last dies of life, knowing their son, daughter, grandchildren are at home oblivious to how unwell their relative is
2. Explaining to an elderly person or a person with dementia why their relative isn't there visiting and it's not because they don't 
Love or care for them it's because they are not allowed
3. Whilst no visiting is allowed the 30 min I spend with a person is probably the most conversation they have in that day
4.  Hearing a person is end of life and relieved that decision has been made so the family can see and grieve for this person as you have seen them deteriorate everyday for a week 
5. Seeing a 50 year old man an hour before being intubated when he is so scared as he doesn't know if he will wake up again
6. Seeing an unconscious mother to 4 children under 16 and not knowing what her voice sounds like, her personality or anything about her 
7. Seeing a 30 year old gasping for air as he moves from bed to bedside chair but panicking mid way as he has lost his wedding ring and worried about his wife's reaction, not realising how close she is to being widowed
8. Seeing 33 year old whose girlfriend is pregnant and just seeing your own family member in him and frightened how easy it could be him in that situation
9. Day after day seeing the same person in an ITU bed, treating them daily but never seems to be getting better 
10. Looking at the ITU handover sheet and the realising half of them are males just over 50 without and major medical condition and realising it could easily be your father 
11. Worried you don't care enough as your emotions start to go numb when your on ITU as you don't know that person personally
12. Having extra respiratory shifts and on calls and hating every moment as you are responsible for keeping someone alive and you just don't feel qualified and cable of doing this 
13. Always expecting things to get worse. More ITU patients. More COVID wards and never seeing an end in site.
14. Not knowing what to say when someone asks how is work. You are always expecting it to be worsen so at the moment it is manageable but realistically everything is awful. You don't want to scare people by telling them how things, you don't want their admiration and clap for carers as your just doing your job and you don't want them to think it's all good when it's not. 
15. You don't want to theoretically explain why  80 year olds wouldn't be ITU candidates in a family chat which include your grandparents. 
16. You don't want to explain risk factors of mortality in a family chat when people in it are high risk 

Family. 
17. Not seeing parents  for months and weeks 
18. Being fed up with every phone call ending up talking about the same topic and understand why as their is nothing to talk about but then feeling guilty as your feeling fed up of talking to a loved one 
19. Not looking forward to Friday family chat but then feeling extremely guilty for not wanting to see your family, but it's been a shit week and you want to unwind and not pretend things are ok for any longer 
20. Worried your grandparents are going to get it and knowing the outcomes
21. Worried your parents will get it and substituting their faces into your ITU patients 
22. When your partner has it, monitoring their sleep, monitoring every time they cough or any new symptom for signs or deterioration, constantly on edge they are going to be hospitalised
23. When you have it, pretending you feel ok as you don't want people to worry but really your so scared 
24. Not living in the local vicinity so you can't go for a socially distanced walk with your mom, dad, nan, grandad, aunt or cousins 
25. Seeing other members of your family do this and being grateful that they have each other but envious you can't do this 
26. For 3 months only seeing work colleagues and no socialising face to face with any family or friends 
27. Seeing others break the rules and not even bothering to hide it on social media 
28. No one else realising what you are going through as your not high maintaince and don't like talking about it.
29. Not knowing other people are struggling or are upset as they also don't talk about there struggles 
30. Feeling alone as your a have fun family and not a talky feely bunch.

51,Almost 4 1/2 years later I'm still struggling with moving on from a relationship and I hadn't realised just how much it still effected me until I broke down today.,"TL;DR struggling to move on from a very toxic relationship that ended over 4 years ago. Very abusive emotional and somewhat physically. I stupidly Facebooked his new girlfriend and I just started crying crying crying.

Really long post sorry. 

A bit of background on the relationship: 
I got with this man when I was 17 he was 22. He was known as the bad guy and I used to hang around with him and his friends from the ages 14 onwards. I was raped by some of his friends/groomed with alcohol and drugs. He always used this against me and called me a slag and that no one else would have me. 
I was no angel also, at times I would hit back and scream and kick. I used to meet guys behind his back but it never went further than getting attention off men. 
He would, as I later found out, cheat on me constantly and even had a girlfriend for a year before we broke up. 
He was arrested for abuse on several occasions throughout the relationship, my drug addiction got worse, he isolated me from friends and family. We would have just ups in the street. He even left me alone in Thailand after dragging me across the floor of our apartment and I had to sleep in a Swedish families apartment. 
It was horrendous. I didn't properly. I lost a lot of friends. I lost a lot of weight and turned to alcohol and drugs. 
I got pregnant with another man's baby during one of our ""off"" periods. I was too scared to admit what I had done so let (I'll call him M) M know. Admittedly this was a really really bad thing I did allowing a man to believe he was a father of a baby. 
The truth came out after social services got involved due to drug taking and abuse and my poor mental health.

I feel I look bad in all of this because: 
. I hit back 
. I used to send these horrible messages to him 
. I led him to believe he was the father of my son 
. Drug addiction  
. Mental illness 

He constantly would call me not right in the head, crazy, no one else would have me, fucking slag. 

Bringing us to today: 
I went on Facebook and the idea popped in to my head to search for his new girlfriend. Stupid I know but curiosity got the better of me. 
She's stunning. Beautiful. Nose ring (which I was never allowed to have nor tattoos or listen to my mind of music) 
They look so happy in their pictures. 

My life today is so good I have my son, my mental health is managed, I've been clean a while and I have a great partner. But I fell to pieces before... and it made me realise that I do talk a lot about him in therapy and sometimes I argue with him in my head and struggle with trust etc. 
But I'm still not fully over the emotional stuff and the intense anger and the ""unfairness"" of it all. 
So any advice or kind words would be appreciated. 

Sorry for the long post.",1580300496.0

53,Hit a kid with my car,"Background info-
Live in the UK
First car, volvo xc60 (SUV), driving for 6 months

Driving down a two lane road around 8pm so night time
Right hand lane is traffic waiting at a red to turn right, left hand is clear and has turned green. 

I approach around 25/30mph, just as I get to the light a kid cycles in front of my car. I brake asap obviously but he hits the car and rolls up my windshield before flying off a metre or so away. 

Kid seems fine, ambulance called, other drivers get out to assist. The scene calms down and lots of people offer me their info in case I need to claim I wasn't at fault.
Kid is 12 and was not wearing a helmet, but seems pretty unscathed other than obviously a lot of tears.

Kids dad arrives eventually, notes that I've wrecked his new bike and eventually they head off in ambulance.

Minimal info is exchanged but obviously I call police when I head home to report the accident, who tell me to present myself at a station within 24h

Anxiety through the roof, struggling to sleep because I can literally see the moment when he looked up at my car.

Any advice?

But then my dad tried to drag me downstairs, my little brother kept shouting 'don't hurt her' trying to get in the way, Dad said he wouldn't and proceeded to do the opposite of what he said. Mum closed my window, I presume is so no one could hear me scream.

Recently I found out (because my younger sister wanted to use my moms guitar and yada yada but she brought up that I have my own guitar since I piped into their conversation), I found out that it was not in fact a hand me down and my mom had payed it off for months. It was probably around 300 usd. But so I feel so guilty. So so so guilty. If I had only known, I would have cherished it from the start. I’m holding it as I type this and I feel so bad. She worked so hard to get it for me and I barely used it. Idk if I’m feeling guilt or regret I think both. But it is definitely so special to me now but I feel so bad Idk what to do. I don’t think I could tell my mom that I thought it was an old guitar at first without extremely hurting/offending her. Idk what to do I feel so so so bad.",1576705128.0
57,My mind constantly reminds me of bad memories.,"Ever since I was a kid I've had a good memory, it's been helpful throughout education, but d'etre mental in every other place. I haven't had the most stable family growing up, lot of fighting and verbal abuse, not always at me, but the fights are clear in my mind. 

As I got older instead of being able to recall stuff easily, my mind just started throwing memories at me. Y'know like when you're going to sleep and you remember something that keeps you up, it's like that whenever I'm not concentrating on something. I was medicated in my late teens, but I didn't like the way it made me feel. Then I tried to get therapy through the NHS, but unless you are heavily suicidal the wait list was upwards of 6 months. I'm not suicidal so the call didn't come in until I had left for uni and was in a different part of the country.

I tried self medicating for at uni, which honestly made me feel good. Nowadays, I drink... It either helps or sometimes fuels the fire, as I wake up  remembering every dumb thing I did the night before, I mean everything. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore.",1572886257.0

I know I’m still a ‘kid’, I don’t know what made me think I was ready to make a decision like that. I’m not a good liar, and I’ve always been so close with my mom, it’s torture to be around her because I’m constantly battling with the fact that I could never tell her what I did. Although deep down I’m sure she would accept it and help me work through my anxieties, I can’t possibly imagine the look of disappointment on her face. It’s really at the point where I feel suicidal just thinking about it. There was definitely a little coercion, but it was my decision and I consented. Really, I just need some reassurance, thoughts, different perspectives, because I feel like I’m drowning with all of it on my own.

I can not oh and that tax bill back up to a little over 1600. I was devastated. I still am. I have applied for hundreds of jobs, but no one ever called back. I have degrees. I have a solid history before I became a nurse. All my bills are due. Savings gone paying bills for last 2 months. I never ever thought I would be here again in my life. Everywhere you look right now you see Kardasians throwing ridiculous parties, one cake would probably pay off my debt. Stars spending weeks at spas or vacation getaways most of us don't even bother dreaming of. For the most part I have never cared let them live their ridiculous lives. What kills me is so many of them get ridiculous tax breaks or haven't paid their taxes and they can still work. How do they expect to get their money when the downpayment for the payment plan is high af and then the company that deals with their debt has to wait a month to get other paperwork after initial payment paid.

67,"2020 has been marred with loss. I'm struggling to cope with the barrage of deaths and it's leading to paranoia. It's no longer a matter of when it might happen again, it's who is going to die next.","To preface, I'm only 24. Three of these losses were all within my age group. Young, aspiring dudes that added to every single life they touched in profound ways. These guys were loved by everyone. One of them shot himself, the other committed suicide through ODing, and the others heart just... stopped working. I grew up alongside a 2 of these dudes. The other was a new friend that works with me. He was supposed to be at a little COVID-friendly beer pong party at my place with a few of my good friends. That's how raw all of this is. All 3 of these dudes died back to back, only giving a week in between to cope with the last.   


I almost quit my job because the pressure was really getting to me. I can't sleep because I'm scared of either not waking up or waking up to yet another loss. My boss pulled me into the office to talk me out of my impulsive decision and allowed me a chance to get a lot off of my chest. I told him that because of my 2 friends I have grown paranoid. I'm terrified of death at this point in time it feels like death is at the doorstep. I told him I spend everyday awaiting news of yet another loss. I agreed to stay on the job and he gave me a few days off to clear my head and come back.  


The first day I came back my personal life bled into my professional life. When I told him it's just a matter of who at this point, we got our answer that same day. That's when we found out that my new friend had passed away. A kid that he hired. I felt like death had become inescapable. Work was my escape from the hurt I have for my friends. On my first day back there was a somber tone throughout the entire building. We worked alongside this dude everyday, sometimes spending more time with him than our own families. Just like that, we will never see him again.   


I know death is a part of life. I didn't expect to be in my mid 20s and have so many people I wanted to spend a lot more time with just go away like that. It's had a big impact on a handful of us and I worry that these two suicides have stirred up suicidal ideation in several of my friends. Usually these things follow. I too have found myself in a downward spiral. One that's been on a very fast and hard drop straight down.   


I haven't lost people like I have this year. In February I woke up to discover that my aunt, a woman like a mother to me, had died. When my best bud overdosed that's when the reality of my aunt actually being gone hit me. I thought I was handling it well but it turns out that I had just tucked the hurt deep down. My childhood died a couple of weeks ago. Mentally, physically, and emotionally. I've paid close attention to the stages of grief I've been cycling through, but I feel like I've just tossed all of that out and went straight into a manic phase. I'm not the same person I was at the start of October and I fear this is doing some serious long term damage to my mental health.",1603760865.0

Yesterday I woke up at 5 am to my mother breaking down and my father in shock.

I live in a small town in NS Canada where you really don’t hear much crazy events happening, or any suicide rate for that matter.

My cousin was 23! Grew up with that beautiful human all of my life, I knew he had issues but not this bad :( I heard that my first cousin was dead at 23 and thought maybe it was a car crash or an accident but my family told me later that day yesterday that he went to our aunts cottage and hung himself with a rope in the shed. My uncle (his FATHER) was the one to find him hanging in the shed along with a note he wrote to them. This was something I could never dream about in my worst nightmare and it’s happened out of the blue. I’ve been crying intensely every few hours thinking about him.

I'm a 28 year old white woman from Michigan. I normally don't think disclosing my skin color is necessary, but it is in this case.

I recently moved in with my mom and my little sister to save money for a house and square up some debt. My mom bought the house last year after she left my sister's dad. He's an alcoholic with a temper problem, so needless to say we were all pretty relieved.

Until Paul.

My mom met Paul in the beer tent last July. My mom thinks Paul is God's gift to earth.

Paul is an alcoholic, racist, homophobic mysogynist and also an opportunist. He recently had to move out of the house he was living in because his parents owned it and they sold the house they were living in to move back into the one paul was. How convenient for paul that he met a woman who had her own house and was just recently single and lonely. 

Last night my 15 year old sister had three friends over. Danielle, Tyler and Thomas. Tyler and Thomas are black. Im sure you can already tell where this is going.

Paul threw a fit because there were ""black people in the backyard.""

Let me remind you, this is my mom's house. Paul just recently moved in, despite none of us knowing him that well, including my mom. My mom who, up until last night, I've always considered to be a decent person.

She stuck up for him. 

I've never been so angry in my entire life. I cry when I'm angry or frustrated so I've been crying a lot. I'm heartbroken for these poor kids having to deal with people like Paul. I'm ashamed of my mom for allowing someone like this to be living at our house. 

I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I'm expecting from this thread. Maybe I just needed to get my words out. I don't know. I don't even want to be at the house. I'm pretty messed up about this.

75,Sick of doing everything online,"For my entire adulthood I have spent an incredible amount online, and it's become less appealing to spend every morning, afternoon, and evening on the internet. Except it's crawled into every area of life, whether it's work, bills, property, hobbies, relationships, studies, anything you can think of is internet-based.

Google might be excellent for finding simple answers to simple questions, like how to cook or fix a piece of electronics. However it is not appropriate to more complex problems, and yet that seems to be all that's left for adults. Human beings are impossible to communicate with now because they want to deal with you online.

Not only is it incredibly stressful to have to manage all your accounts, you've got to do more. Do online courses, work on your self-improvement, concentrate on self-discipline, get an online hustle, there's no end of self-work to manage and self-responsibility to take charge of.

The online job market is completely saturated. Each year it becomes harder to get a job. In 2016, recruiters all told me it was ""hard right now"". Then 2018, and 2019. Then last year, I applied to over 1,000 jobs. For every job that gets posted, the recruiter receives hundreds, if not thousands of applicants. The internet is completely fucking my future career prospects.

And then there's the security aspect. Recently, a hacker managed to penetrate the access to a gmail account, get into my other account, and gain access to literally every bank account, investment account, social media account, utility/provider account, etc. That took weeks to sort out. There are still unauthorized attempts on my personal accounts.

I'm sick of constant online life. At the very least we need a less centralized internet so that you can find information relevant to YOU, it can't continue to be thrown out as a directory of all knowledge that ever existed and people shouldn't be using it as some kind of replacement for everyday life either.",1619555314.0

On top of that, my best friend died of an overdose in January and my toxic friend gets uncomfortable if I ever show emotion surrounding this and acts like my emotions are a burden. She even ghosted me for two weeks and then got angry at me for asking to be included. The only way she decided to talk to me again was when I bought her a gift and begged forgiveness. The problem is, when I started being friends with her, she isolated me from all other people and kept me to herself. If I break off the friendship, I will have no one. I thrive on social contact and my mental health has been on a decline these past few months since she won’t make time for me one on one and refuses to invite me along when she’s hanging out with other friends. I have not hung out with another human being for an extended period of time since the last week of February because anyone I know is friends with her, and they isolate me as well. I have other friends who live out of state who have assured me that it’s not me, and it’s her. I’ve always been there for her whenever she needed me, and now that I need her support, I am the burden.

79,TIL my best friend's common marriage husband is a registered sex offender. How can I begin to process this or talk to her about it?,"Im shaking and finding hard to think, much less type. Im not worried about grammar and im not proof reading. 

What i am doing is desperately seeking advice,  seeing as i am having a hard time keeping my thoughts straight. 

 My back story: at a young age I was raped. Years later I was molested. Year later I was drugged and assaulted at a state fair 4H goat show. No matter how much I stayed home, no matter how much I worried it would happen again, it just did. 3 different people felt entitled to my body.

Our back story: her and I have been friends since 2011, back then she was a bartender and began seeing one of the regulars. Old guy. Today he's 60 and she's 30. I always liked the guy, little quiet but nice and showed relatively normal behavior. The age gap didn't bother me.

If you care: We live Bout an hour away from eachother and don't hang out more than 3/4 times a month. Every now and then we hang out for a weekend. We craft together and most of my supplies are at her house, we were in the process of making/ selling items as partners. I love her she's amazing. Truly a Phoenix from the ashes, she was never cared for in a way most of of would consider standard love from parent to child. But she herself is full of love and care for the people in her life.

Now:  it doesn't usually take me long to google the people I know in my life. Thats the way it is. I dont trust you. I could looooove you. Still don't trust you. Gotta earn that shit over YEARS. 

So needless to say I googled him and there it is, first link, registered sex offender. Not only that but it lists the ages. She was 11 and he was 42. I called the courts and it is a real conviction. Now im beyond angry. 

 I am actually at war with my own brain. Im not an expert, but I keep pushing it out of my mind. I am fighting to keep this in the forefront of my thoughts because I really need to figure out what I'm going to do, I can feel myself trying to protect me... dumb as that sounds.


I dont want to lose her
What if she knows? She knows my history,  would she really let me go over there so often and be around him if she knew? I could kill him with my bare hands.

What if she doesn't know? I  could be ruining her life. I know I have to talk to her about this. She needs to know. But he is everything to her. I mean without him she has no money, no car, no where to live,(of course I will offer her my home) no phone, she owes him everything, when they met she had very little. He paid for her full mouth of implants. Everything. I know they get on eachothers nerves, sometimes she repeatedly tells me she hates him. But it always seems to calm down within the day. 

What will I say? 
The friendship is basically doomed isn't it

UPDATE: she learned about his status a year after they started dating. An offer showed to serve him and she asked what was up. His answer is crazy ex wife accuses him somehow of ""something "" with her son. (Whom I know was 11 due to charges)
It sounds like the same lie they all give.

83,My eyes were opened to the vast meaninglessness of life and now I cant dig myself back out.,"So without going into too much detail I managed to think that I was dying. I genuinely believed my life was over and I finally accepted my death after 20 years of anxiety.

I didnt die obviously and I'm so glad I'm still here. However! 

The time I spent dying was not wasted. I thought a lot during that time and came to a lot of conclusions. 

The greatest one being that life does not matter. Nothing matters and anything that we feel the need to attach meaning to is just our weak brains trying desperately to make us the protagonist of the life we've been living.

84,"Divorce imminent, how to deal with it","30 year old male, married to 31 year old female for 3 years. 

7 months ago life was good. We were trying for a family, we have a 3 year plan to move back to family, etc. 

Then 6 months ago a switch flipped. She wanted to stop trying for a family, distanced herself, latched on to another man (texting only) at unhealthy levels, become emotionally detached, etc. She said she was depressed, and was trying to deal with it, started therapy, we started couples therapy, etc. 

Tonight she told me that she apparently does not feel like we have an intellectual connection, an emotional connection, nor a physical connection (physical obviously tied to the others, two I feel can be worked on, but the intellectual I'm at a loss with how to improve upon). She has completely checked out, doesn't believe we can be fixed and is basically done. 

Not sure how to deal with this as I join the ""just another statistic club"". Don't even know how to cope at this point. Going to couples therapist again tomorrow.

86,I feel like my world is shattering slowly...,"Was in a beautiful long distance relationship with this guy that I've first encountered in my sophomore year of high school and didn't start dating until recently almost 6 months ago. I've dealt with depression for years and was in a nasty relationship where I was gas lighted to no end. He helped me through that relationship towards the end of it where I got back into talking to to him and that group of friends that I had. We had fun and all getting to know each other in the beginning, especially starting to fall in love with each other and date.

Fast forward to today, it's been a week since he wanted to start a break because he wasn't feeling happy to see me and was more anxious about me having panic attacks. (I'm on medication for my depression and I'm currently in the process of getting new ones soon since I feel like my current ones aren't helping me out since I've been getting more panic and anxiety attacks frequently) He says he more importantly wanted me to start healing for myself, since we started dating literally a month after I broke up from my first relationship, and that he wanted me to improve my mental state since it also made him very anxious and on edge. 

I removed him from any contacts that I had with him a few days ago since it hurt me seeing his name and so that I wouldn't be so tempted to message him. It hurts a lot more to me because 2 days before he wanted to tell me that we needed a break, he did not seem so engaged with me like he normally would be at all and wouldn't talk to me on those days. Dealing with depression and horrible anxiety with the addition of the ending of my college semester is making this whole process harder to deal with. I feel overwhelmingly anxious everyday, can't help but cry when I get the chance to, and time seems like it's going slower so I could suffer with my depression more. I slipped up a couple of times and tried to friend request him back and I texted him apologizing that I removed him and hoping that he's ok. But I have not gotten a response from him at all. I didn't expect to get one at all. My brain always assumes the worst and that he probably hates me and doesn't like me anymore since I removed him from different apps. I've been on edge and can't seem to get off of it. I'm starting to slowly lose myself and starting to revert back into being always alone like how I used to before...I try to do the things that kept me occupied before and make me happy but they don't seem to be help me get distracted anymore...",1575007798.0

88,I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t depressed,"I was born into a religious household with immigrated parents (from Vietnam to US). They taught my sibling and I the ways that their parents taught them. It was complete hell. I am one of many asian americans who deal with generational trauma passed down from their parents. 

I wanted to kill myself when i was at the young age of 10. I started to hurt myself in different ways when I was in middle school; whether it was an eating disorder or a blade to my skin. It started when my dad saw that I was into art. I didn’t fit into his admirations of the american dream. 

At the age of 10 he made me gather all of my art supplies and throw them in the trash when I was in the middle of painting a butterfly. He saw that I spent more time drawing than practicing math equations. He often would write down math equations on a white board while I kneeled down for hours. It wasn’t until I finished all of them when I realized that the tough carpet left imprints that led to rashes. 

He forced me to throw away my only sense of pride and joy. The intense feelings of grief, pain, and heartache didn’t matter to him. He makes the rules because it is his job as the “man” of the house. 

That memory replays in my head so often that I feel the loss of my passion all over again. I swear the heartache that i felt when I was a child still feels so present. Even as a 20 year old now, it still won the worse heartbreak I’ve had ever encountered. I lost my trust in those who were supposed to protect me. I lost my confidence because throwing away my art felt like a direct attack of my capabilities. Art was my only escape from the world that I was living in. It was where I felt safe. Art was my escape of the screaming, the fear, and the throbbing pains of being disobedient. 

As my years stacked on, i still had the same feelings. Same emotions, but this time I understood myself more and most importantly, i understood where the abuse from parents stemmed from.

At 19 I was already so suicidal and decided that I did not give a fuck anymore.  That was the best choice ever. I love to sew. I love to paint. I love to knit. I love to design. I can now proudly say that I am an individual with so many talents.

I would say that my parents were the cause of many insecurities of mine. It was hard to believe in myself and I still doubt myself till this day. I do not blame them though, it feels like I can’t. I want to hate them but I can’t because I know that it isn’t their fault either. Generational trauma is really hard for me to know where my feelings lie. 

My father was taught with obedience and fear. He was told to be strong, to not cry, to not share his feelings. This resulted with him not knowing how to express his emotions in a healthy way. It always ended with screaming, broken objects, physical abuse and manipulation. 

It wasnt until he thought that he was on his deathbed when he had the comfortability to show his vulnerability. I am 20 now, and last year was the first time that he told me his true emotions. His near death experience changed him. He was no longer violent towards me but the weight of what he has done crushes my soul daily. 

Over the past couple of years, I dealt with heavy substance abuse. Any substance that I can get ahold of so I won’t feel heartache. I often would think that my inner child is screaming for me to tell her that we are okay. We are alive. We are hurt but it is safe enough now to stop feeling like we always need to be alert . 
I had a good standing of 2 years of sobriety until the COVID stay at home order. I am now battling a year of crippling addiction. Pills, anything I can smoke, and alcohol. Sometimes i felt like I was doing myself a favor because feeling the emotions I felt would be too much. 

My mom, she can be the sweetest person. She also doesn’t know how to express her emotions in a healthy way. 
When COVID stay at home order was put in place,  my dads health also declined. She blamed me for his health for months on end. 
“LOOK AT YOUR DAD. YOU ARE KILLING HIM. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SELFISH. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT HIS HAIR. ITS ALL GONE BECAUSE OF YOU.” 
I would listen to her scream that same mantra of hers weekly, and it’s always because of something that I did.. and that it’s my fault for his unstable health.  I am the scapegoat in my family. 

I am bombarded with guilt from everyone here. Apparently, I am the only one at fault whenever there’s tension in the family or if someone’s health is declining. 

Yet, i freely take their sharp words because I know that they can’t take the same knives that they throw.
 
The blame isn’t on my dad for smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. It is because I stressed him out so much that he has to smoke. 

It’s not because my dad made me fearful to talk to him because the only thing he could let out was a scream. It is because I wasn’t obedient enough, and that made him stab words at me as if they already didn’t already feel like missiles.

Most definitely not because he is incapable to take responsibility for his own guilt that he curated all by himself. The heaviness of guilt is still lingering the sound of his footsteps. I still jump at sounds of someone knocking at the door- and it doesn’t matter how gentle it is because my mind tells me to put on my worn down armor. My mind pounds on own skull as if its trying to warn me of danger.  

In my moms eyes, this is all my doing. In the culture they were raised in, a man can do no wrong. You stand behind your husband. You cook for him. His messes are your messes to clean. You may even work at the same job as your husband but you will never be equal. Its a game you can’t win at but the only way to not lose is to obey. 
 
She defends him with her soul when he swings his pathetic fist at me. Although she defends him she never did partake in the act, but I would feel so much better if she would lay a hand on me. In that case, I wouldnt pity her as much. 

I am in a constant tug o’ war with my feelings of hate and love. I don’t know which emotion is the right emotion. I confuse negative feelings for positive ones. I keep defending every emotion because a part of me hopes for a silver lining in the reality i face. 

If you read everything, thank you. I truly just want to express what I wanted to express.",1619704061.0

96,Really need to find others like me - mutual support needed,"I'm really sorry about the length of this post, but I'd appreciate it so much if you made it all the way through. I can't tl:dr this one. Thanks in advance.

About a year and a half ago, a housemate slipped LSD into my food. Since then I've developed a multitude of mental health problems and I'm now at a point where I'm having trouble dealing with it all. Prior to this happening, I had already having been diagnosed with depression, ptsd, and anxiety.

Immediately after the incident, I experienced my first psychotic episode and, what I believe to have been, several more in the following weeks. I voluntarily admitted myself to a psyche ward after calling the police in the middle of the night because I thought the tweakers across the street were planning to kill me. I was cleared to leave after 24hrs, however, a couple of weeks later I began hearing voices. It started out with them saying ""fuck you"" over and over again in an echo like way - I am still unsure where this came from, however, I did notice these voices all sounded like people I had recently been in contact with in person. Eventually this coalesced into three distinct voices that can dialogue (I can literally converse with them). It's been a long time, but this has held as my reality up to this point.

Up until last month, I hadn't sought help for this nor did I really tell anyone what happened. I initially was hoping it all went away, on top of, having to deal with  simultaneously losing my job and living situation - I actually became homeless for a few months (I used my last check to rent a car to sleep in/drive for Uber and pulled myself out of homelessness after about 3 months). Unfortunately, during that time I noticed that my anxiety had worsened and so had my ptsd. This has shown consistently throughout this past year - I've had two more job losses since then due to this and I get frequent tension headaches, paranoid delusions, and moments of generally not being able to discern between what's real and what's not.

Last month, I decided to finally put serious attention towards doing something about this. In short, my new psychiatrist says I am suffering from drug induced psychosis on top of the previous diagnoses. He prescribed me fluoxetine, latuda, and gabepentin (this last one is because things would get so bad I'd convulse. I actually was convulsing during the LSD trip as well). I haven't started taking them yet because I and my doctor's also think my continued use of nicotine may be the cause of some of this (mostly me) and I'd like to see how it goes if I quit smoking first. The only problem is I'm having a really hard time quitting.

At this point, I feel lost and alone - to an extent, thanks voices! I don't know anyone else dealing with this type of stuff and it's been hard up until now handling it all. My family hasn't really been supportive and are dismissive and I haven't told my friends - I really don't want to tell them the full scope of the problem for fear of judgement.

107,I first posted this on R/Rape and I need a lot of help,"Hello. This post was first posted in r/rape yesterday. However, I really need help. I haven't slept at all and I'm having a meltdown since I don't what to do. I really need help. 

Hello. This is going to be a bit long. So, I apologize for that. I really need help and advice to cope with this situation. I'll be changing the names of my sisters to protect their identities. My older sister will be called Katherine and my little sister will be called Alice. I'm using a Throwaway Account since my older sister is a frequent Reddit User. 

Today, I found out that my little sister, Alice, got touched in the chest when she was sleeping by my older sister's boyfriend. ( Ex-Boyfriend now. ) At the time, I was eating breakfast and using my phone in the kitchen while my older sister, Katherine, was in the bathroom. I didn't hear her scream or anything since the kitchen is really close to the bedroom. However, she ran out from the room and frantically knocked on the bathroom door to talk to my older sister. I had a gut feeling that something was wrong. I asked my sisters if everything was okay but they didn't want to tell me anything. 

Later on, when I was done eating breakfast,  Alice told me what happened. She said that when she was sleeping, Katherine's boyfriend went under her shirt and touched her chest. She's a light sleeper and quickly got up. Alice told me that he sadly apologized, was tired and didn't know it was her. He assumed he was touching Katherine's chest. I don't believe his excuse and I'll explain why later on. 

Also, it needs to be noted that Katherine let's us sleep on her bed when we hangout with her. 

I was heartbroken when she told me. I honestly wanted to go to his bedroom and beat the living crap out of him. ( I still do since he's still in our apartment. ) 

The reason why I don't believe him is because:

1. My little sister is short, really skinny and was wearing green pajamas. 

2. My older sister is tall, plus-sized, and was wearing pink pajamas.

3. When I woke up in the morning to use the bathroom, he was energetic when he saw me in the kitchen. 

4. It was the morning. The TV was on. The Christmas Tree was on. You can see. There is always light in the room. We even leave the lights on at night. There is no excuse. 

5. How do you go under someone's shirt and claim that it was an accident because you're so called tired?

Reddit, I honestly don't know what to do. I'm extremely angry and sad. He's still in the apartment. Katherine already broke up with him and is kicking him out. Alice isn't okay and is blaming herself that they broke up and wishes that she never told any of us. What can I do? I'm having a breakdown. I'm not thinking straight. Half of me is thinking of calling the police and telling them what had happened. However, can someone get arrested for touching someone in the chest if they are so called ""tired""? I don't believe him. I'm not sure what my older sister is thinking. Is kicking him out and not telling the police the right choice? What about my little sister? What do I tell her? She keeps blaming herself even though it's not her fault. Me and Katherine told her it's not her fault. She didn't do anything wrong. Half of me wants to beat him up but I know that it isn't right. It's messed up of me to even think of doing that. It'll make the situation worse. I don't know what to do. 

I'm scared that maybe if Katherine gets a new boyfriend in the future that this will happen again. I'm really scared. Katherine was raped by my dad and Alice just got touched by Katherine's ex-boyfriend. I don't know what to do. I'm really scared. I'm having a meltdown. My fear of men is growing worse and worse now. What do I do, Reddit? I'm sorry for the spelling errors. I'll fix them and update you all later on the situation. I need to cook dinner right now. Thank you for reading. Any help and advice is really appreciated.

Edit - 12:56 A.M. I fixed some grammar errors. I'm very sorry.

Update on the situation - 1:09 A.M. My older sister, Katherine, called her ex-boyfriend's family to pick him up since he has nowhere to go. We don't have any money at the moment since we had to pay some bills and do some grocery shopping. We can't afford to buy him a train ticket to have him go home to his family. Also, he doesn't have any money since he doesn't have a job. His family stated that they were very busy and couldn't pick him up until next Saturday. So, we're stuck with him for this week. I am honestly angry at the moment. I'm not sure what else I can do.

Update on the situation - 1:15 P.M. Katherine had a severe meltdown and started breaking and throwing stuff. Alice is okay and we're hiding in the safe bedroom. I'm not sure what to do. She was verbally fighting with her ex-boyfriend. I want him out if here. Who do I call? There is no one here to help me. I'm really nervous and scared.",1575225808.0

She was like a sister to me, she had 1 failed attempt before she tried again and succeeded.  I knew about the first attempt before she tried again.  I could have visited her to comfort her.  But the cold truth is I didn't.  I figured it was fine, she would get over it, except she didn't.   Ilet her die.  If I has been there, I could of stopped it.  But I wasn't, so I didn't.  But I made a promise to help anyone sad so it would happen to anyone else.  3 years later I put probably 20% more effort then before.  I failed.  Math and video games were my passion.  I am now failing math, and I placed last in a tournament.  I don't want to ask my dad for help with math because he scares me.  When I was little, I decided dad's loud voice was scary, and well, knowing me, I screw up a lot. So I hear the scary voice often.  I also have anger issues, I can get angry real quick, and when I become angry I hurt people, I put a hole in a door.  Ever since I was 14, I have wanted to commit suicide because of the way I felt/feel about my loved one.  I have friends, 1 of them I knew for 9 years, I talk to him about my rage problems, but he doesn't know anything else.  I don't want to tell him, we're best friends, but I don't want to tell him.

112,Lost my 33 year old husband of 16 years due to a heart attack…,"Lost the love of my life, high school sweethearts after spending sixteen years together, he was more than my everything and my entire world. His family besides his biological mother have been a tremendous support system the last few days and our two best friends have taken me in. 

I feel so heartbroken and don’t know how to cope. Everyone around me has shown me so much love and I am sooo grateful. Really I just don’t know what to do or think because my hubbs was my ride or die and we did EVERYTHING together, have never spent a night apart until now that he is gone and have known everything and been on the same page about everything forever. I am broken, numb, my feelings have practically shut down completely.

We got together our junior year of high school and married after we graduated, no kids, just the two of us forever. Now at 33 he had a heart attack in the middle of the night and woke me up during it, I can never imagine getting that image out of my brain, my love, seizing in the bed we built together…

Honestly I’m just trying to see if anyone else has been thru this and how they coped…my best friend and partner is now gone forever. Everyone keeps telling me to hang on and keep going…but at 33 I thought I had my life partner locked down and we had plans for the years ahead.

113,Why does criticism make me want to quit what I'm doing and die?,"TW: mentioning death and wanting to die

Helpful criticism is okay a lot of times. But if I feel like I'm being attacked, I just crash and feel horrible and want to die. My rebuttals are never good enough, and I leave the conversation feeling stupid and bad at doing whatever got criticized. Then I start sobbing and wishing for death because I'm so utterly useless and bad at everything.

It can take hours to get over a particularly hurtful remark.

Constructive criticism is good and okay a lot of the time, but it outweighs the compliments every time.

How do I get over wanting to die every time someone makes me feel bad?",1632793970.0
114,My mom blames every wrongdoings of mine for my dads death,"I am (20F) and it all started 2 years ago  when i had to call an ambulance for my dad. When we visited him in the hospital he flatlined for a couple seconds, then my mom started yelling for the nurses to come and help. After that incident a lot of things have changed within myself and my family. My dad changed his parenting style and he was no longer so strict, Didn’t hit me anymore, no more yelling but rather he would sit me down and talk too me like an adult whenever i did something wrong. I found it so unreal because he used to have a lot of anger problems that led to yelling or hitting me. 

I thought a lot about hypotheticals after the incident like: “what if he did die? and how i never really has a conversation with him and how i never really told him that i loved him since he didn’t say that to me.

My mom, she started being paranoid about my dads health. She would say things like “talk to your dad before its too late”, or do things like making a plate of food and calling me out to the kitchen to give it to him. Then she would come into my room and ask me questions such as: “do you love your dad”? Because apparently i wasn’t showing enough affection after that incident happened. It made me scared to talk to him after, even when i really wanted to, because i always thought... what if that’s the last time that i talked to him. So i didnt out of fear. 

Over the past couple months developed an addiction to substances.. just to feel something other than sadness and these fears that put into me that my dad is dying soon and it’s my responsibility to make him happy. Whenever my dad would try and make a conversation with me, i would suck it up and talk, but after that i would go into my room and cry my eyes out.  Every time i did something wrong my mom would scream bloody murder at me “ THIS IS WHY YOU’RE DAD IS DYING, ITS BECAUSE OF YOU”. And this happened about 60x so far. 

The last time she said it was the worst. My dad knew about my drug addiction this time and for the first time. He talked to me calmly about it trying to ask me what makes me want to use it etc. My mom barges into the space and  yells “YOU STUPID GIRL, LOOK AT YOUR DAD. ARE YOU HAPPY THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS TO YOUR DAD. HE LOST ALL OF HIS HAIR BECAUSE OF YOU AND HE’S GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF YOU. LOOK AT HIM. GO LOOK AT HIM, WHY DO YOU KEEP DOING THIS?? DO YOU WANT HIM TO DIE??” Then continued to hit me.

 I was in a numb state for a couple of days from being shocked. But after those days passed, i was a mess. I disassociated while i was driving but i knew to try my best to park somewhere to freely have a mental breakdown full of crying, screaming, and honestly i don’t remember.

Im afraid to talk to my dad because I’m scared that it will be our last conversation. I feel so guilty because I’m a horrible daughter who creates immense amount of stress to my aging parents. I’m just filled with so much guilt that i cry when i think about it. I cant watch videos or movies where a dad has a great relationship with their daughter because it brings me pain and jealousy. 

I tried explaining my anxiety to my mom but she yelled at me and asked me what i had to be anxious about, “you have everything, a house, food, friends,” and and she’s right. I feel like my problems aren’t real problems in a way like i DO have everything needed to survive and to be successful. Idk",1607807580.0
115,On verge of breakdown - post COVID,"**Context**: I'm 9ish months out from estimated infection date. Still dealing with a roulette of symptoms. Functioning at much lower quality of life. Female in 20s.

I'm sitting in my bathroom on the verge of an emotional breakdown. You know that heavy yet empty feeling in the pit of your stomach? I'm at that stage right now.



**More info if you would like:**

I can barely type this because of how shaky my hands are today. I crawled on all fours to the bathroom because my legs hurt and I'm afraid if collapsing again, and breaking an ankle this time. Mentally I'm operating at maybe 30% of where I was at pre-acute. I have over 60 outstanding medical claims for this year, all COVID related. No treatment plan. No course of action.

I understand the quandary for providers. I do. They're being asked to treat something they have no answers to. But I am a human in pain. I have fallen into a depressive state because of my condition. I worry I will lose my job, being unable to function fully. My in laws don't believe in COVID or racial injustice being a problem (I'm a POC). 

My therapist (whom I sought out earlier this year, because I was told the COVID was actually 'just anxiety') has no appointments available until next month. 

Just.. I don't even know anymore.

119,Follow up: I created a chatbot to help people with anxiety and stress," A while ago I posted about a [chatbot](https://www.iamfeelinganxious.com/) that helps in difficult moments like anxiety, stress and panic, many of you seemed to find it helpful.   

After many of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety.  So we made a [comparison](https://www.pocketcoach.co/blog/anxiety-vs-coronavirus-symptoms/) of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

120,I don't know what to think anymore,"On the third of July me, my dad and my siblings went to my aunt's house for our annual third of july party. now there is never many people there and driving home has never been a problem before. By the end of the night he had only a few beers, like three or four, and he seemed to be only a little tipsy, like usual. He drinks alot at home and we have seen him worse, so its nothing we were concerned about while we where rushing him into the car. We were on the road, only a couple streets down from my aunt's when he suddenly started acting extremely drunk.We were swerving around the road. If not for my sister we would have crashed during those two close calls. We somehow make it home safely, without being pulled over, I was, and still am traumatized, and can't stand being inside a car, let alone while he's driving. I called my gf in the middle of a panic attack, she calmed me down and convinced me to document what happened, gather some evidence of his drinking problem, and text my therapist, scheduling an appointment to talk about it. She talked to my sister's counselor afterwards and decided that  they needed to report it. So far we have had a few meetings with a lady from DCF (idk what it stands for) and we have been assigned a social worker, I haven't met them yet. Now tonight I came back from a friend's birthday party and had to pack my stuff for camping next week, and while I'm packing  at like 12:30 (AM) ish, I was summoned downstairs to do the dishes, as I was doing them dad walkes into the room and starts talking to me about camp and what's going to happen while we are there. I ask him a question, but before he could answer he is interrupted by a call about his uncle Greg. (He is currently sick and living in Montana, (I live in Massachusetts) my dad is working on moving him here and setting him up in a nursing home. Now I have met him once, I didn't like him and he literally started talking to dad a year or two ago) he hangs up the phone after a bit and looks at me like he is going to cry, (I'm not saying that's a bad thing but that is the first time I have seen him that vulnerable) and starts a  monologue about how he hurts when dealing with Greg and it hurts him dealing with the social workers and the chance he might lose us. I ask how I can help, and he said to stop telling the social workers he drinks too much, which he does, and to do my chores more often. I have the feeling he is manipulating me, and I feel guilty because of that. He has had a history of manipulation and emotional abuse of me and my older sister. He has driven me to the point of hoping that we are taken away by the government. Wtf do I do, and should I feel, was he actually manipulating me or am I just a paranoid asshole?

127,My Ex and father of my child being investigated by FBI for soliciting an agent posing as a 13 year old.,"The tl/dr is the title. It’s long and I’m ranting as an attempt at catharsis. This account is a throwaway for privacy and anonymity.

Yesterday Child Protective Services came to my house to interview me and my 12 year old daughter about an FBI investigation regarding my daughter’s father. Apparently he had been having prolonged, inappropriate contact online with an FBI agent posing as a 13 year old girl. He sent sexually explicit messages and pictures AFTER he was lead to believe he was talking to a middle schooler. He set up meetings with the “child” but never showed, and the FBI closed the case when he stopped contact after TWO YEARS.

I don’t know if they will pursue criminal charges or if contacting Child Protective Services is the extent of it. I am shocked on many levels, including the fact that the FBI didn’t contact CPS sooner when my ex has had half-time custody of my daughter this whole time. My ex and I haven’t gotten along great since we broke up, but I never thought he was anything but a good father to our child. Now I can’t stop worrying that he’s done something terrible to her or another kid.

She denies that he ever did anything to her, although she has been more withdrawn and closed off lately. Crazily, she was in her first therapy session for depression when CPS called to set up the appointment to drop this bombshell on us. Lord knows she’s going to need therapy now.

My husband and I just dropped half of our savings on lawyer to get emergency full-time custody. I am not sure how this will pan out, since it’s not clear if he’s actually facing criminal charges. 

Frankly, I am losing my mind. I can’t believe that my daughter’s dad is a fucking pedophile. And that my daughters life is going to get turned upside down because of the pervy, frankly scary shit her dad did. He works in the medical profession and will likely lose his job. I will be stunned if his girlfriend stays with him, and they have been living in her house for 5+years. And although I know my daughter loves him, I’m definitely not letting her be around him unsupervised until she’s 18 if I can help it.

We were always very playful and as i got older and older there was growing sexual tension between us and he was trying new and new things on me. When we plaied he sometimes grabbed my and pulled my under wear down leaving me with naked ass in house or in the garden or he tuched my chest all the time and my sis didnt care at all. This time i was at their house for 3 weeks and yet again he was trying to tuch my ....

It’s still the middle of the night where I am and I just need someone to talk to and help me with the next step. I don’t even know if I’m stable enough emotionally to not burst into tears at work, yet it feels stupid to take the day off because it’s not a human that’s died. 

But I’ve loved this hamster like a mother loves her baby because for the year and a half I’ve had him, he has been my baby. From the moment I brought him home I’ve loved him, gave him a name (I called him Odin because he reminded me of a Norse god, but I also nicknamed him Odie), I set him up in a big fish tank with lots of bedding to snuggle in, he had a nice wheel and all the toys he ever wanted all to himself. 

I’m a grown ass adult but when I brought home a magazine about Vikings, the first thing I did was read it to him because he would just sit on my shoulder and chill with me. 

He was more than a best friend so when I first found his body my emotions just took over and I fell to my knees and screamed and cried. I’ve never felt such intense heartache in my entire life and I’m not even stretching the truth to be dramatic or anything. The pain I feel is both emotional and physical. It’s also really intense and I can’t think straight.

Now I’m trying my best not to cry but everywhere I look I’m reminded of him and I just can’t help but cry. He was alive just yesterday when I got home from work at the end of a grueling week. He was doing the signal for me to pick him up and hold him but my legs were too sore to stand and I was tired. My last words that he ever heard from me were: “not tonight Odie, mommy worked a grueling week and I’m sore and tired. I’ll be able to play with you and hold you tomorrow night though”. 

I think that’s what pains me the most about all this, he died in his sleep with the last words he ever heard from me telling him that I was too tired to interact with him because he never woke up at his usual time. I just hope that wherever he is now, he knows that I loved him from the first moment I laid eyes on him and that even when I couldn’t see him, I was always thinking about his sweet little face.",1620544079.0
131,Anyone else experiencing cancer during covid? I'm nervous about waiting for my operation & radiation.,"Hi, I was diagnosed with breast cancer almost a month ago now & was supposed to have my operation today, but that was pushed back to Dec 8th because there were two more spots that my oncologist wanted to get further biopsies on. I am grateful that operations are happening at all & am hoping that this continues for those of us awaiting life saving surgery. I'll find out Thurs about that, which means I find out if I get to keep my breast instead of losing the tumour & some lymph nodes.

The other stressor added to this is that I am not allowed to get covid if I am to have an operation. I'm very lucky to have a spouse who is being supportive & is sleeping downstairs while all of this is going on & I've had to take my 14 yr old out of in person school, so I'm grateful to have a kid who is also being supportive & understanding about all of this.

Just posting to help relieve some stress. I hope that if someone else is going through this that they are able to get the help they need. Being sick with cancer during a pandemic is definitely a unique experience.",1606234373.0

134,"I miss my cat so badly that every time I think about him, or cats in general, I almost cry.","He's not dead, and he didn't have to be re-homed for any reason, but *I* did. For a very important reason. 

There's gonna be a whole lotta words below this, because I need to vent, so here's a TL;DR: For the sake of my mental and physical health I had to high-tail it out of my family home, leaving behind my darling cat who was basically my best friend. 

For 3 years, since I was 17, I've had a serious problem with alcohol. Like, everyday I would drink until I threw up and then continue drinking until I blacked out. It started with taking vodka to school in a water bottle to deal with my social anxiety, but bled into every other malady and memory Id rather not have and slowly took over what only the most generous souls would have called my life. I was getting most of that alcohol from the family members I was living with, sometimes with money I'd give them to buy it on my behalf (I'm based in the USA so even very recently at 20 I still can't buy it directly), sometimes having their own booze shared with me, and, other times, very regrettably, stealing theirs- which I intend to start paying back for as soon as I have steady employment. 

Despite my consistent begging for alcohol to be hidden from me, locked up, or otherwise made  inaccessible (for instance, I'm 5'2"" and not very inventive, so high shelves are still a very effective way to keep me out of things), for my requests to have any of theirs or to have any purchased for me through them to be refused, none of those things ever happened, which, given the intergenerational layers of mental illness, abuse, co-dependency, and generalized bullshit in which I was born and raised, isn't all that surprising. 

I didn't have anywhere else to go, couldn't afford rehab (and have had absolutely horrifying experiences with mental healthcare in the past that had scared me off the idea of ever entering inpatient treatment again anyway), and, due to some unfavorable circumstances like on going verbal abuse and lingering memories of other sorts of abuse, an inability to work and thus move out due to being in a very rural and spread out public transportation desert, and a generally pessimistic world view, I didn't feel like I wanted to or could quit. 

Then, a few months ago, all at once and entirely out of nowhere, I fell directly into the laps of a large and sturdy group of wonderful, fun, kind people who rather quickly reminded me that the world and living in it can be beautiful things, and slowly started working on quitting drinking but got caught in a pattern of getting halfway through a taper and losing my resolve, usually while surrounded by the rampant drinking and toxic verbal exchanges going on at home, and backsliding. Rinse and repeat. 

A couple of months into this new happiness and hope, a bad binge landed me in the ER where they told me I have early alcoholic liver disease. 

A couple of months ago I would have thought this was great news, but now, it scared me. With refreshed determination I again began a taper, but having no day-to-day support and the knowledge that all I had to do was ask to get a drink, I didn't get far. 

Another month later, plateaued at 6 drinks a day (down from 12), I indulged in yet another bad binge. 

And that scared the shit out of me. 

I knew I couldn't stop on my own long before that, but I finally accepted that my family wasn't going to help me. 

And that hurt.

But, I had other places I could go now, and so I reached out and got out. I brought along my then-currant/now-final bottle of vodka for the taper, as in the ER they'd also told me that given my degree of dependency and other health issues quitting cold would be dangerous, which was placed up on- GASP- a high shelf and dolled out to me on a rigid, absolute, no-matter-how-much-I-begged schedule. The patience and kindness of a very dear friend and his accommodating parents saved my life. 

In 8 days, I was sober. 

I am now 5 days sober and full of optimism. Where I'm staying, I am more welcome than I ever was at home. I am now close enough to places of work to travel to by foot or bike, and there are even some buses in this town, so I can now find a job, work on getting my GED without constant verbal degradation and screaming distracting me, find hobbies, and generally just figure out who I am, all while enjoying time with great people. 

The only thing- the one and only thing- that I miss about home is my beloved rescue cat, a rather large and buttheadish baby with the silkiest black fur and biggest green eyes you'll ever see. His name is Bowie, after Mr. Stardust himself. He knows when I'm sad and would come to would comfort me. He slept against my chest every night. He starts purring the moment I enter the same room as him. He pretty much solely carried me through the last two years of my life. 

But I couldn't bring him with me when I left. 

It broke my heart, and it breaks my heart knowing he doesn't have any idea why I suddenly left him. 

I'm welling up as I write this. 

I try to focus on all the bad I left behind, but I miss that little beacon of love so damn much.",1600310138.0
135,"I (f, 22) lost my virginity casually, feel worthless","I lost my virginity to a guy that I had not know long, it was our third time meeting. I didn’t really intend on losing it to him, I didn’t even fancy him, I just enjoyed the attention I got from him (and I was very lonely at the time). 
About 8/9 months has passed now, I have been having sex with him intermittently and we  hang out and text. I know him more now. Turns out, When he first approached me, I was one of three girls he approached that day. He is always talking and having sex with different women. There are times where he is not talking to other women, I have come to realise that these were the times he payed more attention to me. 

There was never any deception really on his part. He was always open with me that he sees other women ( although I didn’t realise the full extent of it till now). It didn’t bother me at first because I didn’t like him. But now I am attached, and almost addicted to his attention. 

I am only now, truly learning, that I never meant anything more to him than a bit of fun, and that kills. 

I feel absolutely worthless. All I want is his attention.

I’m not in love with him in the slightest. I don’t even know what I want from him, other than his approval/attention.

I am also struggling with the fact that I am no longer a virgin, and future guys will think less of me. I think this is the hardest thing, because even if I get over him, I can never take back the sex. I resent him for this.

Then at the end of the call she told my dad who told me that her husband took photos of me and my sister (probably between the ages of 3-11) and then photoshopped them inappropriately in order to get off.

145,Trying to cope with shame and self-hatred after a disappointing first time having sex.,"Due to terrible self-esteem issues and growing up in a religious household, I had avoided dating and sex until I was 25. When I turned 25, I decided I had to lose my virginity this year. I know it's completely irrational, but I've desperately wanted to be normal all my life and felt like I had to reach this one milestone and then I'll be ""more normal"". My self-esteem was just as shit as it had been in the past, but I figured it'd be worth it in the end.

I went online. At this point, I felt disillusioned with the idea of finding a relationship with someone who would cherish me and love me, so I decided to find someone solely for the purpose of losing my virginity.

I matched with this guy in December. I asked him what he was looking for and he said ""someone to keep me warm in these winter nights."" I know it's a sleazy line, but it appealed to me in that moment, because I desperately wanted to feel someone's arms around me. We met up at a restaurant. He made me laugh, he called me ""really beautiful,"" and asked me some personal questions. However, he did mention that he couldn't date me because of religious/family obligations. I said I was fine with it as I was mainly looking for a physical connection. Afterwards we went to his place to make out. It was my first time really making out with someone and it was really nice. However, he was quite a bit rough with me, asked if he could slap me, and I had bruised lips when I came home, which bothered me. He did not pressure me for sex, though, as he knew I was a virgin and wanted to take things slow.

He texted me the next day saying how much fun he had. I thanked him for the experience, but had no intention to meet up with him again because of the slight discomfort I felt.

Over the next couple weeks, he would ask me to hang out and I would say no. Finally, I told him I wanted to wait for the right person. He said he understood.

Flash forward a month - I'm feeling pretty horny, and I look down at my phone to see a text from him. He tells me he's alone at his place and that if I changed my mind, I should come over.

Well, I did go over. This time was fun, too, and he even got me to orgasm, but he did some stuff that made me feel uncomfortable again - like light choking and holding me down (in a playful way) when I asked to leave.  Stuff that we didn't discuss.

After I went home, I told him I didn't want to see him again because of his aggressive style. He became very upset, and apologized that I ""felt that way."" He told me how attracted he was to me and how he wanted to do things better. I caved. I knew I shouldn't have, but I caved and said that I wouldn't mind seeing him again if we had better communication.

I met up with him for the third and last time. I really wanted to lose my virginity. I was over it.

The first thing he asks me after starting to kiss is ""do you want to try fucking?"" I just say ""yeah, I mean I was thinking about it."" He then proceeds to rush into it. I asked him ""Can you let me warm up first"" and he was like ""I just want to try while I'm hard"" and I said ""Ok""

He went in and it hurt - a lot. I told him this, but he just kept going. I told him ""stop"" and he just said ""wait, I'm really close to coming"" and that was it. It lasted maybe 3-4 minutes total. He lay down and pulled me towards him. He told me how we would try things differently next time, but his ideas didn't involve more foreplay. After some awkward conversation, I told him I had to leave. He gave me a goodbye kiss, and said ""I'm not gonna get any weird texts after this, am I?"" in reference to my ""aggressive style"" text. I mumbled no and left.

I did not contact him after. I wanted to forget him and the whole experience. I didn't care if I heard back from him or not. But he did reach out. 2 WEEKS after we had sex. I didn't have the heart to respond.

He also texted me recently trying to get me to come over in a state-wide lockdown. I honestly just wish he'd disappear from my memory and I could go back to being a clueless virgin.

**TL;DR: Met up with a guy who I knew didn't care about me or my comfort 3 times because I was desperate and lonely (3rd time culminating in losing my virginity), only to be ignored for 2 weeks and then toyed with during quarantine. I now feel deeply ashamed and angry at myself for letting this person have access to my body. Can't find a way to cope with this sadness and guilt.**",1586420257.0

148,I can't cope; 20 lost virginity to a brothel,"I need your advice and opinions please; so I turned 20 and decided to go clubbing the same week. I had no plans on a prostitute, I was set on losing it with someone on my own skill. Its not like I couldn't get laid, Ive had opportunities and Im pretty outgoing I have allot of friends; Ive been on 3-4 dates and such but sex just never occured. 

Im at Uni working part-time; with a big hobby (singing) and I just didn't try or think about girls. Honeslty my virginity did not bother me one bit and I was busy putting effort/time in other areas.

So the clubbing day occured; and untill then I haven't done anything sexual. I hadn't even had my first kiss or first time (note I don't care). We had an airbnb and I had been chatting with a tinder girl for a few days; I invited her and she says Im comming. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT; but then she changed her mind and I got stood up; she didnt show up and even though we talked for like 5 days she unmatched me. 

After that I was kinda down and started drinking with my mates; one of my friends passed out and went to bed. Then for some reason, even though I was against it; the majority wanted to hit a strip club, I didn't want to go but I also didn't care so I went. I had 2 lap dances (as a birthday gift); I was gone. My brain was gone, the second chick was amazing, I slapped ass and tits while she was on me; tits in your face; her perfume smelt amazing. I don't regret this, I wouldn't write this post if I went home after this. But it continued...

Then we went clubbing, had a bit to drink and once my friends went back to the airbnb, I was feeling the music so I stayed danced a bit and tried hitting on girls at the club. At 3am I decided its time I go home; but maybe before I go I could get 1 more lap dance???

(Before I go on, Im in Australia; brothels are legal)

I got 2 lap dances, $80 bucks. I then without hesitation booked an Uber to a brothel. And drunk me told the driver Im going home after a good night; he looked at the map it said brothel lmao, It was funny but awkward, he judged the fuck out of me. I got there and it happened; she asked me where do you wanna start I said mouth pointing down as in I wanna give her head but then she kissed me. I didnt want to kiss her; I didn't want my first kiss to be at a brothel... But after that I was drunk so I kept going, kept making out, did all of it the whole shebang.

I went back to the airbnb and had an hour to myself, I become sober and what happened hit me... I was nearly suicidal. I opened up to one best friend, to my surprise he opened up and told me he lost his virginity to a brothel too (not importent but he has a girlfriend now).

The only way I can cope with this (I know its stupid) is by thinking that idiot wasn't me. That horny, drunk dumbass lost his virginity; I still had mine. I can still have my first kiss, my first sexual experience; I still can... My story doesn't have this writtin forever untill I die... I still have a chance...

(Btw I stopped drinking completely, I hate it now)

Thats the only way I can cope; I know I should enjoy losing my virginity but it haunts me. I dont know why? Maybe I don't see myself as a main charecter of a movie anymore, after this I felt like a side charecter (if that made any sense)... 

Please let me know your opinion and is it ok for me to think this way. Do I still have my first kiss waiting out there...",1578960908.0

No one seems to want to help me and everywhere I turn things just get worse and worse I don’t know what to do anymore and every last friend I’ve got has abandoned me I’m completely alone freezing cold starving hungry without a penny to my name..

And I’m too scared to turn to the authorities I just don’t know what to do I think I might end up dead because it’s so cold and I’ve got pets with me and I love them and I can’t give them up because they guarding me and keeping me warm...

154,I think I just need to tell people this,"In november last year I met up with a girl I had a crush on in high school. When we knew eachother in high school a lot of bad things had happened that I need to explain.

Basically a group of us were very depressed, had messed up lives etc. And would make comments about committing suicide with like a gallows humor. Eventually someone had the ridiculous idea of the world finding humor in our deaths. A girl with a lot of influence told us a story of us all eating poisonous muffins and being found in the gymnasium; death by muffins.

For whatever reason this stuck with everyone and became a plan I honestly never knew if anyone was serious about. I went along with it if I'm being honest. It became a thing that let you know someone else had those thoughts of ending their life without having to exactly tell someone they had them. Just ""do you like muffins"" with a wink. It was so stupid and so hard to explain to people the mentality we all had, but I need to stress it was never to harm anyone else, atleast as far as i knew.

I dont remember when it happened, but it was my grade 9 year. I'm 28 now. the school was in canada, Ontario. Ernestown secondary school. I guess one of the girls from the group wrote an email to the school listing who they where going to kill. Listing how they were going to kill them. Listing the reasons and a date to expect the attempt. 

I didnt know about any of that when they pulled me into the office with the cops. I was shaking, sweating, I didnt understand what was going on. When they told me I confessed to the suicidal thoughts and jokes and the group but that I no idea about anything they were saying we wanted to do. I didnt want to hurt anyone and I didnt think anyone else did. This was about us not the school. But i was wrong..

I guess the girl with the influence sent the email. She listed things like hanging decapitated staff members from door frames to watch the blood drain, just really messed up stuff. She had a map of the school and I guess in the email as far as I gathered from the interrogation with the cops she said she had weapons. It made national news. The cops ended up going after 2 girls.. that's important I guess.

Flash forward a couple years, I'm sitting in a parking lot and i see her. It's the main girl. I called her name and she turns and looks terrified to see me. A few days later she messaged me on MSN if anyone remembers that and says she wants to see me and she was sorry. She was told not to talk to anyone from back then. She told me that everyone had set her up and that she never wrote that letter. The other girl accused did but my statement was the only statement that was true in court. 

We spent like 8 years together. In the beginning everything was amazing and I would literally do anything for her. I remember i walked like 9 km in the snow just to see her like every other night. I use to think it was things like that, being willing to give everything for a person you care about that would make a difference later in life. 

I made mistakes. She would lie to me a lot but I wouldnt question her. She had this ability to look me straight in the eyes and make me believe anything she said. All I wanted was to fight for us. To the point where I would fight myself. She would manipulate a situation constantly. To fully explain the truth of that relationship is something I cant exactly do. It makes me feel weak and pathetic to explain every detail and mistake I made but in the end she was with someone else majority of the time. For 3 years I had given her my bank card and let her delegate but she had just taken everything claiming it was going toward debt for university she was never actually in.

After I managed to walk away from her i was messed up. I couldn't commit in any relationships. For a long time.i didnt really feel anything for anyone until I met her online.. the other girl. 

The moment she messaged me the thought popped in my head. Everything she use to tell me.. she use to just look me in the eyes and tell me and I would believe her. I never even questioned that she had lied about writing the email to the school all those years ago. She had me convinced that it was girl #2 and she was completely innocent just like me. So in my crazy messed up mind everything flipped. Girl #2 was the one set up.. 

So at this point in life I was probably best described as completely vulnerable and stupid. When I meet up with girl #2 the very first night I tell her everything, I tell before she even tells me that girl #1 pretended for like 8 years to want a family with me and be with me and have this life while having other plans the whole time and my trust issues, but how I believe that she (girl #2) was really the one set up.

Literally week like 3 of that relationship girl #2 gets pregnant, were moving like insanely fast and I'm like happier then I've ever been. We have plans to move in together and her current kids already love me. Until a day before I move out of my own place. 

She tells me I cant live with her and we get in a fight because she wasnt making sense. I had no where to live other then my parents on such short notice so I decided to start living in my car. Every month we would talk and agree on getting a place and every week or so later she would pick a fight and back out. All the while blaming me for arguing with a pregnant woman. 

I lived through the winter in my car. December to october. I worked everyday and went to the gym every morning to run and shower just for like stress. 

September first was like the last chance for me. Looking back I have no excuses for being homeless. I should have gotten my own place and focused on myself but I held out and prayed she would commit. I needed to be around my son and be there for him everyday. That was all I really cared about. But she backed out again so I started looking for a place for joint custody.

Its September 27 and its 2 days past the due date of my son. Things between her and I have gotten worse and better like they do and she promised me I could.be there. I never once changed my stance on how i felt about being dad. It was like the only thing I held on to anymore. I would call the hospital at night. Scared maybe she didnt have a chance to call me but really being scared that I would miss it. That she didnt really want me there despite everything she had ever told me. I call the hospital and give her name... shes there having him.

I rush to the hospital and run up the ramp. I've been to every appointment and know exactly where to go. As I run in the front door I see her ex.. 

The father of her current kids. The one she wasnt with anymore standing there telling me I had better leave or something bad was going to happen. That it wasnt mine and I had no right to be there. It was the first time I heard any of it. I followed him trying to be calm constantly thinking now what if he is mine, what if this guy wants me to get arrested so I'm not there for him. I asked him what he ment. I told him her and I had slept together 3 days ago. She told me you were her ex husband. I've been to every appointment. He doesn't listen to anything I say and just continues to scream at me to leave. So I called him stupid and walked in front of security. I dont exactly respect myself for doing it but I needed him out of the situation now. He charged me and security grabbed him and the cops took him away. 

When I went upstairs she was there. She had already had him an hour ago. The same time she texted me telling me she was going to sleep. She lied to the very end. I looked at him and didnt think he looked like me. I knew the other guys kids, he was native, I'm not. It was his son not mine. I've had that confirmed since. And the second she knew that she pretended like I was crazy for ever think it was. That I was a crazy person she had never slept with. And that she loved her husband. She told me that I was a horrible person. 

I think I'm like super messed up now and shouldn't be with anyone but I'm so completely loney all the time. I wake up from nightmares of blonde haired blue eyed babies that never existed and the feeling that I'm probably ment to be alone not to be all like melodramatic or narcissistic but I think I'm more messed up then other people...",1571056989.0
155,Predator has left me out of options... please help me,"TW: SEXUAL ABUSE 

Hello redditors...

This really fucking hurts me to write but i need to get this out in hopes that I can get some feedback to handle this situation.

I am completely lost.

This story is about my grandpa. I looked up to him as a teen because he painted pictures, collected strange things from the dump and smoked weed. I grew up idolizing my grandparents and hating my mom because she was crazy and made of stone. She had absolutely no respect for me or my siblings and treated us pretty bad. So much so that our relationship is permanently damaged and I cant seem to find a way to fix it. Now i see why my mom has always been so emotionless and mentally fucked.

I found out that my grandpa spent years sexually abusing my mom. She spoke up and nobody believed her. The same way she didnt believe me when it happened to me.

This pattern is generational. My grandma told me our family is ""cursed"" because the oldest daughter for generations has always been molested. You'd think knowing that information that your family would *maybe* believe you when it happens but that is not the case here. 

My grandpa has made sexual advancements on my aunts, cousins, and my grandmas friends as well. My male cousin came out and admitted that my grandpa rubbed his thigh sexually when he was only 10. My 14 year old sister came out and said that when she was in middle school, he rubbed her thigh the same way. He also put his junk in her face when she was a toddler looking into the fridge. I just found that part out this year. 

All of these stories about this sick man are surfacing, and the worst part is several members of my family live only a few blocks away from the house he lives in which is the house my mom and all of us grew up in.
My grandma left him but she moved further away and is selling him the house that remains right in between all of ours. Why? I have no idea. Shes fucked up too and doesnt seem to realize or care that letting him live there is affecting several of my family members.

In 2016 he started making sexual advancements towards my 2nd oldest sister (I am the oldest). He once told her she was sexy
February 2016 she caught him jerking off on her underwear in the kitchen of his house. She broke down and told my mom, who also broke down and cried.
My mom started reliving her childhood trauma.. telling us she was going to kill herself and was physically harming her body and was put into a mental hospital. My mom is undergoing serious counseling and my sister is a wreck.

When my grandma asked him if he was abusing my mom (in the 80s) he said ""well if she said i did, then i guess i did""

When my grandpa was asked by my cousin why he was jerking off on my sisters underwear, his response was ""well, some weed makes you happy, some weed makes you horny"". 

he blamed my mother for his abuse. He would tell her when she was little that she was the reason he smoked. 

My little sister (the 14 year old) walks home from school every day, and the bus drops her off on his cross streets. It terrifies everyone in my family that he could find her walking one day and seriously hurt her. He is a predator. He often works on peoples houses within his own neighborhood, and one woman saw him on the bike path and started crying and yelling at him in front of my grandma a few years back. When my grandma asked him why, he said ""just ignore her, shes crazy"". 


I don't know how to report it to the police since i have no physical proof of the matter besides a psychologically fucked up family. Family members have reported seeing him in stores and driving around the area. It is fucking hell living in fear of seeing him because I'm scared of how I will react.

I desperately want him arrested and removed from the neighborhood or to be put on the registry but everyone in my family is too scared to testify. 

Watching everyone slowly recovering from the trauma hes inflicted is KILLING me. It's making me want to do horrible things to him and I'm starting to wonder if the fact I could be put in prison is worth the risk of saving my family.

I am the oldest daughter and I have spent my entire life taking care of my siblings with an absent abusive alcoholic father a mentally abusive mother. I cant keep everyone safe without hurting the guy, and I cant have him put in prison when nobody is willing to speak up about the abuse.

I'm losing my mind trying to come up with a solution... if anyone has any experience, feedback or ANYTHING at all I would appreciate it more than you know.

If you made it this far, thank you so much for listening to my story.",1555011850.0

157,Coming to the realization that I will likely have to become my disabled sister's caretaker when my mother passes away.,"My sister has an IQ of 71. That's one point above the cutoff to be considered mentally retarded, thus she does not qualify for a lot of aid/services. She has the intelligence and personality of a 12-year-old, but she also has some nasty personality traits that multiple therapists/counselors/psychologists have failed to help. She steals from her own family members - money, food, medication, random items, and will lie about it in the face of proof. When confronted she cries, acts victimized, and claims that the accuser is a bully. She is 31 years old. You can't imagine the frustration. My parents don't make much money, and their health is in decline. I have three other mentally sound siblings - none of them have degrees, aspirations, or a sense of responsibility. The task of caring for my sister is going to fall to me.

I don't know what to do. I cannot support a compulsive thief and liar under my roof when I have plans for my own future, my own family. But I do love my sister, despite all of the turmoil she's caused; afterall is it really her fault she is this way? When my parents pass away, it will sever the tie my other siblings have to her; they merely tolerate her because she lives at home and they are forced to see her and interact with her when they are here. Their relationship with her does not go beyond a temporary obligation to acknowledge her existence as long as she is living with my mom. Once mom goes, so do they. It's so, so, unbearably sad. If I couldn't care for her but found an institution for her to stay, no one would visit her. We'd all forget about my sister. And we'd try to justify it by recalling all of her transgressions. She stole from me, therefore I have a right to not feel bad about abandoning her. My siblings would probably be able to rationalize away the guilt but I can't live like that. That's only if I could afford to place her in someone else's care. Even then, I'd worry about how she's being treated, because everyone has heard stories. I would try to visit her, but it would be awkward because our relationship is strained and we have nothing in common. 

What can you do? Whether she stays with me in my own home or finds space in an institution, I will never be rid of the worry and stress that comes with accepting what was formerly my parents' burden. And it's a huge, heavy, monstrous burden. One that I never expected I'd inherit until now. I can feel nothing but dread. I try to keep myself busy and meditate to cope but it's not enough to face the reality that this a permanent, til-the-day-I-die type of situation. There's no way out.",1505779230.0

159,"My grandpa is a hoarder, I just moved in with him. I started helping him clean his house, and now I'm traumatized.","Hello, please don't penalize me for the grammar. I'm very upset and kind of shaky, and I just want to get this off of my chest. I(F18), now live with my grandfather whom is in his late 70's. Ever since I was born, he has been known as a hoarder, but not to the extent it is at now. He doesn't clean. He claims that its the new upstairs neighbors fault for bringing all of the roaches in his house. But, its far from the truth. See, he has not cleaned his house thoroughly in years. Ever since I moved out, but to humble myself, maybe he hasn't cleaned after my father died. My father died of AIDS he got it from my mother whom didn't tell him or they were too caught up in the moment as druggies. My grandpa is a Vietnam vet, and he has held his feelings in for long as I could remember. He wouldn't ever really get angry, sad, or too happy. He always kept it neutral or showed a slit tinge of another emotion. But, I think my father dying did have effect on him, as well as my uncles and my neighborhood grandmother has died during the pandemic. His house is filled to the brim with liquor bottles, empty ones too. And I'm worried.

Now that I have all of that explained to the best of my ability, I'm scared to live in this house even though I'm cleaning it little by little with my grandfather. But, the deeper I clean, the more roaches I find. Its a colony. Its an infestation! It seems like they have been there for such a long time. It wasn't the neighbors. They aren't nasty. He is. Majority of all of his seasoning were expired. His food was expired. His condiments were expired. Even his plastic that held some stuff. Its not like these foods were a year expired. I'm talking from the farthest back was 2004. I'm disgusted. I'm ACTUALLY traumatized from seeing so much bugs. Them crawling out of places he uses on the daily. Seeing them show themselves, appear, skitter around in the kitchen. And the worst of all, there were millions of roach legs on his pots and pans. That littered the bottom cabinet. There were dead roaches that you could tell has been there for years. The smell. The look. The feeling through the gloves as I scrubbed my old man's cabinets and counters. They were under the microwave, in the wooden knife holder, In the cabinets, the cups, the bowls, EVERYTHING. There was so much food littering the cabinet too that has attracted all of these roaches. He claims he didn't know he was infested.

Guys, please. I'm terrified. Every time I go to sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night itching, feeling crawling on my skin. Seeing bugs that aren't there. Hearing flies in my ears when they aren't there at all. I feel dirty, like my skin is layered with dirt, but it is not. I take two baths a day. I get nervous about any little litter or trash in my room. Or any spec of dirt I see anywhere that I have no idea where it came from. I hate bugs. I have always been afraid of them and very phobic. I sucked it up to help my grandpa who was in need, but at the cost of my sanity. At the cost of my psychosis that I had when my father died, now maybe trickling back at this next traumatizing event from the many others. I get that people go through worse, but this is my worse experience in cleaning and messes. I want to cry so bad, my grandpa needs help, but I don't have the strength to endure this any longer.

My solution is by working a lot while I am in college to get as much promotions as I could to make enough money to even try to split the rent with my boyfriend and his roommate. And then using my degree to get a much better and full-time job and work on moving out before I may go to med school.

And please, do not insult my grandfather. He is old, a war vet, a divorced man, a hoarder, and a man who lost his mother too early. I love him, but this is a lot for me.

Any advice? Or even any help in what I should do?

161,My boyfriend (26M) passed away and in the aftermath I found out he was moving in with his high school sweetheart in the aftermath.,"So a little bit of context - I (25F) have been in an on and off relationship with my college sweetheart for the past 6 years. The last three years of this relationship has been maintained long distance.

My boyfriend and I had a volatile past over the past 6 years, and we had been best friends the year prior to that as well. Our relationship has always been riddled with lies, cheating, and toxicity, and he has been terribly verbally and physically abusive in the earlier years of our relationship, but recently everything had finally started falling into place. This past July, we had gotten to see each other for the first time since the summer of 2019 due to our long distance relationship and COVID-19. He drove all the way across the country and stayed with me for 6 weeks and even helped me move into my own first apartment.

Three weeks ago, I found out he committed suicide when he hadn't texted me back for a few days and I googled his name and found an obituary. When his dad reached out to me and shared the news, he told me he hadn't known we were back together, that he didn't know that we were making plans to buy property, I was going to quit my job and move out west, we were going to elope and start a life new and fresh, away from everyone we knew, away from all the buzz. Three days before it happened, I had just got my GMAT test prep books so I could start prepping for grad school and move out west. His dad had told me he had no clue that we had been back together and had told me he was moving across the country with his high school girlfriend.

Now here's the thing - I'm not going to go into the complicated nature of my relationship but essentially none of our friends have known we've been maintaining a relationship for the past 5 years since our initial breakup because they'd flip their shit if they found out. We've essentially kept everything a secret. I am mourning totally alone. I've dealt with my fair share of trauma - abuse, drug and alcohol addiction, rape, I can keep the list going but I won't. But in all of those situations, I always knew what to do, I always knew how to get out of it and continue on. This time I don't know what to do. Can someone please advise me? I have no idea how to deal with any of this and I am just devastated and confused and hurt and I feel like my future just fell apart. I want to quit my job and just sulk and amount to nothing ultimately. I fought and fought and fought for years for this relationship and I guess now it's really all for naught. I feel helpless and don't know how to move forward. Please help. I'm so young and feel like I have had my whole life taken away from me. I'm only 25 and have a VP position and one of the biggest banks in the whole world and I'm willing to give that all up because I feel like I can't function right now.

  Young ( fake name) was a loving and caring soul. He was so much fun to be around , and the smartest person I know. He would help me study algebra and Korean. Although he was an only child he had the biggest heart. Whenever I needed something he was there . I remember when he found out about periods , he was mortified lol, he carried pads around for me and would always lend his hoodie if I needed.

  My friends used to call us a 'power couple'. Emmoa was his mother she had the biggest heart . she knew my living situation and would always be kind and make lunches for me. His ( Appa) father was a strict stern man the typical Asian dad . But he always had a soft spot for me and would invite me to dinners . He moved to Korea a year before middle school graduation . Graduation was a week ago about 5 days after his death. I have to go into highschool alone with out him.

   I would teach him kpop dances he wanted to learn even when he was in Korea. I would hold him and sing into the new world ( girls generation) when he would have panic attacks. If I could kiss him on his forhead one more time, or brush his black hair into little pig tails I would. I got the call from his mother that he killed himself. I new he had those thoughts , so do I ,yet I never thought he would do it before me. I think I rambling but I miss him and I'm happy if you made it this far. I want to end this with our favorite saying
 ""The world is cruel yet very beautiful""

If anyone has advice on how to move on I'd love to hear it or anything to get my mind off of it . I wish I had parents who would care . if anyone has advice or went through the same thing please help. Really anything even if it had nothing to do with this post.",1624068144.0

167,I hate my fucking job,"TLDR: I'm too sensitive to be working in fast food but too ""unskilled"" to work anywhere else.

A couple of months ago, I got my first job, and at first, it was great; great for my self esteem, great for filling up my days (I don't really have any hobbies so boredom is a big issue for me), great for my previously non-existent finances... just great. But now it's just exhausting. Being yelled at, demeaned, and degraded for things I have absolutely no control over (corporate changing up the menu, the time it takes *only 3 people* to make *literally thirty-six tacos* during the dinner rush, the price of menu items, etc etc etc) is taking a toll on me. I come home most days and just lay down and cry. 

Changing jobs isn't an option for me. Even trade schools expect you to have a high school diploma in order to enroll. This is it for me, and in between the mean customers there's plenty of nice or at least decent ones, and sometimes I actually have a lot of fun at work, so it's not apocalyptic or anything, but it's still hard and discouraging.

168,My friend has attachment issues. I want to deattach our friendship.,"I feel so guilty saying this, but my friend has anxiety of people leaving her and has severe depression. The problem is I had planned to cut ties with her. She is far too clingy and obsessive for me to handle. Every topic is about the shows she watches and story podcasts she listens to. Nothing else. When I try to steer the conversation to literally anything else, she has little to nothing to say. She watches the same show eight times, but can't be bothered to be informed about the world around her. Plus, I can't work with her as she gets distracted too easily and I have to bring her back on task. Her terrible hygiene doesn't help her case either. I feel like her mom, not her friend. Every time I spend time with her, I leave her house feeling exhausted and burnt out. It doesn't help that she needs extensive help with her academic work, but I also need to get mine done.

169,Cope with being written up at work,"TW: self harm



So I was having an anxiety attack and fled work to my car without telling anyone to try to calm down, but I ended up harming myself and I had to call Crisis, etc. Bottom line, I was MIA for about an hour and a half

Understandably, my higher ups were upset because not only of my own destructive tendencies, but ""what if the building was on fire?"" and ""people had to leave their jobs to find you"" So I learned my lesson, if I'm going to flee, to let someone know

But now I'm getting written up for it. One and final warning. Don't flee like that again or you'll be terminated

So now I'm super anxious again, I'm paranoid that I'm going to do something else to fuck up and get fired. I don't know how to cope with this lingering fear of termination. What can I do?",1605557469.0

We’ve been broken up for a long time now. She’s moved on. But I can’t stop thinking about her. I can’t move on. I’m still so in love with her, it hurts. If the pandemic wasn’t a thing I’d drop everything and fly to her country just to tell her how I feel and shoot my shot. But I also know that she’s happy now and who am I to ruin that for her. 

She was my soulmate, my best friend. She was everything. 

I just wish I could hear her voice one more time. To hear her sing to me one last time. To hear her tell me she loves me one last time. We never met but she was my whole life. Just to speak to her with our time difference, I used to sit in my car when it was -40C outside for hours, until my fingers were numb. I’d do it over again just to hear her voice one last time.

173,"Help, I am in a bottomless pit of self-loathing and I can't stop beating myself up","I've had two roommates so far this year I've had fallings out with. It was mostly my fault and I was a really shitty person to them, but tbf I'm really hard on myself and they also were awful themselves a few times. I don't want to explain what I did, but I was a bad roommate and friend.

The most recent one has kicked me out and I'm moving in two days. She created a crazy situation where we suddenly moved in her friend who has really scary, alarming disabilities (almost fell into a diabetic coma several times in front of us) and has a kid, and she's treating me like I'm the crazy one for not liking it. But I yelled at her for waking me up in the middle of the night for rummaging through the fridge and apparently it triggered her PTSD. Thus, I am being kicked out - this isn't the only issue, just one of many and this is the last straw for my roommate. I shouldn't have yelled at her but I don't think that made me the worst person ever. However, it was one thing in a series of shitty things I've done, not that my roommate hasn't also done a few awful things. It's complicated.

I can't get what these two roommates said to me out of my head. My roommate last year told me I was fucked up, and the recent one called me a piece of shit. I just keep replaying both those fights in my head day in and day out, beating myself up and torturing myself. The first roommate also told me that in lazing about and being sad during our conflicts, I was replacing trying to change with feeling sorry for myself and trying to make her feel sorry for me, which wasn't true; I was actually paralyzed, stuck in a spiral of worrying if I was a horrible monster, which has to do with my OCD and is really hard for me to control. But now I worry that what she said is what I'm doing even though I sort of know objectively I'm not.

They were friends with someone I knew who 'bullied them' even though they were so nice.

178,How to deal with my feelings after helping someone through a mental breakdown,"Someone very close to me had a mental breakdown yesterday and these breakdowns are getting frequent. They don't want to get professional help and since they are very close to me I can't cut them out. I'm younger than them and the ""traditional"" dynamic of our relationship would dictate that they should look after me. I don't need that kind of help from them but they are clearly trying to stick to this traditional dynamic so they don't want to accept my help either. But they are sometimes, during these breakdowns dangerous to themselves in terms of self-harming or suicidal intentions. I can't leave them alone when they are upset like that and after they calmed down enough that I know they won't do anything regrettable I give them the space they need.

It made me sad and I talked to our mutual friends about it because I just wanted to get stuff of my chest. When I talked to my best friend, he said there was no problem and I shouldnt trashtalk this mutual female friend. He said I’m being manipulative and the way I went about it is abhorrent since he wanted to stay neutral. Even though he asked me to talk about my problems. Afterwards he blocked me on everything. He literally broke my heart. I’ve known him for 2,5 years and he was like family to me. On the other hand this female friends knew him for 10 years.

180,Mom died unexpectedly. The panic attacks and existential thoughts have been crippling. I wake up every morning thinking of my best friend who isn't here anymore. It's killing me. Please help.,"My Mom died very unexpectedly on December 3rd of 2019. I'm doing my best to deal with not having her in my life because she was such a cornerstone in my life growing up. I was raised by a very loving, somewhat difficult, single mother, as a middle-class family in a upper class town. She slept on the living room couch, as she gave me the bedroom growing up, in our one bedroom condo. She literally did everything for me. Sacrificed everything. Didn't date any men, because I was her primary concern... Wow I'm really putting it out on the line right now.... Forget about a throwaway account.

My Mom was like a superhero to me. When I was younger the first comic book I got was a Wonder Woman comic. I saw my Mom like that. She took extra freelance jobs working late in the city (NYC), which is where my grandparents (in the same town outside the city) would take care of me. Grandma singing me to sleep with lullabies, being my 2nd mother.

When I got the call from my uncle, Mom's brother, ""Hey, Rancor\_Keeper, I'm sorry, but she's gone."" This changed my life. The one person in my life that was a shining beacon of hope. The true hero that I could run to in the middle of the night (when I was a kid) when I had nightmares.... was gone. The gal who got me to love movies, especially Star Wars movies. The last Star Wars movie, The Rise of Skywalker, when I went to the theater I bought an extra seat for her right next to me.  I'm so lost now. However, recently the panic attacks are more frequent and so so crippling. I try to distract myself with work or whatever, but sometimes the panic attacks hit me, or even smash into me like a big wave on the beach.

I know I should probably talk to a professional, but these attacks are occurring more frequent now. My OCD, I've noticed has been significantly been amping up and becoming more prevalent. My dreams..... my dreams I still see her, my Mom, still young and loving life, a social butterfly, like she was at her 50th high school reunion. Yet, when I wake up every single day, I realize 'she's gone'.

I don't know why I started typing this other than I need to stop the fear and panic attacks.",1583100674.0
181,"Trying to cope with depression, add, intermittent unemployment, feeling overwhelmed, and social anxiety, without close Friends in a small town while not dumping it all on my wife and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and near poverty line budget. I am tredding water but I keep going under emotionally.","I know what I need is a support network, or a councilor. But I dont trust my social group, they never check in on me no matter how long it has been since I last came to an event.

 My wife has her own problems and I can only impose so much before I overwhelm her too. 

My dad is an oppressive fundamentalist Christian with a hard-on for ""saving"" me through being possessed by the holy spirt (that's a whole can of worms in my baaement).

I am slowly pulling myself back into my career (which is changing as I realized I dont have the portfolio or drive to succee), but have been barely able to keep employed at any job due to depression and anxiety related performance issues. I finally got the nerve to get help with career by going on unemployment and doing a set of classes (small town has meant one on one time! Which is amazing! Highlight of my week to go and explore and learn and solve social/professional/design problems again) sorry ranting...

I just want to make some friends that I can trust and rely on to be there when I need to talk, or cry, or just scream and wail like the scared child I am on the inside.

I want to get a councilor but I dont qualify for aid nor have it in my budget without making my wife get a second job to pay for it. If I am lucky the new insurance she got will approve a mental health counselor/coach.

I feel like a useless pile of crap as a man (I dont even know what that word means to me anymore or if it applies to me anymore). In the end I am afraid to get close to people as I know most of them have issues as large or as deep as my own to deal with. They dont need mine too. Currently I dont have any friends that call and ask to hang out or come over to play games, etc. Most the people I know already have a close friend.

When I am upset and someone does ask, it feels like I am making them uncomfortable. They try to ""fix it"" or give me resources but can only do so much with their own limited time budget and emotional capacity. I dont want that. I want to talk to people, I want to not feel so alone, so isolated but surrounded by people.

Honestly, typing this here makes me feel more alone, not less, but I am hoping someone has a mechanism or somthing that I can try just to keep trying to crawling forward. As above I found a few that work to help course correct but they dont really fix the underlying issue. What that issue really is I dont know, purpose?, friends?, a role within the social/professional hierarchy? (Job?) Maybe you see something I dont. I am an open book at this point what else do I have to lose? It took nearly everything I had to not drive my car into a cliff face today, so I am near bottom again. I can still see the light from the last week though, I can crawl back out on my own, for now.

What is working so far:
I am doing journaling (free thought to aid with ADD related memory issues). I try to condense the useful stuff into OneNote when I can find the drive and get past the wall of overwhelming sense of dread of 'some unknown catastrophe' that will happen if I get organized. (I think i get overwhelmed by how much I have to get done. And it just gets deeper by ignoring it). When I get overwhelmed I end up anxious then angry then deep depression and resorting to distractions to make it through until I can get back up and try again. By then I am motivated but overwhelmed, and the cycle starts over. Sorry ranting... I have been tracking my time spent with an app and it has helped me to crawl out twice now by letting me see progress daily. Productive to depressed to distractions then crawling back out with excercise between loading screens of Fallout4 and walks and meetings with friends (who dont seem to realise I am struggling, but get uncomfortable if I open up like this about my struggles, not friends, network?, associates?. How do I let them know without breaking down and crying and making them uncomfortable like I have the others.

Background: 
Two years ago I was in a job I hated that was slowly killing me physically and mentally and was just enough to pay the bills. Everyone thought I was fine. I put on a good face. They encouraged me to look for work. I did. I got a counter offer and stupidly took it. I got more work and a little more pay. I had tried to make friends, I thought I had, but they didnt even bother to reach out when I was spiralling down. Is that me or them, I dont know? Maybe I should have asked for help. I should have networked, but I didnt have those social skills at that time. (I had self isolated of and on through MS and HS). I am now building back up but I am now even more afraid of getting close to people, of troubling them, driving away what little connection I have to the world left.

This is the closest thing to a full account I have of all this so I feel it is some how a good thing to put it all down as messy as it is, it is me. Who I am right now. Welcome to my head space. Help?",1577084054.0
182,"Unable to find peace from bullies, how to cope with community harassment and discrimination","I am nearly 30 and experience daily harassment and maltreatment from people long after high school, including from a teen boy and girl, and a muscly psychotic twenty-something male on my parents street whenever I go to visit them, as well as a young woman my age next door at my condo, and high schoolers passing by where I live when I leave the house. They mainly call me homophobic slurs but also bang on the walls and scream at me at any little sound I make like when I'm just talking to my family or friends or watching a show. I am quiet and non-confrontational. **Life is pure hell and I struggle with suicidality, nightmares and flashbacks**. I used to feel comfortable at my parents house but moved when my neighbours started bullying me, taking pictures of me and laughing on their phone when I made an appearance. The psychotic muscly guy had his friends over, and they took an unsolicited pic of me on his selfie stick, screaming I was ugly when I was outside once. The teen girl comes out with her friends and yells things at me as they walk by my parents house, or they loiter in her car on the street yelling insults at me. The boy does similar stuff, hanging out outside screaming insults at me, or honking the horn of his family's dumpy little trailer. My parent's street is a regular suburb, but these people's kids are really hostile and always calling me homophobic slurs.

High school was really bad but I got through it even when they made a fake profile of me filled with disturbing, sexually explicit homophobic, transphobic fucked up shit on twitter in grade 12. I thought it would be over after and I actually DID have about three or four years of peace from any bullying after high school. I had an amazing few years in college, not perfect but I felt accepted there and actually felt a sense of being my own person with an identity and worthy of existing. This all deteriorated when I came back to my hometown.

I have serious mental illness now and can't work in a standard work environment now because of agoraphobia, social anxiety, trauma. I am barely living. My family knows all this stuff is happening because they have been in earshot when these people insult me, but they turn a blind eye and I guess it's too awful for them to contemplate. The other thing is that the teenage boy is really charming and manipulative, so my parents think he's great even when right in front of them he shouts slurs at me. It's fucked up. 

I don't know what to do about all this. I definitely have Complex PTSD, but am still also experiencing ongoing trauma every time I go to visit my parents or just step outside the house because teenage boys or men shout insults at me as well. I can't go to the mental health clinic for therapy because young guys there in the waiting room also insult me. **My town basically treats me like a pariah and want me dead.

I’m an indoor lifeguard, yesterday I worked an 8 hr shift and I didn’t see a little girl drowning. For some info, the little girl didn’t have a life jacket on, her family was nearby, and I wasn’t looking. Why? I was busy scolding a little boy that was on the OTHER end of the pool, my back was facing the little girl who had fell into the pool and I didn’t even hear any flailing or even a splash, it was so quiet. I was scolding the little boy because he was in a location meant for lifeguards only and I was telling him to get out, and by the time I had turned around I saw the little girl just silently (?) drowning and I was going to jump in but her mom did and saved her. I feel awful, I feel lost in a way? I don’t know, it hasn’t hit me now that if I wasn’t scolding that little boy and instead was looking I could’ve saved her sooner because she had a swallowed a good amount of water and was shaken up badly. I feel awful because I’m a lifeguard and I’m meant to save lives and yet I failed to see her drowning, I’m glad she’s still alive but I feel terrible about it because if I was looking maybe it wouldn’t have happened and she wouldn’t have swallowed as much water as she did.

My Dad doesn’t really deny my eldest sibling being his favorite anymore, but when we mentioned how my Moms favorite was my other sibling, my Dad quickly agreed. My Mom didn’t really even deny it but instead just moved the conversation to another topic. I didn’t really know what to do so I just kinda stayed quiet, the fact that they didn’t deny it really hit me. I guess them not denying it made it real and it hurt, a lot. I knew I wasn’t my Dads favorite but now knowing I’m not my Moms favorite either really hurts. I’m not trying to say that I want my sibling to be the least favorite child, I truly don’t because I love them so much. I’m so proud of them but I guess I just wish we were all loved equally. It really hurts me because my whole life I’ve been trying to get out of my siblings shadow and prove myself to my parents and now it seems all for naught. I’m not sure what to do…I’m not even angry, I’m just upset. I don’t even know what to do, do I confront them or just go about my life now knowing this? I just would like some feed back cause I feel extremely alone and I don’t really have anyone to turn to.

Re:
I’ve discussed it with my Mom and I think I’ve realized that I’m not truly over the fact that my Dad doesn’t really notice or recognize me. When my Dad said my Moms favorite was my other sibling, I immediately assumed my Mom would start ignoring me too. I’ve talked things over with my Mom and she told me that I shouldn’t spend my time trying to get my Dads attention but instead do things for myself. After getting out of my head I realize that my Mom doesn’t really favor any of us. She tries to interact and find things we are interested in and do them with us, but to me, it may sometimes seem like she favors one of us. I’m honestly going to focus on doing things for me instead of trying to get recognition from my Dad. I want to say thank you to everyone who answered my post, the comments helped me a lot, they allowed me to take a step back and truly address my emotions. So thank you.",1632280945.0
195,Depressed over upcoming move,"I’ve been living in Hawaii for 9 months. We moved here for my partners job with 4 days notice (he is a traveling healthcare professional). After his assignment ended, we decided to stay. In our time here, I have completely changed as a person. My online business grew enormously. I’ve never been happier or healthier. With the great time difference (I’m from the east coast) comes a level of peace and solitude that I’m so grateful for. The sunshine and endless adventure has turned me into a more active person who now pushes myself to do scary things. I am completely happy and settled here. And now, we have to move....

Our landlord, who we have had a great relationship with, essentially decided that he wanted to charge more rent, and rather than ask us if we would pay more (which we would have!) he is now using the property for vacation rentals only. That, plus my accountant telling us that we are going to get slapped with a large tax bill if we stay much longer, has led us to the decision to move. And I have not felt this depressed in a long time.

There are parts of me that are excited for the next chapter - seeing friends again, being closer to family, not being SO far from everything. But I can’t help but feel a deep sorrow for the life I’m leaving behind. On top of that, there is a semi-feral cat who has become very close to us, and we are torn over whether we should leave the cat here where she can be free and roam, or take her with us where she’ll pretty much be in an apartment all the time. We travel a lot, so adopting a pet isn’t something we thought we’d do. But I cannot imagine just leaving her behind...

I don’t know how to cope with all the changes and decisions. I’m so tired from crying, trying to figure out what to do with the cat, trying to figure out where to move, the logistics of it all, etc. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you 🥺❤️.

201,I have to look at naked dudes way too much.,"To clarify, I’m an art student. I’ve drawn figure models for years, always nude, but most of them have been women. Now that I’m in college, there’s a lot more male models.
I’ve got some sexual trauma I’m healing from, and yes, I am seeing a therapist. But EVERY TIME a male figure model comes in, I completely check out mentally just so I can survive the class, and it’s as if I didn’t even go to class. I learn nothing that day and I’m usually unnerved and upset when I get home. None of the coping mechanisms I know have helped me aside from leaving the room, which isn’t ideal because it’s bad as soon as I return.
You have to pay a LOT of attention in figure class, literally “draw every line on this dudes asscrack” level of detail. This school is not Cheap. I’m only able to make it because of my scholarships, but seriously I’m trying so hard to get something out of these figure classes. 

The figure models are nice people, really, and I’d never tell them about the issues I have. But I do know I have once slipped up while having a panic attack and made direct eye contact with a model with such pain, sorrow, and disgust on my face and in my whole Being. I have to focus so hard on freezing my face so I don’t grimace at these people just trying to make a living.

209,"(TLDR) Husband gets incredibly angry when we play games together, and it makes me want to stop playing games altogether.","I have a rather unique situation.  I considered posting this to an advice or gaming sub, but this seems more appropriate?  I'm just not sure...Please let me know if it should be moved.  

Obligatory, writing this on mobile, so sorry about formatting issues.  I'll try to keep this brief, but there's some pertinent information that should be included. to provide insight to the situation. Please be kind, I'm human after all... And if this gets too long, I'm sorry.
TLDR at the bottom.

History: I've had a pretty rough past that's taken a mental and physical toll on me.  I have PTSD due to multiple relationship related traumas and abuse.  I've also got issues with memory, psychomotor retardation, which is basically a slowed mental and physical response to just about everything especially in difficult situations, I'm incredibly clumsy, and have very delayed spacial awareness.  I've been verbally abused in the past, called names, insulted, and treated like I'm stupid, when I actually have a decent intellect, my responses are just delayed.  I've basically been made to feel small my entire life, therefore I take things to heart, a lot, which contributes to my many mental health issues.  

I'm in therapy to learn to cope with my issues, and one of the things that helps me is my love of video games.  If I'm having a bad day, I throw myself into video games to distract my mind. I wouldn't say that I'm bad at video games, I think I'm decent at best, because of my exaggerated responses.

Problem: I've (35f) been with my husband (38m)for 5 years.  Our marriage is pretty great, he's my best friend, he understands me, this is quite literally the best relationship I've ever had...I finally found my happy place.  We enjoy playing video games together, whether we play the same game together, or different games at the same time, we bond over gaming, among other things.  

BUT where I play for fun, (get a little bummed if I mess up, but try again) Hubs can get absolutely irate over them. Last night for (just one) example, we were playing Overwatch, Capture The Flag. 

The opposing team took our flag and made it halfway across the map before the flag carrier died.  He tells me, ""go touch the flag so they can't get it!"" 

OKAY!  

I jump to a lower level, down to where the flag dropped, there's a three opponents trying to pick up the flag, I pop my Ultimate and proceed to try to touch the flag, while defending myself.  I died, but not without taking two of them with me.  Ultimately the flag was capped by the opposing team.

My husband starts yelling at me...  

""What were you doing?! Why didn't you touch the flag?!""

""I was trying."" 

""You weren't trying! You weren't even touching the flag! Don't worry about fighting, just touch it!""

""I was trying..."" 

""It didn't look like it!""

I left the game. Turned off the PS4, and wanted to crawl into a hole...

""Oh so fuck me I guess?! I guess I don't matter!"" He says and grumpily turns the game off as well.  (I never said he had to stop.)

This isn't a solitary incident of him getting mad about something I didn't do correctly in a game.  I mess up sometimes, (okay, a lot) I've learned to accept that it happens, but it's like in those moments, he thinks I do it intentionally. Every. Single. Time. 

""I'm trying to make you a better player!"" 
By treating me like crap? That's super effective... 

I flash back to old relationships, feeling small and stupid, and it's like it's happening all over again, the name-calling, insults and feeling of worthlessness, come back like a tidal wave without him actually saying those things.  

He eventually apologizes, but it doesn't help how I'm feeling by that point.  This feeling of inadequacy...I've been working in therapy, ways to cope with those moments, but it's an incredibly slow process. 

I don't really know what I want out of posting this, I just feel so defeated.  It hurts to be reminded of how much of a failure I am.   It's been happening more frequently recently, and I'm to the point where I don't even want to play video games with him anymore, much less at all.... Not even for myself.

210,I feel like I'm losing my best friend at the worst time.,"I just don't know what to do anymore. 

Where do I start? I feel as if I am straight up one of the unluckiest people to ever touch this earth. I guess Ill start with what prompted me to write this to begin with. 

I don't feel as if I can talk to my best friend anymore and its ruining me. Growing up I have a history with social anxiety and it has been a persistent problem throughout my life, its nothing minor either, It hurts my day to day life quite a lot. Anyway a couple of years ago my best friend of around 7-8 years at the time came out to me as transgender, this hit me quite hard mostly due to the anxiety but eventually I managed to work my way through it... Mostly. I have no issues with who they are but the whole experience of adjusting my perspective on who I thought they were was rather jarring and I'm still not completely used to it today.

Fast Forward to a couple of months ago and they let me know they have a condition called Dissociative Identity Disorder, A condition that basically causes someones personality to split resulting in multiple people living in their head. That's the best way I can describe it as I understand it. The problem is I'm just too damn scared to deal with these new identities they have developed and as a result its causing me to slowly distance from and lose my best friend... my only friend really which is killing me. Especially with everything going on at the moment both in my life and the rest of the world, I need them there for me just as they need me there for them. I'm too scared to talk to them now because I don't know if I'm talking to them or one of the people she shares a brain with.

To give a bit more perspective as to everything going on with me at the moment... back in February I got diagnosed with bone cancer in my right leg, I'm only 21 years old. This completely destroyed me at the time but Ive managed to cope with the help of both my family and my friend and I'm most of the way through my treatment now and I'm looking to recover for around Christmas. Thing is Ive ONLY had my immediate family (Parents and younger sister) as well as my best friend to help me cope with this, but now I feel as though Ive lost my friend who was also the only person who seemed to understand me. Whilst my family are caring and supportive they aren't really understanding of what actually goes on in my head or the situation I'm in so I feel somewhat disconnected from them. This was different with my friend but now I'm losing them too I feel like I have nowhere left to go.

Ideally I would go to a therapist but as you can imagine that's impossible for me right now. I feel so alone and just don't know what to do. If anyone can give me advice on what I can do or point me in the right direction to other places I can get it I would feel a lot better",1599003617.0

216,Adjustment Disorder (aka a 21st century broken heart),"Hi Reddit. First time poster, so apologies in advance for any breaches of etiquette etc.

About a year ago, I had a significant hand in ending a near 8-year relationship. A relationship that bore 2 fur-babies, 1 human baby and the usual ups and downs a long term commitment usually entails.

Reasons for the split included (but weren't limited to):
- I was lazy and took my partner for granted
- I didn't communicate well and assumed she knew what I was getting at.
- I didn't help around the house.
- My job which was a contributing factor to reasons 1 and 3. I work shift work so I was often sleeping, didn't help much when I was awake and would often work extended hours.

At the time of our split, I was so frustrated that I declined the topic of couples counselling. We couldn't resolve anything and for my part, I did little to meet my ex-partner even close to halfway.

Biggest. Mistake. Of. My. Life. 

We agreed to end it there and then. I moved out some months later. To this day we are amicable with each other. There are no problems with my visiting our daughter (my job means it's better our daughter live full time with her mother) and I have no issues with whatever financial support I can assist with.

But I haven't moved on. I've tried. But I just can't. I blew it with my soul mate and I can't get her back. I simply can't get past how badly I've messed this up and will never get a second chance.

I've begged for her to take me back (picture a 6 foot 4 man bawling his eyes out pleading and it's close to the mark), but as she reasonably pointed out; the resentment (from her end) was too much.

My inability to move on has gradually become worse over the recent months. I've tried to date. Overall it hasn't been successful because deep down: I still love this woman. I self-sabotage any new relationship because I'm still in denial (insert better term if applicable) because I want my soul mate back.

My doctor has said I have an adjustment disorder and I've started seeing a psychologist who says I have depressive rumination. He's not bad, but he wants me to commit what I'm feeling to paper. I just can't do it. Because then every fear I have about losing my ex forever is on paper. It's tangible. I don't want that.

The final gut punch came yesterday evening when I saw my ex on a dating app. Let's address the hypocrisy first: if I'm on an app as well, why on earth am I upset? Great question. Because while she 100% deserves to be happy, I just wish it was with me. She has every right to live her life how she wants. I get that. But I'm still absolutely devastated.

Long story short....I feel like I'm starting to lose control of my emotions. I'm so far beyond my mental safety nets that I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Thoughts appreciated.",1586975988.0

I know I'm spiraling, but what am I going to do when my child loses half of their friends?! Why am I a villain in my child's eyes because other parents WON'T keep their kids safe?! For a handful of chocolate?!

I already had fucking anxiety way before this all  started. I've begun unconsciously clenching my teeth and hurting my jaw. I'm too poor to even do good deeds, helpless to change anything, and now I'm the bad guy even in my own home because my child is too young to understand I'm not just being mean.

I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right place to put this. All I know is I'm overwhelmed and terrified and apparently nearly alone in my worry in my community!",1586485032.0
218,My mom's creepy weird boyfriend,"Look I dont want to go back to therapy, and I have no way out of here unless I dont want to be able to afford college. My mom's boyfriend decided to stare at my boobs and ask, ""what's there?"" And there wasnt anything on my shirt so I felt very uncomfortable and my mom was in the other room. I told everyone I could and my mom refuses to believe me and my sister told me to give this creepy ass man another chance. Not only that but he previously dissed my  deceased father. I'm hungover because it's not the first time I've been in a situation where a sexual harasser was in my life. It's the third. I cant keep running from this shit and destroying my liver. I've been forced to be around him for a while. My mom is telling me to be nice yesterday when I put my foot down but I dont think he deserves the respect so I stopped trying. I should've seen the signs considering he bought me tea and stuff and he didn't buy my sister any. I try to lock myself in my room when he's here because my mom tells me 10 minutes before he comes so I keep having to figure out what to do. I literally stole the debit card information so I could eat food away from him. It makes me physically sick to be around him. I got like no sleep. It actually drives me further from my mom, which she's aware of. She's just desperate for someone to love her. I've been trying to make him feel as unwelcome as possible since I'm forced to interact but I dont think it's working. I grabbed the salad with my bare hands and said I didnt wash them, didnt give him a fork, purposely interrupted him, didnt even look him in the eye, played loud trap music. My mom even said, ""we should've gone out"" to him. I was like, ""yeah you really should've"" I also said ""bye"" but never ""hi"". Obviously it didnt work. He's still going to come around and I dont know when. I'm just sad because I cant feel comfortable in the place I'm supposed to feel safe.

My sister assisted her poor financial decision too. Oh and what makes it worse is the day before she said she couldnt afford the better deal. It wouldnt be an issue if she didnt lie about it. She ended up paying the same price in the end and I got the short end of the stick.

221,A friend might take her life before disease takes her.," Hello everyone, maybe my message will disappear but I felt the need to put it out there anonymously, and if you have advice, that would be so lovely... 

Years ago, I did an internship is a secluded part of England to work in a lovely inn. Friends of my mother kindly found me this opportunity and offered to host me. I lived on their farm for a few months and completely fell in love with the countryside and the mentality of the people there, especially these Friends (Jane and Henry – not real names) that I consider as English relatives. Both of them are a little old, but barely and are still so very much active: riding horses, building a barn, walking across the countryside, traveling everywhere, riding bicycles, kidding around with a zip-line... they like to live and laugh. 

  
  (Quick clarification: I live in France and we met them when they hired my mother to tend to some apartments they own in France. They would sometimes come down themselves and meet us to hang out. Sometimes Jane couldn't come so Henry would come by himself.) 

  
  Before I got there, though, Jane suffered from colon cancer but beat it successfully. It never came back, however, she suffered from abdominal pain and was told by the clinic that some type of food would get stuck into leftover scars in her inners (they had removed the sick parts, and the scars would sometimes get inflamed). For two years she went back and forth to the clinic, seeing specialists, losing weight as she controlled everything she ate, and they eventually organized heavy surgery for her: first to remove other parts of her inners, second to actually place a colostomy bag which allowed her to finally eat what she liked and put on some weight again. 

  
  We visited them as much as we could. When I lived with them I tried to bake her gourmet things she could eat. One day at the restaurant, the bag filled under her lovely dress, it showed, and she went in the bathroom to change it looking embarrassed, so we bought her a beautiful 100% cashemire cape for her to enjoy her nights out without worrying about the bag showing... 

  
  I really love them dearly and was recently told by Henry that they believed she started to “not be really there, in her head” which was confirmed last Friday by their doctor: After undergoing so much trauma and surgery, Jane started suffering from dementia. Henry said that it will not get better, that it isn't curable, and that she had approximately two years before potentially not remembering him nor their family. 

  
  I just saw Henry who was rushing back home earlier to be with her, and he told me : “We made plans to live our lives more peacefully, now we have to make other plans...” 

  
  Here is the thing, Jane told me once that she had been in so much pain one day, that when they gave her morphine and felt the pain going away, she thought that she was dying and felt relieved. When she woke up again she remembered thinking: “Oh no...” 

  
  Both my mother and I are afraid that what Henry meant was that Jane might not want to let herself waste away and be a burden to her family, which might mean assisted or planned suicide...? She doesn't have the personality of a sick, weak person on the very contrary, I can absolutely see her make up her mind... 

  
  This sadden me so much, and I know that I have no say in this. I guess I just wondered if there is something that I could do to make her happy. Do I bring it up in case she wants to talk about it next time? Do I remain my happy self and make the most out of the time we have got? What can I say to support her and make her feel empowered? 

  
  Thank you for any advice you may have..",1579435783.0
222,A world of shit is choking the life out of me.,"Long term child abuse (into adulthood), tried to build a new life (I did), established new family, therapy, 2 of my new family got murdered in ways that would belong in subs about how nothing matters but the pockets of a few, 2 of them killed themselves after lifelong struggle with mental illness.

I live in a 'world-class' city, often voted most desirable in the world. However, the level of beauracratic incompetence and malfunction is pathological. We have the richest people here, as well as the most famous neighbourhood for addicts and poverty in the world. 

I see both sides. I see why my friends decided to keep their last shred of dignity and make their own decisions. 

Our health system was decimated by a couple of decades of selfish, money-hungry politicians and the slime that vote for them.

My city keeps boasting about jobs and economic growth, but that's a fucking joke. 

Jobs don't mean shit when they keep you in minimum wage limbo - forever someone's wage slave. Often the people on top calling the shots are disgustingly underqualified - but this is also a hypocrisy where money always trumps valuing life.

I got a degree. In fact, I have 2, plus a whole slew of well-rounded qualifications. I volunteer. I put life above profit.

I live in a world, in a cuntry where two-faced liars who only know how to count pennies keep making inhumane cuts to the public health system, heavily targetting mental health.

My city is famous for setting records for the opioid crisis. My city is famous for spreading its legs and welcoming money-laundering and corruption in exchange for kickbacks and personal perks. The whole country is pretty much blind to anything but profit.

It's amazing - 1st world facade, shithole beneath. Shithole people with shithole values valuing pennies over lives. Valuing crom-knows-what over the lives of their brothers and sisters.

My country is famous for murdering its indigenous people - back in the day, and today. They will call 911 if they on an elderly indigenous person and his 12 yr old grandchild because some racist prick thought they had too much money in their bankaccount. (Narrator: Everything was perfectly legit).

The police put the little girl and her grandpa in cuffs. 

Meanwhile, my friend who was murdered (along with a 2nd victim) - never got a fighting chance. His employers subject him to unsafe working conditions, and the murderer was his superior.

Also, his employers are extremely wealthy private citizens who can somehow skirt employment standard law with 0 consequences.

Also, that 2nd victim had reported death threats and harrassment by the murderer weeks before and the lovely illustrious law enforcement here did jack shit.

Because of they were rich? My friend was white, so we all know that the only colour that matters is green.

What do I get? 
CPSTD
Insane amounts of added expense just trying to rescue my murdered and suicided friends property/intellectual work/pet.
Still have to pay for any therapy I need but I don't have $100/hr.

Meanwhile, the brilliant ministers and their henchmen get raises and benefits.

I did everything I was supposed to do.

the world is full of shit.

why even bother?

Edit: Oh and all the websites for all the fragments of what is supposed to be socialized healthcare function like they were designed by donald trump. all show no substance.
It is fucking rich that a country that boasts about their healthcare drops the biggest ball on the most important part of the human body. Mental health is considered separate from ""health"". If I was a shithead and ate too much candy, I can get a free ride when I succumb to diabetes. But my mental health problems that were caused by the absurd level of wilful ignorance and incompetence by the government itself isn't covered.

The mental health resources in my city (and country) are fragmented worse than the Ice Queen's mirror. It's fucking ridiculous when the head doesn't know where its arse is.  Phone number after phone number. Websites that are similar in integrity to melamine-fortified baby formula.

I called the crisis line. They were nice. They agreed that the system is designed to frustrate. 

We have 1000s of scientists. Tonnes of mental health experts. But the people making policy are going directly against everything that science tells us on  how the human brain works.

I have a background in neuro. I know exactly how much my brain is being damaged at every turn. 
I'm not Rocky.

Australia is burning to shit because of ignorant cumstains. My country is going down the same path. It already is too late.

Human lives matter.

Otherwise what's the point of living?",1579305413.0
223,How do deal with haters in friendship groups?,"I have been able to keep my circle of friends fairly small over the years. I have built good relationships with these people that I’ve known ranging between 5-11 years. One of my friends in the friendship group whom I felt I built the closest relationship to over the past 2 years, has recently been making new close friends whom I’m not particularly close with although aware of them. I am completely fine with my close friends hanging with whoever they choose to hang with and 100% support it. But this close friend has built a sense of stubbornness maybe with his new friends, by himself or at home, I don’t know. But this stubbornness has caused every interaction I have with this particular person to be meaningless. 

This was also happening 6-8 months prior to this current situation. In that particular situation a few months back was the first time I’ve seen this friend act in such a disrespectful way towards me as he is the nicest out of the bunch it was quiet shocking to me. Rewinding back to that particular time my reaction to his disrespect was addressing the situation to him and how it made me feel. He agreed and apologised if he “hurt my feelings”. I forgave him for apologising and our friendship became stronger for the next 2-3 months.

After those 2-3 months had ended he quickly became himself again, and back into his disrespectful ways. Fast forward to now and he is still this same person. I asked for some advice from another friend in my circle, he listened but did not give any advice on how should I attack this issue, as the first disrespectful experience this friend advised I go talk to him and tell him how I feel, but since it happened again this friend was left speechless.

And so now currently I avoid every interaction with this person, whatsoever, but for some reason he treats me like a friend and occasionally says “hi”, “bye”, and asks me occasional questions when he needs help from me or wants to see how I’m doing. If you flip the script which I’ve tried and I be that person asking him questions, he tries to avoid it eg. If we’re in group activity with my whole friend group everything is fine or is one member from my friend group is there with me and this friend playing sport it’s fine. But as soon as I ask if that dodgy friend when other friends aren’t at school and I ask him “do you want to play basketball”, “go to the canteen”,”go gym”,he always replies and I mean always replies “maybe if others are going” in an attempt to try to shut me down and avoid me.

So as this “friend” which I barely consider a friend is in my friendship group with other friends and is constantly disrespectful towards me, how do I attack this situation as I cannot really get rid of him as he’s friends with others in the group. This is affecting my decisions to make plans with my other friends, because if I exclude this toxic friend I will end up isolating myself., from my friendship group.

224,"Best friend killed, court sucks, justice is weak","Hi. I just gotta vent.

I've lost so many people in such a short time. It's ridiculous. Unrelated deaths but in the past 2 years it's been murder, murder, 'accidental', suicide.

and that's just the people closest to me.

3 people who graduated with me are dead. murder, suicide, 'accidental'.

1 person whom i looked up to, who supported me so much, who had been through the kind of hell i have, who saw the pain i went through decided to euthanize themselves. I respect their decision in every way - i know what they went through.
 I just don't know how to deal with it myself.  I don't know that I wouldn't have to make that decision myself in 10 years when everything comes crashing down.

(child abuse is a bitch. You get over it. You grow up. Then you realize it's been lying in wait to get you. Physical, mental health gets chipped away. New studies are still coming out on how deleterious the effects of childhood abuse are. You are more at risk for all kinds of mental illness (depression, anxiety, (c)ptsd, personality disorders), and your physical takes such big blows.

Another one killed by a piece of shit. 
My shining beacon of light, my best friend and my creative partner, the better half of my band was killed. for no reason other than being where he was - AT WORK. killed by someone who could have been put away before the deed had the justice system been more diligent and less inept. 

Does not help that being poor/working class is certainly not a leg up in a society that sucks the dick of the wealthy.

I don't know. I'm medicated, drunk and high right now, so I'm rambly, confident and opinonated. But I'm really just a broken human being.

I tried. I still try. I try every day.

Do or do not. There is no try. that little green dude better be right.

Some days I want to die. I have no desire to live. I wake up and it's like ""Oh...I'm awake. Guess I'll have to do stuff.""

Court was shit. They said 1 question (I'm not implicated or a suspect), in and out 5 minutes. I was cross-examined for 30 minutes.

I spent every last bit of my energy trying to focus on not having a full-blown panic attack in front of a room of ~100 people, jury, audience, press.  They made me dig up painful moments that I have spent the past 2 years trying hard to forget in therapy and through my own effort.

Fuck that crown prosecuter. He didn't have to lie to me. ""In and out in 5 minutes. No more. You don't have to say anymore. You won't have to say anymore."" You fucking liar.

I could have braced and prepared myself. I could have sought help from a counselor to prepare myself.

Fuck you.

One piece of shit decides to stab 2 people to death on account of him being a piece of shit, and the living have to suffer, years later.

Justice is weak. The wheels of justice are rusted and square. Unlike the wheels of the corrupt, that are well lubed by a steady flow of cash.

I'm pretty sure there are 2 sets of laws. One set allows you to live a comfortable sheltered life, where all is easily forgiven with a shallow apology. One is where the already marginalized are held at a higher standard than law-makers and the able.

Pretty sure that no country in the world values human life over cold, hard cash. That is the world we live in. 

I wish I could do something. You read shit about how 1 person campaigned to get laws changed... I wish I could do that. My friend was killed at his worksite by a former employer who was allowed access to his living quarters. Somehow that is being majorly overlooked in the case which is still going on, but the case has NOTHING to do with all the other employers who knew the situation. 

Anyone in Canada want to say something? If you get killed at your worksite by your employer, the company still might not be held responsible, because apparently providing safe work environments is not something Canada believes in.

230,"How to handle anger about someone killing another (a child), someone who the court let out early?","My cousin's wee daughter ""C"" was murdered by her daycare provider. 18 months old, beautiful, charming, cute & full of life she was. Both she & her brother were at the daycare's  when this happened. 

The beast (her killer) wanted to go out shopping so she strapped little C into a car seat that was for a baby, (too small for C) and put her inside a dark closet & closed the door. The beast wanted to go to McDonalds' & Walmart and hang out at the mall, (and this woman was middle aged & had a grown son who lived with her).

Before she left wee C in the closet, she didn't let her son know that she was leaving, (or maybe she did & doesn't want her son to go to jail, if he might be involved). C suffocated because of the too small car seat's straps which strangled her as she tried to get out of the seat. When the beast came home she eventually called for an ambulance and lied about how C came to be in distress. She kept saying how she had no idea how this happened as she was always watching C. When my cousin came to get her other child, the little boy just said ""gone, gone, gone"" over & over to his mum.

This beast was sentenced to only 3.5 years for the murder of a toddler and she was just released after only serving 9 months!!! The parole board was supposed to notify my cousin when she was up for parole, instead they just released her.  The parole board stated that they didn't believe that the beast was remorseful, but they released her anyway!!! WTF WTF WTF.

I want to make sure that this person never is in charge of any child ever again, but there isn't an oversight group for home daycare where my cousin lives. Please don't talk about forgiveness because some things are never forgiveable. This woman has forever destroyed the family that my cousin was so happy & proud about. This woman has no remorse & has stated that, ""she isn't the monster everyone thinks I am."" This woman deserves to be in jail for the rest of her life. Her house should be forfeit & given either to my cousin's family (not that they would take it) or to a children's charity.

I am so full of anger, (an anger that in no way compares to how my cousin & his wife are feeling) right now & I am finding ways to deal with it, but there is at the core of this a feeling of helplessness due to the injustice of the sentencing & the beast's early parole, (and how the parole board doesn't think that she has any remorse about killing a child).

I don’t want to be pushy about it because my libido has dropped dramatically since having my first child almost 3 years ago. I tried to talk about it with him tonight because I want us to have a better physical relationship. The conversation ended when he said that most times he’d rather masturbate in the shower than try to get me in the mood without the guarantee of a payoff. He was trying to be diplomatic about it but it hurt. 

I’m not looking for solutions, we’ll work through our issues together. I just needed to say this “out loud” to somebody who doesn’t matter and doesn’t care about this relationship.",1645870518.0

With the gas I have right now, I can probably make it to Orlando but after that I'm stuck. I'm not really sure what to do at this point except maybe go to a gas station and ask people for help. Any ideas would be helpful, thank you.

I called a few churches and no one is answering. I called 211 and they don't offer help with things like that. I called The Domestic Violence Shelter here and they are full and they don't help with things like that unless you're in shelter. I asked my friend for help and she can't help me because she has her own kids to worry about which I understand.

238,the passing of my boyfriend,"i’ve never really posted here and i’m kinda unsure of how it works but, i thought it might be a good idea.
on dec. 6 i was driving my car with my boyfriend, taking him to work. we were going down our favorite route when i wrecked. the roads were wet, the sky was grey, and we were listening to our favorite music artist. i wasn’t speeding and our seatbelts were buckled. i started to swerve passing a certain curve when i fell unconscious. i woke up about 30-45 minutes laters with two ambulances, multiple cop cars, and a woman surrounding my jeep. i realized i was through the windshield and unable to see the passenger side. it was so crushed. i could only see his legs. my head was pounding and my vision was purple and blurry. while the woman was leading me out of the car, she told me she was passing and saw my car in the ditch. after getting the phone number and contacting my dad to the site, i was told my beautiful boy had passed in the crash. my mind has been cluttered ever since. the information spreader so fast. i’ve gotten multiple peoples support, but along with that was multiple death threats. i’ve been excused from my eocs this semester and my job. during this era of free time, i’ve spent it setting up a memorial at the site. i’ve had people burn the things i’ve put down and burn pictures of my face at the site as well. his family isnt happy with me, but who could blame them? they no longer want me near the crash site at all and want me to put nothing there “out of respect for him.” 
him and i spent every waking minute we had together. he used to tell me i was the most important human in his life and no one has ever understood me like he did. i’m just not sure what i’m supposed to do without him and the people telling me it should’ve been me. its hard not to listen to them. it just hurts a lot. i’ve been spending every night sneaking out of my house and walking until i see the sun starting to rise. it’s all my fault. i found someone who finally treated me with so much respect and listened to me when i needed to speak, and i took it all away.

239,I don't know how to put it in words.,"I can't fully explain what happened to me in detail, it's far too graphic. I'm a 19 yo male from NYC and my cousins (both sisters) are natives like me (from NYC). I can out about the abuse and rape I was subjugated to, from the ages of 7 to 16, unbeknownst that my cousins and I shared a similar fate, from the same man. It was horrible for them, and I mean worse than what could've happened to me had it been more brutal. Yesterday I finally told both of my parents everything I remembered after hearing the news about my cousins. Apparently I'm still within the statute of limitations and so are my cousins, but when faced with the idea that I'll be telling the police I got the absolute shit scared out of me, I had been told by a friend who's on the force that they'll ask me questions along the lines of;

 ""why didn't you stop it?""

 ""why didn't you speak up sooner?""

 ""Were you the one to initiate anything that happened?"" 

And I figured I'd be prepared for it, since I've came out about this issue I've had sever anxiety and insomnia, and after having an anxiety attack at 5:45am today I figured I wouldn't be prepared to do anything. 

Is that wrong?

I'm the only one who can do this, my cousins aren't in NYC anymore and I'm pretty sure they could be out of their statute of limitations. I'm being told left right and center I have to be an advocate and seek justice for what happened to me and my cousin's and I hate to even think about it, but the possibility of countless other children he could've done this too. I'm scared, honestly scared, I keep hearing this nonsensical voice in my head saying;

""I'm a man, this shouldn't have happened to me. Men aren't supposed to be put into a position like this, no one is. Then why'd it have to happen to me?"" 

The problem is I know it's just my voice, I'm terrified of telling the police, I'm terrified of being accused that it was my fault, and I'm terrified to see his face again in court.

240,Crippling Social Anxiety and Trust Issues,"As of writing this post its 4AM and ive been up all night thinking about my past. The problem is that I have massive social anxiety and huge trust issues that spiral into episodes of paranoia. My brain would make assumptions about people doing things behind my back because they secretly hate me or that they dont like me and dont wish to confront me.
Ive dealt with really nasty betrayals of my trust in the past and have had an ex who cheated on my with a best friend at the time. These series of events in my life has put me in a hyper mode of constantly analyzing my own actions and words so as not to offend or hurt anyone, and also a hyper mode of suspicion of others. I feel like im stuck in a self fulfilling cycle of paranoia and im at my wits end on how to get out.

My former best friend told me I deserved them have an affair behind my back because my ex lied and told him I would abuse her behind closed doors. She said I would gas light and manipulate her to do sexual favors when it was the other way around and to this day that haunts me. Without any recourse of my own I was already written off as a demonic person. My character completely assassinated and my reputation destroyed. I have had trouble sleeping for 5 years and its extremely exhausting to talk to women with any intention of intimacy or interest.

    My girl and i had our first child 3 months ago. Hes obviously too young but i think thats fucked up that she doesnt want me to introduce my son to those thing, which i would like to. Whether hes into it or not, i would show him one day. But shes crazy against it and is afraid he will be mad fun of for taking on either. Thats her reasoning, that and she just doesnt like either.
    We argue time and time again. I explain that shes being insanely unrealistic and selfish. People are going to come into his life and introduce him to things whether you like it or not. She wont budge though. I personally could care less if he doesnt like the stuff i show him but its something id like to show him one day. Theres no ill intent here. Hes my son too, like wtf.

245,My drug addict family sucks,"
I'm writing this to gets stuff off my chest.
(btw I'm a 17yo female) 
So my parents divorced when I was 6.
I didn't really know what Was going on.
AT the time... I thought my mother Was a Psychopath.
Now I know my dad told me ließ but I'll get to that in a Minute.
Anyway He met a woman. Let's call her Elle. To protect her (eventhough I hate her to death).
She Was always weird and would scream a lot.
Sometimes she would break plates to try to stab us. 
When I Was 9 my dad explained to me that she was an alcoholic and drug addict. Until I was 9 1/2 I haven't talked to my mom at all. So she finally contacted me. 
In my innocent mindest... I still hated her. Until she visited and sat me down to talk. She explained everything. See, when I was 5 we moved to germany. 
My mother was American so she couldn't stay long. 
Only if my mother and father Could Prove that their marrige is going '' well"". 
One Day He brought Ella home and kicked my mother out. So my dad also promised my mother that they'd move to America. But that never happened. He isn't legal in America. He'd have major issues if he'd go to the USA. (A few months ago I found out he used to be involved with the mob (mafia). I suspect it has to do with that. Idk) anyway. My mother was in therapy the whole time. She had missed me more than anything. 
And my dad forced her to leave and to ""keep his little princess"". I was sceptical in the begging. 
But when my dad found out, he told me to NEVER tell anyone. Which confirmed that it was true. 
I was mad. On top of that... I was bullied to the point of following me home and throwing rocks at me. 
When I was 11 (I believe 2 days after my birthday) 
We had a school trip. 
I was at the train station and needed to pee. 
But a 40ish yo man followed me. Attempted to r*pe me  but got interrupted by another person screaming at him to stop. The whole school trip was hell. Since... I hated everyone there. 
The first day back home.... My stepmother Ella was high on I don't even know... and was out of her mind.
I ran out my room and broke a Glas there. 
Then cut a deep wound in my arm. 
That was my coping mechanism. And to this day... In some was still is. 
Eventually we moved cities. New school.... New life.
Unfortunately it was even worse there (still at the same school these days btw).
My parents opened a restaurant.
I was forced to work 9 hours daily at the age of 12-14.
Didn't get a penny. At the same time my stepmother being high or drunk all the time.
I had it. I texted my mother a long message explaining everything. And that I love her forever. Then drank to the point of practical death. My blood was well... Replaced with vodka. Anyway I passed out in the bathroom and woke up in a hospital. No worries. Didn't get much damage. ""just"" an strong alcohol poisoning.
The worst part is... My parents (except my American mother) didn't care at all. ""let her do whatever"".
So yeah. Then I was in a psychiatric clinic for one week. And ovcource... I wasn't allowed to have therapy after. To This day... I'm waiting to finish german school and move to my mother. I hate my life here.
I have no friends... My father is a decent man. But is being manipulated by Ella. So fml.
Hope y'all are doing better :)",1616679386.0

Hearing all the cute things they did, and all his thoughts about her, like “she’s very sweet” or “her mascara was a mess because of the rain, but she was so cute”... it’s just toxic for me

249,I'm new to this sub but just need a friend...,"I recently starting dealing with depression and anxiety. I haven't virtually no friends to talk to about my problems. I feel like every time I try to talk about it with them... They don't listen or get annoyed but just don't want to say it. So, I end up in this dilemma where I NEED to talk about this issue because  I feel like doing... things, but I don't want to bother people and risk getting humiliated quietly. So, I tried to talk about it with my longest and closest friend. He helped me a bit, but I could tell after a while he was starting to get annoyed with my problems. It's most likely because I tend to say it in a way where I pity myself (almost like don't know the rest of the world exists), but that's how I feel. I've never been the type of person to pity myself or be self-centered, but I guess I see how it can come across that way. Today especially, I feel TERRIBLE! I feel extremely bored and don't know what to do, I'm thinking about how much of a useless person I am, and feel a LOT sadder than I would normally (without depression), I want to cry but I just can't. It's almost like my emotions are being bundled up inside like a tangled mess getting larger and worse. The only thing holding it together is a knot created by my mind. My mind knows what's best for me, but can't seem to do it. I have no motivation for anything. I feel useless because I haven't been productive in doing anything towards anyone or myself. It makes me feel worse knowing I feel terrible about it, but being too lazy to do anything about it. Me having depression never actually sunk in until now. I think... I was always scared to get depression, but never thought about it. 

&#x200B;

another thing, anytime I now try to talk to my close friend (I'm in a party night now), he just seems to ignore me. Instead, he just talks to his other friend in the party. Not even depression related either, just normal. But, when I try to leave the party cause there's no point to be in the party, he begs me to stay for no reason. I can't exactly blame him for ignoring me though... It must be pretty annoying to have me complain about having a bit bigger of a bump in my life than usual when everyone else is dealing with things on their own, but I somehow make it seem like mine is more important. (Even if I hate, hate, HATE to admit it, It just might actually be true that I think that deep inside. I hate myself for that...)

251,Just witnessed the aftermath of a car accident... but was too shocked to do anything/ bystander effect?,"I witnessed a car accident on the way home from a very long drive, maybe 15-20 minutes out from my apartment (5 hours in the dark). I wasn’t exactly sure of the location, since it is dark and the route is somewhat new to me. Trying to keep myself awake driving at 1 am, I saw in the middle of the highway what I thought was a concrete divider. It turned out to be a completely overturned white sedan. Other cars swerved out of the way and pulled into the shoulder nearby. I felt a weird sense of loss of control as I swerved, but didn’t pull over and continued, still processing what I saw. My tires bumped over debris from the wreck. I tried to replay over and over what I saw, trying to process it. I realized with shock that I should probably report it, knowing about the bystander effect. But by the time I got home and realized that I should have called 911 but felt like I’d be useless since I had honestly no idea where I was when I saw it, plus I feel as though time was surreal in the ?minutes? that passed by after I saw it. 
I didn’t see a body or anyone in the car, but I feel very afraid as whether or not I should’ve called. 
I hope those other cars that pulled over are reporting the wreck, as I assume they are but because of the bystander effect, I am wary. 
Now I can’t shake the thought that somehow, if someone got hurt, they could be dead because of me and how stupid I was in my shock.

252,how do i cope with this? how do i keep living with him? how can i get the motivation to improve myself and move forward? i feel stuck and hopeless,"Last night, bf said he got sad thinking about his past relationships, ""not necessarily romantic."" He told me about a girl ""laura"" who was dating his close friend. Bf and Laura were friends. They played twilight princess together. She read his favorite book, and it made her sad but she still read it.

Prior to this, he tried to make me play twilight princess. He tried to make me read the same book. Neither really stuck with me. He also showed me fire emblem and epic seven, both of which I now still play often. Still, he complains that we don't play games together (fall guys, ror2, bdo, tft, etc).

Laura and I studied the same major. In the beginning of the relationship hed talk about her a lot, with only the context that they were friends. He said he wished I could meet her and he thought we could be friends because we were both asian and both in the same major, but they fell out of touch. this was all i knew about laura prior to last night.

Bf admitted that he had feelings for laura even as she was dating his friend. he told both his friend and her how he felt and asked laura for space because of his feelings. They were at a party that night and got drunk. She came to his room. They kissed. Apparently it didn't go much further than that bc she felt guilty.

I said it felt like he was, even if subconsciously, trying to mold me into his ""dream girl."" He said is it so wrong to want to share my interests with my gf? And no, thats not wrong. And I HAVE caught onto some of his interests, but its never enough He told me how most of his love interests liked art or drew, and how it was strange to him that I had a passing interest in drawing. I do make art occasionally but I'm not really trained. I dont look at tutorials. I do it for my own enjoyment. And he wants me to develop more hobbies and ""do what I want"" but also wants me to actually look at tutorials instead of what I do now.

A few days ago, he asked me if I'd ever thought of dying my hair. he said he thought i would look good with brown highlights. I said yes I'd thought about it, but I probably wouldn't do so. My hair is black so any dying would require bleach. I looked up laura on Facebook. She has brown highlights.

He apologized if what he said was insensitive. Said he didn't mean to make me feel bad or that he didn't like me, but ""he needed to get it off his chest."" But I course i feel bad. This is not even the first time I've felt second best in a relationship. I guess I'm not interesting enough for people to see me as an individual, and to like me for that. I'm too negative, pessimistic, whiny, clingy, needy, emotional, hypocritical, stubborn, selfish, naive, childish. Yes, these are all things I've been called. I have tried to show interest in his things even though I feel like its not really reciprocated. I haven't pushed things onto him nearly as much as he unto me. And yet if I brought something like that up during one of these conversations, he would say that its ""not the same"" and that im ""reaching"" to deflect him

he doesn't really FORCE me to do things like play games or read the book. he's pushed it and he's repeatedly expressed his disappointment that i didn't pick up on them. it's not enough that i play epic seven and fire emblem. it feels like i need to play them all, and he misses being able to share those games with the girl he likes, which used to be her and is now, purportedly, me. laura is the one that got away. i'm with him now, have been for two years, and he wants laura, or for me to be more like her, even subconsciously.

bf and i live together and my family doesn't know that. i'm not close with my family but they'd take me in if i asked. but it is exhausting to deal with them. i'm stuck in a rock and a hard place. the pandemic makes moving harder as well. i feel really hurt by all i've learned and the other issues in our relationship, but also i feel like there's nothing else i can do. my plan is to find a job, hopefully in another state, and move out/break up with him then. not sure what to do about rent in this apartment either because we have both signed on to the lease (which has no exit clause), so i may just have to continue paying it until he finds another roommate. 

i know i should be applying to a lot of jobs, but applying is hard bc every company wants you to act like they're your dream company, so you have to put a lot of effort into your application only to get ghosted. and i know a lot of people are struggling  with finding work at the moment due to pandemic. i'm a fresh graduate with internship experiences, and entry level positions are being flooded at the moment.

other problems/info about our relationship:

1. we don't have the same ideals/values. he says he misses being able to debate people without them getting offended (and said he was able to debate civilly with laura). these ""debates"" feel like him picking a fight, playing devil's advocate, and refusing to see the sides of others (""i was bullied when i was younger and i grew tougher for it, so idk why i have to be so 'sensitive' about using certain words bc they're just words"")
2. pretty much our only common interest was anime. there's some anime we both like, mostly action and adventure, but he really likes slice of life and romcom, which i don't. i've made him watch my favorite anime (12 episodes, 1 season) and he in turn has introduced me to many others, including one of his favorites (25+ and counting). i've liked a lot of the anime he showed me, but this ""favorite"" of his really grinds my gears and it feels like pulling teeth to watch it. but i watch it anyway.
3. whenever we have a Big Talk, he makes me feel like im... wrong? like i dont know what im saying, or that i have unrealistic expectations, or that i'm not recognizing what he does for me. so it's hard. like i have trouble articulating what's wrong with our relationship. the easiest and most simple way i put it is that i think we're incompatible, and i've brought that up to him, but he disagrees.
4. i've had talks with him with the intention of breaking up several times over the course of our relationship, and he seems to say ""you could if you wanted to, but i still love you and i want to make things work."" and i don't think it's fair to quit at any bump in the road either, and he can recognize and apologize for things, which i recognize as good. but it feels like he doesn't commit to actually changing. he makes commitments to his stream viewers (i'm going to create more youtube content, i'm going to run a tournament, i'm going to stream more and longer) and friends (i'm going to start playing DND again weekly).  
as for me - he says sure we can spend more time together, but idk what we would DO bc you never want to do anything. so i've suggested reading the game story together (which we finally did last night after 1.5 weeks of postponement), and there's a lot of anime that we've started and not yet finished, but he's ""never in the mood"" for them. i wish we could go out more to do things but pandemic has made us both wary. so we're stuck inside and he wants me to game with him (some of the games i mentioned earlier) but i fucking suck at them. it's never just us, either; he'll invite a friend or two. i get annihilated early on and then just sit and watch as they finish out the game. that's not fun :/",1598286618.0
253,I am a stressed-out person who's basically unlucky and was just wondering how people deal? Practical advice/ encouragement and even healthy criticism are all welcome.,"Hello,

I'll explain my situation.

I have a big family many of my siblings are adopted from terrible situations which creates a really stressful environment. Having your younger brother describe his experience of being put into a mental hospital for ""low IQ"" and effectively tortured can break your heart especially when he's only 11and simultaneously pointing out stab wounds. That's just an example of something that I'd consider stressful and that I pretty much have to contemplate every day. I love my adopted siblings and I'll take care of them NO MATTER what, it's just a little tough. 

On top of that my family is plagued with medical issues everything from serious congenital heart defects to cancer. Two of my family members are scheduled for surgeries at this exact moment, one very serious, and one not so serious but still very sad. My mom has also had cancer twice and she just got checked up and they found more but removed it which is great but...It was there. So that kind of broke my heart too. Pretty stressful. My Grandpa also has cancer again and it's not looking that great.

So while the traumatic backgrounds and the challenges that arise because of that are constant, so are the medical issues. There's other stuff too. My relatives (including my grandpa) are manipulative and the opposite of loving so there's some serious relationships that I lack. Some other stressful stuff in my life  = 2020 the worst year of all time Lol. Depression. I just recently ""recovered"" from some pretty nasty stuff mentally. I go to school and that's stressful with the online format and the money involved but really that's small potatoes compared to everything else. 

Finally, I'm not that old and my methods of dealing with things are um. Horrible. They have delayed my life.

To tell you about my situation I'm struggling with my weight (I weigh at 60-65 kg as a 12 year old), my school and my peers. The biggest issue is my weight as I some times have hour breakdowns about how I constantly hide behind a happy mask even though I hate the fact that I know nobody truly likes me apart from my relatives. 

At school I feel horrible at a constant rate about my self because of how ugly I think I am and how nobody will ever show an interest for me which depresses me even more at times. 

I want somebody to help me and to tell me if I have a chance to grow up as a skinny person (I have a normal diet)so that I can be counted as a normal peer from others and not an example of an ugly monster.

259,"Help me cope: recently married to my high school sweetheart, pregnant, and hiding my depression","This is a really long post and a brain dump so I’m sorry for all the personal info, but here goes;

Hi. I’m a (33f) who just recently married her high school sweetheart (36m) after he served 11 years active duty in the military. He was previously married and has a child who is 12, but I feel he has a very healthy co-parenting relationship with his ex, and for all intensive purposes, a very respectful, well mannered and adjusted son. 

The issue is my partner and I got together about 3 years ago when I was going through some major life changes. I have always struggled with depression, but have managed to cope through excessively working, working out, and kind of living a party-girl lifestyle. From the outside looking in, I appeared to have my stuff together. And I really did have a lot of fun... but something was always missing. I was always looking for acceptance and love that I couldn’t find in other partners. 

When “Alex” and I got together three years ago, I had just gotten out of another year long experimental relationship where as per-usual it crashed and burned due to my inability to change my work and daily living habits. I couldn’t make room for anyone else (which was typical) and the relationship reached its end. But with Alex, that all changed. Soon he had moved in with me, we started making long-term plans, I helped him lose 65lbs, got him into school and “Boom” we were engaged. Flash-forward a year and a half from our engagement were married and I’m pregnant. 

Now, at the time, I felt like Alex brought a calm to me no one else did. He knew me from childhood, and had been in my life in some way shape or form for almost 2 decades. I believed he really knew me and I wasn’t trying to be perfect for him. I could breathe, not like in the other relationships I had been in where I felt like I had to constantly keep up appearances. But as I became more “comfortable” with myself, I also became more aware of my sadness, my tendency to not want to anything but sleep, and the realization I don’t really want to have this baby that’s due in a month, nor be a stepmother to a 12 year old (currently we only have his son in the summers, but will get him full time next year). Yes, I should have thought about all this before, but I don’t know, I think maybe I was suppressing these feelings. I’m not really sure. Reality hasn’t hit yet perhaps. 

Anyway, my husband is a wonderful guy, but suffers from PTSD, and has struggled to effectively transition into the civilian word. I work two jobs and he struggles to keep one. I am always trying to keep him going and focused on the goal ahead. He hasn’t gotten his degree yet and I have two advanced degrees so it’s easier for me to get a job and therefore, I tell him I don’t mind working additional side gigs, but that bruises his ego and just creates a riff between us. At home I do all the housework because I feel bad for the amount of mental stress he goes through at the job he’s currently working (he’s been working about 6 months but averages 10-12 hr days 6 days a week), so I try to take the load off of him by cooking, cleaning and caring for our (his) pet. I’m 8 months pregnant and all of this on top of work is starting to wear on me. He wants to quit everyday, but we need the money so I pep talk him and get him to go back to work. I can put on a happy face for him, but as soon as he’s gone to work, I succumb to crumbling depression. I have no one to talk to, most of gfs wouldn’t understand cause they married “money” and work out of choice, not out of obligation, or conversely they are so firery and independent they would just tell me to leave my husband —  and none of them know how bad he can get when something triggers him and he reverts back to military responses. 

I’ve been thinking about whether I could do better on my own, but I know he worries about that too and it stresses him out. I’m not even sure I’ve painted the whole story but yeah, I’m depressed. I have no attachment to the bundle I’m popping out in 4 weeks. I’m stressed about our finances (we paid for our wedding and that’s money that has to come from somewhere), I don’t want two kids, bollocks, I don’t think I want one, I can’t drink, I can’t smoke (yes I know that’s only temporary but I have no outlet) , I can’t talk to anyone about it, I can’t look at my husband sideways or he’ll spiral into depression and feel that he’s not doing his job as a man (every time I look slightly down, he apologizes about ruining my life — I don’t feel like he did), we are in hardcore conservation mode so no luxury spending occurring. I can’t run a 10k and feel better. And I damn sure can’t call an ex for a romp -  so what do I do? I’m turning to reddit for help and hoping I don’t  just die like a cut flower, but that’s kinda what I want.

I really need some advice so maybe someone who has advice sees this here. If you are reading this thank you for taking time out of your day reading my post. I really appreciate it. 


I'm not very well at the moment. I didn't get diagnosed yet but I'm psychologically not well. I don't want to say that I'm depressed because I'm not diagnosed because I'm too afraid to go to a doctor or smth. Yesterday a friend mentioned that she will be in a hospital for a few months which hit me pretty hard. Plus I have so many tests coming up in school but I can barely learn because when I have free time I likely visit my grandma who is in hospital because of health reasons. +I'm doing a course to become a paramedic. Because of the paramedic school I have to take classes every 2 weekends plus all vacations I have in school. So basically I can't get sleep for a few weeks until I get a weekend. Also the whole depression shit that is going on at the moment is really hard.

Next week is school free for most students. Except me because I have to take classes for the paramedic shit. I really love it but I could use some spare time. But because we don't have school next week the teachers expect every student to make progress in their 18 page long essay. But I simply don't have the time to do any of it. 

Point is I have so much to do and so less time. It's really hitting me hard. I'm at an all time low at the moment with all the stress depression and friends and family in hospitals. I really want to get to a psychiatrist or smth but I don't know how and everytime I mention to my parents that I'm not well they hold me a lecture about that they are stressed too and are doing everything for me so that I have time to learn. They seem really stressed to... Even more than I am. Now I feel bad because I know what they are doing for me and that I shouldn't even be stressed because they keep the house clean so that I don't have to and can learn.

I just don't know what to do anymore. It's just to much at the moment for me to handle. And nobody takes me serious. And it's the good right to not take me serious because most of the times their even more stressed than I am. Sometimes I think I'm just a little 18 year old overwhelmed by a little stress but I'm really worried this all will drive me insane. As I said I don't know what to do anymore do you have any advice for me pls",1572461430.0

270,I Hate My Husband,"Apparently this isn’t suitable for r/confession so I’ll try here.

I was sold a dream and delivered a nightmare. The man I married isn’t who I thought he was at all. My friends now refer to him as “Tiger Woods” because he seemed so perfect but wasn’t. We were very in love and very happy, I now have symptoms of ptsd.

When I was in my third trimester of pregnancy with his son he hesitated to put his phone down in front of me before taking a shower. In three years I had never gone through his phone and his hesitation was a huge red flag. What I found was awful. He had been having an affair with a married woman for ten years and was on dating apps. He didn’t bother to delete anything or use fake names, he knew I trusted him. 

I have no interest in hearing you should/should have left. Geez...I never thought of that concept? I thought I was doing the right thing at the time for everyone else. But, for me it was a horrible mistake. I simply thought I was doing the right thing by staying.

I’ve tried for a year and a half and have been gutted every single day. I’m on multiple medications, have a therapist and psychiatrist, and read self help books for fun. Does he come to therapy too? Of course not, that’s for “weak” people. Somehow he still says I’m the one not trying because I can’t move on. 

Well, I am moving on. I can’t do this anymore. I tried harder at this than I’ve ever tried at anything. It’s also been one of the worst experiences of my life. Maybe I deserved it somehow in the big cosmic scheme of things. I’m done suffering.",1542748972.0

272,"My mother is starving me and my insatiable love for food is the only reason I’m alive. I’m 15, what do I do with my life?","My mother starves me cause she thinks I’m obese, others call me “skinny”, so idk what to do. I have a problem with binging ig, cause my mom never let me eat anything that “brings joy”. And if she did, she’d tell me what a bitch (literally insert any word or slur) I am for “betraying her”, and doing the fucking ugly cry or beating the shit out of me. At some point I had bulimia, and she I’m pretty sure she knew, but thought it was funny, and degraded me even more. Then I stopped purging when I realised it’s pointless and I’m only getting bigger, so I just ate. Then I got sent to another country, where my religious fanatic father lives. That idiot lost (quit) his job and now went to Saudi to “cleanse his sins”. Lmao as if that would eliminate all your responsibilities. On top of that, my father tried to abuse me into his religion, actually that happened constantly throughout my life, but this year he almost broke my nose a couple of times. We fight a lot, I guess I have a physical advantage over my them both, but using it blindly would be irrational. Anyway back to my “obesity”. My father never bought proper unprocessed food, so couldn’t even cook anything very often. He is Indian, so instead of buying food, he just brought home whatever shit his friends gave him. And he isn’t poor. HE IS A FUCKING MILLIONARE. I understand if you wanna save up money for something, but he could at least buy some food, instead of taking something cheap and processed from fuck knows where. So now I went back to weee my mom lives for the summer break, and of course I gained weight because 1) my father would make a tantrum if I did anything, moved around the house for example, because in his eyes I’m supposed to be praying (lmao for what? Do I live to pray?) 2) we all know food is the easiest way to get dopamine and serotonin, so of course I came back to it, it didn’t even taste good, I just wanted to satisfy my hunger 3) I would take any opportunity to eat, for example once in school the staff had some meeting, and outside the class there was a box of bread (anyone could take it) and tea. I took a lot of bread home, ended up eating it all at once.
And also, since 6 my mom always called my obese; but recently she started sending me those old photos at me, telling me how skinny I was, and that she regrets wasting her time on “trying to maintain my figure” (lmao what? So that’s YOUR *achievement?*). I mean, she did make me run huge distances, I had to run 10 km almost everyday at 9-10, and if I didn’t, I wasn’t allowed to eat (maybe a carrot or cucumber, but she would make a tantrum if I took plain yogurt). 
I can’t really phrase a text properly because I am really hungry right now and I mukbangs or food videos don’t really help anymore. She also made me go “burn some calories” while it’s raining, and is watching me right now through “find my iPhone”, and if I stop for more than 3 mins she calls me. Of course I could turn data off, but then she’ll throw another tantrum. And all because I added a little bit of plain rice to the tomatoes(because I honestly couldn’t bear it anymore), and my sister didn’t want to finish her spaghetti (it wasn’t even spaghetti, it was just 4 plain noodles left), so instead of wasting it I decided to eat it. And damn is she mad right now. Man I’d love to get a job rn and get some money to buy myself something nice and warm, without fear that someone is gonna bother me, but I’m 15, so no one’s gonna give me a job, and most likely my mom would know, and take those money from me, so that I wouldn’t buy food. Please tell me what to do, most likely no one’s gonna give a shit since I’m not underweight. She keeps buying “normal” food and it’s it and gives my sister the biggest sweetest ice cream just to tease me. Makes me wanna take it from my mother and shove it down her throat so she chokes on it. 
Man I’d eat anything right now, burnt onions, bread, anything. I think my amygdala is messed up, now I just feel constant insatiable hunger. She also made me take sibutramine (idk what it’s properly called in English, but it is moderately psychotropic, from what I know. She has friends who could give her the prescription without any examination. So yeah, I guess that made it even worse). Idk what else to say or do
Also I can’t find those picture she constantly refers to today as “remember when you were skinny and beautiful”. And, well, tbh I don’t give a shit about what I look like. I just want to satisfy my hunger, I think that’s the only reason I keep living",1660993673.0

280,I let my much older married boss sleep in my hotel bed when I was blackout drunk and can’t stop feeling disgusted and ashamed,"A few nights ago after a work night out where all the staff were put up in a hotel, I woke up with my (21F) boss (40s M) in my bed next to me.

I don’t remember the last half of the night let alone going to bed but i was fully clothed and on top of the duvet under a small blanket. He had taken off his shirt and trousers to sleep. He admitted to me that he tried to have sex with me but i was not having it at all, and admitted he was having a lot of trouble in his marriage. 

I know that I didnt do anything to encourage him because I don’t find him appealing in any way whatsover, and the fact that he thought it was appropriate to try and seduce me in that state says more about him than it does me. 

However, I can’t help feeling such a disgusting feeling of guilt and shame that I was in such a bad way that I let that happen, or that in my state I did not send him packing! 

To make matters worse when I woke up and realised the situation I was in I didnt immediately kick him out or anything, and he kept kissing my arm. When I got up and went to the bathroom to change to go to work, he kept calling me back and saying he needed cuddles?!

I dont remember what happened so I am not sure whether we kissed or not, but I have a feeling I did allow us to spoon. He has a beard so i feel like i would be able to tell if we had kissed (mouth and face would be red and irritated due to sensitive skin).. but i dont know why he woke up and thought something more was still going to happen the next morning? I feel like he now thinks there is something between us, or that i have consensual feelings?? I feel the complete opposite. 

We’ve had to work together for the pst few days and every time I see him I want to get sick because of how wrong it feels. I think to him I am a younger fit woman he would happily have an affair with but to me he is more like a father/uncle and it feels so inherently wrong that he slept over or that I allowed any of this to happen.

I feel like i need to quit so I can pretend none of this ever happened",1631892034.0

282,I’m suicidal but I have Covid,"I have an incredibly long history which I’d rather not explain right now, but my usual method to help me get past my suicidal thoughts is to have friends come over or I go see them. I have COVID and can’t leave my apartment. How do I stop being suicidal on my own? I refuse to call the help lines cause they’re useless for me. Tried and got frustrated every time.

Edit: for a bit of context, my ex-wife emotionally abused me for 6 years. She also cheated on me several times. We have two kids together. After the divorce, she would call me often in tears wishing she didn’t screw up so much and we could still be married (she’s the one who called for the divorce). We often saw each other intimately after the divorce because she kept saying she wanted to see if we could work things out. She’s now dating and in love with someone new who’s apparently so good to our little girls and they love him etc. happy happy happy they all are. Then there’s me, completely destroyed by everything that transpired over the past 7 years. Being manipulated, lied to, cheated on, etc. how can she already be moved on and in love with someone after almost no time having gone by, when I’m now thinking of how to get my guns back from a buddy without arousing suspicion. Like, I know life is unfair, but this is just straight up horseshit. I can’t even FaceTime my girls without them asking about me and mom getting back together. I can’t see them without bawling my eyes out because I’m just so broken now. I used to be a fun-loving, hopeless romantic, happy person.

284,The people I love don’t love me back and it’s killing me (TW),"In 2015, I was happy for the first time in my life. I was 24, skinny, blonde, beautiful, I had worked so hard to finally beat my binge eating disorder that I had developed in my abusive home. I was on my second year of uni and my future looked bright.

I dated a wonderful man, S. I had lots of friends. I had a good friend, also S, and my boyfriend’s best friend, P.

My life was complete.

During our relationship, I started taking the pill. I didn’t realize how badly I took the side-effects, sinking into a deep depression that I couldn’t help myself out of. I also cared for my abusive family and lost out on a lot of happy times due to that.

I lost my friends. P, that I had started to fall for almost against my own will, had a fight with S and left. Everyone was suddenly gone and from 2016-2019, I lived in constant sadness and emptiness, I became a shell of myself. When I stopped taking the pill end of 2019, I became me again. Finally.

I realized I had had feelings for P, and that S maybe wasn’t all that nice. I found P against all odds and he became part of my life again.

All of last summer, P and S fought like lions over me without ever asking me what I wanted. S threatened suicide if I wasn’t intimate w him once P and I got closer - this shook me so deeply that I felt I had no choice but I didn’t want to. I wanted to get to know P better. The man I had missed for so long. The years before that, S hadn’t shown any interest in me at all.

Eventually, we all had a huge falling out. P left, this time forever, and S said some terrible things to me. I realized I don’t mean anything much to the people I love most. S (other friend) doesn’t talk to me much, if I don’t text him he never reaches out and we are friendly, but cool. P was the only one, I felt, who understood how empty I feel. Him leaving again broke my spirit so deeply that I have given up on life. I have to be honest, I don’t see a reason to continue it.

I have no family, my health is declining and my mental health is low even though I’ve been in therapy for a long time. I worked hard on myself since P left, I wrote him a letter when I felt I was stable enough to do so without annoying him. S and I went our separate ways after him telling me that he wouldn’t be all that sad if I were gone.

All of last summer, I was a queen w two kingdoms. Now, I am just a lost girl who is 30, but who feels helpless. I lost my job and I’m not sure if it’s P who’s visiting my apartment or a dangerous ex-friend who stalked me before and who threatened me w violence.

I have to be honest: I see no reason not to die.

If no miracle happens, I will be gone.

P, S and S were the three pillars of my happiness; they were my whole life since 2014. I lost everyone else and I lived. But I won’t survive this, not if P doesn’t return. I... can’t start over again.

I don’t know if anyone reads this but I’ve heard everything and I don’t want to start over alone one more time, I come from a broken home and violence is all I know. These people were my happy place and I can no longer pretend I’m okay.",1620502287.0

I could tell a whole story about how I feel but that would be time consuming. So I’ll keep it short.Basically every areas of my life is a faliure. I had hopes and dreams of becoming an artist after I finished school  but have failed close to 100-200 times just being on my second art piece. Backstory I have always liked art and have been studying it all throughout high-school both art and design, and I couldn’t say I’d rather be doing something else. However me failing in almost every other category of my life is beginning to scare me, and the reason why I have been slacking and doubting myself in art.

Ok let me give you a quick rundown of what I planned out and did not go my way. I have been applying ever since I was eligible for a job at 15 and have never got a successful interview therefore I have never had a job at 18 years old. I have was planning to move out at first 18-21 as growing up I saw and was involved in a lot of domestic violence that my brothers with drug and alcohol addiction brought into the home. I gave my last year of high school my best effort, but my results did not show therefore I may not be accepted into a course that I want to do next year. Also ever since last year but especially this year  my friend groups have showed me no loyalty. And so I have been stuck in a rut for a while as I do not trust anyone because they turn their backs everytime I want to hang out or just want someone to talk to. I do not drink smoke or do any drugs, I have drank before but choose not to do it because I have seen what it does to people and also see the hangovers are not worth it as I like to stay productive.

I feel worthless, I’m not suicidal and greatful for that but I do not know what  to do with my life at this point, as I have so much to fix. I have pretty much concealed my emotions from my surroundings for the last 2 years and so when something bad happens it really hits hard.",1606305832.0
292,No enjoyment in life at all,"Hi,

I’m a 17 year old guy living in Ireland. I can’t find any enjoyment in my life at all. Every single thing is very depressing.

The worst problem is loneliness. I have absolutely no friends. At school, I’ve been bullied, excluded and ignored many times. Every single day, I absolutely dread going to school. I just can’t make friends and nobody likes me. I live in a small town so there aren’t any other schools. I hate living in a small town in Ireland, I feel so trapped. I wish I could live in a big city in America like New York or Los Angeles where I could easily make friends. I can’t make friends outside of school, because there’s no clubs or anything because of covid and there’s very little going on in a town anyway.

Another problem is schoolwork. I’m so overwhelmed with the amount of homework and exams. I have no free time. I can’t focus during study so it takes me a long time. When I get home from school, I study until midnight and on weekends I study for the full day. I never leave the house. I feel like I’m wasting my teenage years on schoolwork. I’m getting very little sleep.

Another problem is anxiety. I have hypochondria or health anxiety and that’s honestly becoming a problem in my life.

Also, this last part would probably be better for another subreddit. But I’m a Christian, and I don’t have anyone I can talk to about Christianity related things. That is really disheartening.

Because of all these problems, there is no enjoyment in my life at all. I know this subreddit probably receives a load of posts like these a day, but I’m hoping I’ll get a few responses. Thanks.",1605804422.0
293,I feel like I don't deserve these chances,"Hello, 

This is my first post to reddit, like ever. I was just looking for a place to vent. I just finished college and am starting a PhD soon. While everyone says I shoukd be happy and that I will do great, I can't help but feel sad. I'm sad that school is over and afraid of the responsibility that I will have to take on now. I don't feel like I deserve these chances and opportunities. I'm not as smart as everyone thinks, I was just good at studying. 

Furthermore, I also have the tendency to compare myself to everyone around me. For example... I'm now doing a summer internship in the same place that my PhD will be. I still go home to my family in the weekends, and since it is quite far away, I leave in the early afternoon on friday. Every friday I feel bad about leaving, because other people are still in the lab. Even though I do my analysis on the train and am technically still working, I always feel like a bad researcher. Because I hear that some people work every day, even in the weekends and this makes me feel like I should to if I want to be a good researcher. However, if I don't go home, I feel extremely sad and lonely. 

I don't know how to stop these feelings. I feek so inadequate and sometimes I just wishes a meteorite to hit the earth so I can die without letting anybody down. So I don't have to grow up and take this responsibility. Or just someone who tells me what to do every minute of every day, could work as well. 

I hope there is someone out there who reads this and understands. Or someone who can give advice how to cope with these feelings.  I know this post is all over the place, but I just needed to let go for a moment. 

Thank you.",1597853595.0

**The Miracle of Mindfullness**

*An introduction to the practice of meditation*

By Thich Naht Hanh


I feel like I've tried every technique in the world, as well as half the medications under the sun.

Nothing else can even compare impact made by this book.

It's less than 150 pages long and you are encouraged to only read a few pages a night, but I saw a big difference after just a few days.

And as a biomedical engineer I can verify that alot of the things he discussed in the book can be backed by loads of scientific research. Especially with what he says about the mechanisms of breathing as well as the stability of sitting in the lotus position.

I implore anyone, and everyone to read this book.

If I had the money, I would send each and every one of you a copy.

296,Death of á friend and family member - hard time coping - I feel I’ve lost myself and don’t know who I am anymore,"I’m feeling completely broken. I’m feelings worse then I expected I would feel. My friend who died was only 35 and had 3 young children and her whole life in front of her. But she was addicted to pills, a whole cocktail of them. There were atleast painkillers involved but since she lied to me so much in the end I have no idea what else she was taken. I used to be the one to get her painkillers and “sleeping” pills but put a stop to the painkillers a few months ago when I saw she was losing control. She has been really sick lately and everyone around her had noticed. She could barely walk, she slurred her words, she was confused and often very near falling down or collapsing.
This wasn’t really a surprise, I know this would be the end if she didn’t stop. She just came home from rehab and went straight into the pills again.
I can’t really understand where she got all those pills she was taking these last few days, if she stole them or someone supplied her.
I should have made more of an effort to stop others from selling to her but I guess it’s to late now.
I haven’t been paying enough attention lately because I have my own problems and I missed the warning signs
I felt so possitive when she decided to go to rehab and she was so optimistic about it but the rehab center thought she was to psychically I’ll to participate in the extra program and they sent her alone into the world. Her boyfriend took her to the ER her last night and wanted to have her admitted but all th beds were full and they sent her home. She was already dead by the morning after and I wish they would have admitted her and cared for her because that was what she really needed. The kind of medical help she needed just isn’t available here. She needed to be fully hospitalized and under observation because her body has been slowly shutting down for a while now.
Hopefully she’s in a better place now and hopefully one day I’ll be able to live with the guilt of having helped her out sometimes and not been there for her in her last hours of need. I will need to focus on forgiving myself and let go of the guilt. I know that whatever I had done or tried to do, this was always going to be the final outcome. There comes the day an addict takes his last pill and everything comes to an end. It’s the inevitable end in this situation.
Now I’m scared I’ll fall down the same hole and the addiction in me wins that I’ve been keeping at bay for a long time. I was finally mentally stable, happy and safe and I thought I had found my purpose and calling in life but now I’m having doubts about everything.
Who am I? Am I good or bad? Will I survive or will one of my many illnesses be the death of me? Will I die young? Could life be almost over and I just don’t know it?
This was such a harsh reminder that some people get their life cut short way to early and never get to finish their journey.
I want many more years. I want happiness, fun, love, trust and safety in my life again. I want to love myself again. I don’t want to doubt if I’m good or bad. I’ve always been considered one of the kindest and most honest and supportive person people know but it can sometimes be straining on me to be the one everyone relies on.
Now I wonder, who do I rely on when I my self am feeling week.
Who is there to catch me like I’m always ready to catch those I love.
Who’s going to talk some sense into me and help me find my self again.
Is it sometimes okay to ignore other people’s problems while I deal with mine because doing it all is breaking me to the ground.
This has been an extremely hard day and night and I’ve been crying, overthinking and self hating for hours now, lying beside my sleeping friend.
I wish the was rest in store for me but I think my mind won’t let me sleep this night and I guess I will just have to survive that
I really want to talk to someone, to be held and comforted, but as my good friend is in a hard place himself right now I can’t open myself to him because I don’t want to break him and make him feel even worse.
Where is everyone I love and care about now at this moment when I really need support, when I really need a pep talk, a hug or just a kind word to push me through the pain
I guess I’ll just have to try to be strong and help myself and try to build my self up and be strong for myself because I don’t think anyone I know is ready to take on that task.
I know this is a long read but I’ve just had it really hard and I took this far worse than I could have ever imagined. I who I thought was used to death and suffering, I who always keeps a straight lip and stays strong through all the pain and suffering is suddenly now experiencing an event that was to hard and to big for my emotional state.

297,I feel like I’m creeping back into depression and I don’t know how to stop bad habits.,"I had depression about 2 years ago. Got better, my mindset change and I wasn’t as sad but now I’m having the same kind of thoughts I used to have. I didn’t like my major at the time so I told myself “it doesn’t matter you hate work so you won’t like any job you have. You only have four years too late to change” Well I knew my choice was risky and now I’m stressed in a job I don’t care for and about to be laid off. So my old mantras don’t work anymore because they caught up to me.

 I was also depressed then because I didn’t have friends. I still don’t because I’m still afraid of them rejecting me. And I have a boyfriend now so I can’t use sex to get friends. And even when I do find other girls I can talk to the boys they’re friends with make me uncomfortable and then I leave. Now I feel like the same loser I was then because I don’t want to slip into my boyfriends friendgroup.

I know I might need therapy again but last time I got better without her. Literally I stopped seeing a therapist and stopped taking the meds that made me sick and I got better. But I can’t stop my self harm. I’m too creative for my own good. Everything can be used for self harm. I just hit myself with a round bristled brush. It was just the closest thing. Its like instinct if I don’t deal my emotions my subconscious will do it for me.

 I know it sounds bad it just feels like leftover problems I don’t know how to solve. And I want help before I completely lose faith in myself.",1596681986.0
298,My father (48m) said he would rather go on a holiday than see me (23f).,"So a little backstory. My father was always absent, making up excuses about having to work (he took massive overtime, cuz he's a workaholic), being tired after work or having to attend to his hobbies. Me and my younger brother were practically raised by him. 

Later on in my life, 3 years after me leaving to study in a different country, exactly 3 days before me coming to visit my home country I get news about my father deciding to leave us. He slept in my bedroom for 6 months before he told my mum, essentially submitting her to psychological torture, being cold to her and not explaining why he's acting mean to her. After that he stayed for about 3 more months before he left my household, automatically holding it over our heads (I really want to keep the house and he knows it, but he says that my mother can't live there if he can't live there). 

It occurred to us that he was cheating on my mum emotionally, by attempting to date multiple woman. He was unsuccessful until he found a woman who lives across the country. He now visits her almost weekly, which also presses him on money. When the whole thing went down, my mother signed an agreement with him that would be legally binding in my country that he has to pay money monthly to me and my brother. Due to his frequent travel he is now emotionally manipulating us into not sending us the money, he wants to spend on his new girlfriend and her children. 

Back to the main issue:

My father is now in holiday season as he works as a special needs teacher. He, therefore has more time than ever. He is frequently visiting his woman (now he lied to me that he is going for a fishing trip to a well-known location and there won't be any cellphone reception there. My mum also found a post by his girlfriend placing her in the exact same place at the exact same time as my dad. So, again he lied). 

I told my father I wanted to go back to my home country to visit so I could renew my passport and get away from the lockdown bumdown that we are all experiencing right now. 

I told him the dates and he got agitated saying that he has already holiday planned with his friend (the pattern of lies suggests he'll be with his girlfriend) and that he cannot move it, because it is pre-planned. 

Now, I told him that it is a bit unfair, considering that I usually visit my home country 2 times a year at most. I genuinely thought he would make some time for me, as I am his daughter and he claims to be so proud of me and my achievements. 

Then, he started yelling at me, repeating the same argument and saying I can't just come like that when he is on holidays. 

I interrupted him and said that 1) he will not yell at me, because those tricks are not working; 2) I am his daughter and he WILL make time for me. I clearly showed him that he cannot manipulate me this time and that he should take accountability for his family. He has his friend whole year, I come there 2 times a year for maybe a month in total. 

Basically the issue is that I do not know what to do with his behaviour anymore. I got multiple advice that said the same thing: cut him off. This does not feel right for me, even though I am so disappointed with him and how he acted towards me. It is clear to me he wants me out of his life ASAP. I also know he wants to move to live with his girlfriend- an information spilled to me by his best friend he uses as an excuse to see his woman. 

This situation is a shitshow. I do not know what to do, what to think, how to act... He is supposed to be my father, the adult that shows me how life is, but it turns out I am the on acting like an adult in this situation. He just runs away and doesn't want to face the consequences of his choices. He burns all the bridges, spews lies left and right, harms me, my mother and my brother and then pretends as if nothing happened when he takes my brother to the city on Sundays (when he is not visiting his GF). 

I am utterly disgusted with his behaviour and I cannot get over it. Please, help me understand my position here and work out what I could do.",1594751512.0

So to satar the topic in front, I'm a 22 years old (almost 23) man and I'm still a virgin. The main problem is that people are always trying to ask me if I am one (virgin), I already tried to lie or fake that I'm not listening but this people hut me. They are not my friends but friends of friends, also they try to bring me down in front of other people. And the so called ""my friends"" that are with them don't help and sometimes do even worse. 
A example of this is that ""my friends"" try to arrange things with girls that don't attract me either physically or mentally. I tried to explain that if I don't feel attraction I will not ""bang"" {sorry for the bad language ahaha} but they judge saying thing like ""your gay"", ""you will stay virgin forever"" or even  make fun of me in front of everybody ""go home masturbate is all you do""

**im not homophobic or anything like that, I have gaybfrirnd and I respect them. The thin is that I don't have faith with my ""loving skills""


My love life isn't that great. I never had a girl, but I have fallen within love with some.

One of them was a best friend girl (but it got solved with both and I'm still friends with them).

The last girl I fallen for, it broke my heart so bad because for the past 3/4 yesrs, whenever she nedded me I was there(taking care of hers over drunk times/bad time university or family and even health) and them puff she sends me a text that she doesn't want me but still want to be friends with me (because I took care of her) and then I find out she started dating a guy a couple months ago. The main thing with this girl is that she showed me sign of love threw me (hugs&kisses) but then she would go beyond my mind to say that she wouldn't date me because I have the same name as one of her ex... 

All this to say that I don't fell good with my love life either because of a fucked up past ( to fallen with a bf girl) or that people try to mentally abuse me. 
I try to talk to girls with instagram but does work so well. 
I'm becoming more melancholyc everyday that it passes.

302,I think i have mental issues (18F),"I've never had problems in school or learning but I think that I'm emotionally inept. For example I get upset easily over small things but don't know how to translate my feelings. I've been questioning this stuff for years but most recently everyone I live with went away for the weekend to the lake while I stayed home by myself. Not a big deal that I couldn't go because I have work but it still felt weird to be home alone. Tonight one of them was supposed to return but they decided not to and didn't bother to message me back, I was really worried. (Someone else told me what the situation was). On top of all of this my sister and her boyfriend went out tonight with some friends that we share (including my ex). I just see everyone's post on social media about all the fun they're having and I can't help but feeling alone and abandoned. I don't have many friends and my social circle is small. I don't have anyone to talk to these feelings about so I've been crying for a couple hours. It feels totally irrational but I don't know what else to do.

304,"I don't want to be sensitive. I just want to be unfeeling, like everyone else.","Nobody else is this sensitive. Oh but it's good to be, you say.

No.

Everything sets me off. Everything I read, see, hear about, or even imagine, upsets me. More than just being *triggered* dank meme style. I get instantaneous physical reactions. I shake, I cry, I hurt myself. I get nauseous, I dry heave, I get splitting headaches and body aches, I get chills and sweats. Any and every piece of bad news, ranging from less bad to catastrophic, from school bullies at high schools cyberbullying (I am a college grad) to the 983819173781947746188472nd shooting spree, to hurricanes and tragedies. To any and every piece of violent media, (except for obvious fantasy settings) ranging from mildly annoying sitcom to torture porn. To my stupid fucking damaged diseased damaged brain, it might as well be all the same. I can't even kill bugs anymore. Dead baby jokes aren't funny anymore. I'm starting to feel criminally guilty for breathing air because it could have gone to somebody else.

Nobody knows about this. Nobody can know that I cry in every movie, and I really do mean every movie. Nobody knows that I use painkillers primarily to deaden some of the feelings, good and bad, that I feel from the world. Nobody knows that I am even sensitive to people trying to identify me with a group. Being considered female, Asian, etc. Irrationally feels like thousands of firey spiders crawl under my skin. Nobody knows that I have to cry myself to sleep at least three times a month to get exhausted enough to pass out without freaking out. Nobody knows that I deprive myself of sleep every night to have a handful of nights where I can avoid seeing things my useless brain conjures in the dark, the memories it constantly brings up, the fears in my way. Nobody knows that I am one step away from running into traffic at any given moment. Nobody knows, because at the very least I'm fortunate enough to be able to act like I have everything together and that nothing's wrong, because it isn't, you see. Nothing is wrong and I am perfect and there is nothing to see here. The eight therapists I saw in my couldn't help because there is nothing truly wrong with me, you see. Besides, getting a diagnosis would hurt my career, because the working world has no place for what is just inside my head.

I live in a privileged part of America, in a nice suburban area. I have a life goal and career I am perfectly capable of going towards, and I do. I have a loving, caring family who are there despite all the times I fucked up. I refuse to burden them with me anymore, I don't want to be a reason for their stress anymore. I want to give back to them. I want to end all the suffering I can.

When I am happy...it does feel wonderful. I feel full of light and life seems clear. But it takes merely a feather to brush against my aching brain in order to bring the constant pain rushing back.

I want so badly to not feel. Nobody else does. I want to be able to enjoy torture porn and not have nightmares for six months. I want to see soap operas without feeling like dying when they scream at each other. I'm fucking insane. Help me.

307,"I'm abusive and a bad person, What do I do?","\[19/F\]  
Hello, I'm what's called the ""Crazy Girlfriend.""  
I'm emotionally abusive to my BF and physically abusive to myself.

My paranoia of others talking about us behind our back is overwhelming and out of fear of being alone again, I'm forcibly with my BF practically 24/7.  We've been together for almost 4 years and he has seen me spiral into what I am now.

He tells me he chooses to stay with me because he believes I can be fixed with therapy and medicine. He believes that therapy helped but, I would instead flip flop between weeks. Due to complications, we haven't been able to do medicine.

Due to the virus, I haven't seen my therapist in a long while and I've gotten worse. I don't enjoy anything we do or anybody we speak to. This has even translated towards him so, I've tried to dedicate time to where I am by myself. When by myself though, I become extremely anxious to the point of hurting myself. 

I'm ignorant, retarded, and childish. I hate myself and everybody around me. Everyday is a cycle of me getting aggressively abusive, overwhelmingly anxious, and drained. 

I know and understand the origins of my paranoia and aggression. I know it's unreasonable but I cant bring myself to settle with them. The only solution in my mind is to just leave everybody involved and start over.",1585762783.0
308,Everything is going to pieces in my life at the moment.,"I hope someone here has some advice for me here I could really use some.

So I have been struggling with untreated mental health problems. I did a lot of self harm, had a really low self esteem and suicidal thoughts. But I really got my life back on track. I structured out my life, did a lot of sport and creative work. And things were really paying off because I could slowly see the muscle gains and people gave me compliments for the songs I wrote. Life was really going uphill. I still had a few throwbacks, mostly during school breaks because in that period all structure was gone. Without the structure of school, sports, Hobbys I fell back into my own habits. That's why I always hated school brakes. But generally I really got my shit together. And then Corona happened. School closed down, gyms closed down, you can't meet your friends and I certainly can't go out. I live in Germany btw we closed down everything. Now every structure is gone. I got nothing left. And I can notice that slowly my old habits come back worse then ever.
I'm afraid that in the next 5 weeks of quarantine I will fall into a hole I can't climb out anymore.

But that's just one problem. My grandma suffers from cancer for 3 years now and while I'm pretty optimistic about sick people it really looks like it's going to end in the next weeks. She moved in to our family because she can't live alone anymore. She can't walk or eat Properly. It is really time consuming helping her and I can see the effect it has on my parents. It is devastating.
But my other grandma has severe issues to. She has severe back pain issues and is now in hospital after we found her screaming in pain several times.

All that happens while Corona spreads itself rapidly. As you might have noticed I have a very sick family. My dad had a heart attack several years ago and would probably have problems dealing with Corona as well as my grandmas

313,Fear of sex/dating and I'm [M/29] ashamed of myself (looking for advice),"TW: Child abuse

So I grew up with my mother and father, which had many issues on their relationship. Their attitude towards me was to ""advice"" me in a very very toxic way, some stuff like ""If you really want to make money and be sucessfull, don't get married, women are just made to steal men's money"" or ""The only reason any women wants to date a man is to get pregant and make some money"".

When I was 14 years old I still didn't had any experience with sex or had my first kiss, my father thought it was a great idea do invite a much older prostitute to have sex with me so I ""will stop being a kid and start being a man"".

I don't remember much of this episode but I remember being unconfortable, and I am really questioning myself If I was ""forced"" to do it, because I was looking for some approval of my father or something like that. Def this episode fucked my mind.

A couple of years later, most of the time that my parents sees me dating someone, the whole ""she is gonna get pregnant"" stuff starts, and I don't remember any relationship that I had that they approved 100%. This pressure of my parents made me feel even less hopeful to engange in a relationship.

At one point of my life, I installed Tinder and had a couple of dates, this is when things started to go weird. I have an engineering major, I like to watch soccer, drink beer with my friends and I also like Heavy Metal. But I've noticed that on most of those dates most of those characteristics started to be associated with ""hetero male toxic behaviour"" even if, at first glance, they were not! So I started listening some stuff like ""The engineering major is full of abusive men"", ""Heavy Metal is just for conservatives"", ""beer is such a straight male thing"" and so on, throught the years that I have used Tinder, this is what I have listen on around 70% of the time, to the point that norwadays I start to fell ashamed of myself and developed fear to have any contact because of the heavy judgement towards me. 

Most of the time that I tell this part of the story the main advice is ""this is an isolated case"" or ""this is just crazy people the world is not like that"" but it happened so much in my life that I doubt it. Also I see a lot of pages doing memes about the same thing.

In one of those Tinder dates, even though I was wearing condoms and took all the necessary caution to avoid any STD/pregnancy, her period got late about a week, during this time the psychological pressure increased so much to the point that I was not able to even say a word to her and she keept accusing me of being ""the classic men who abandons the child"". I didn't had the strength to deal with this episode and I feel bad about it.

After that, I had at least other 8 similar episodes in an interval of 3 years, the episodes varied from longer times without period to the point that I developed so much anxiety that the girl asked ""why I was not horny anymone"", even though I made very clear that I was having a week-long breakdown having trouble sleeping, eating or even working, it is hard to stay horny and erect in those conditions.

This whole experience with sex made me feel paranoid, I started noticing that I don't feel pleasure anymore on sexual relationships and I feel guilty about most of my pleasures because I have the fear to be the ""abusive macho"" that I was called so many times. I don't masturbate, I don't picture anyone in my mind when I do, started to feel guilty about penetration, about receiving oral sex and much more stuff.

I have heard also a lot of complaints from those dates about how bad it is for me to engage on conversations, hold hands, or any stuff like that because this ""creates a bad expectation on the women I date"", because ""engage on conversations is a charachteristic of someone who wants more than just one night stand"". Some even don't understand why I am a ""cute macho"".

This whole episode developed on me a constant fear of any sex contact with any person, or even kissing, I feel really affraid even to hug someone that I am dating while kissing and create an expectation that I want something ""more than a date"".

Norwadays, I have closed myself to any possibility of date/one night stand/relationship, which I feel is a good thing for now because I can focus on my mental health, but is a bad thing because isolation can lead to bad things like depression.

And even when I decide to face my fears and look for sex, I always question myself if this is a ""need"" or just how men are grown to believe that sex is the answers of all problems.

Not just the ""pregnancy paranoia"" makes me freeze on any date, but also how so many women expect me to behave like the ""cold-blood-sex-stallion-no-feelings"" kinda of guy makes me feel bad as well.

I can't work, so I'm stuck living with an abusive parent for the rest of my life.

319,I yelled at my mom over text and then blocked her. Im 15 and in foster care.,"God help me
Okay I'm going to start from the beginning but I'm gonna make it short. This is also my first ever reddit post but needed to vent and I know this is a good place to do so.
So my mom and dad are drug and alcohol addicts.
And decided not to get married but have a daughter while my dad was involved in some shady stuff. This was 15 years ago, long story short it didn't work out too well.
He got caught doing some stuff and went to jail for the first 9 months of my life (out of womb) my mom said she would wait for him, she did not and went to live with her mother and first child (who was male 4 year old with a different dad) and for the next 3 years we lived okay (or so me a 3 year old thought) but my mom and grandma hated each other and kept getting in fights and calling the police on each other so the state (finally) decided it wasn't safe for me or my brother and sent him to his dad, my mom to jail, and were going to put me in foster care if it were not for my moms sister and her husband who took me in.
Don't get me wrong I had visited them before this so I already kinda knew them. And I loved living with them, but when my mom and dad came back it got complicated. I was little so I didn't understand what they were doing but my aunt did. They would visit just every so often and be so nice to me and give me gifts so that when they did something without me knowing and my aunt would get angry with them I would take there side. That's some fucked up manipulated shit right there. They made me a little innocent girl blame my wonderful aunt for everything, they made me hate her. That fucked me up real bad (crying while writing this). And all the other manipulative stuff they did to me made it worse. 
And do you know what's even more fucked up they are still doing it to this day. MY AUNT GOT CANCER WHEN I WAS 10 AND TWO YEARS AGO SHE DIED AND THEY ARE STILL BLAMING HER FOR TAKING ME AWAY FROM THEM. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT BROKE ME!? I FINALLY STARTED TO BOND WITH HER AND UNDERSTAND AND SHE GETS CANCER AND DIES AND THEY STILL BLAME HER!!!??? WHAT THE FUCK!? I GOT CLINICAL DEPRESSION BECAUSE OF THIS AND THEY STILL WONT LET IT GO. I cut my self for 3 years and they still only care about that.
I finally understand what my aunt was doing for me but im a little to late because
1. Shes dead
2. Im a clinically depressed 15 year old
3. My mom and dad don't care and still blame her
4. I'm in foster care and
5. it's almost 2020
First of all it was YOUR own damn fault for me being taken.
Second of all have you no sympathy?!
Lastly I'm a child and don't you know how much that hurts?
I'm now 15 and I've been in foster care sense may 31 2019.
Im about to be adopted by my uncle's son (aunts husbands son) he's like my big brother and his wife os so nice and there baby girl just turned 1 (I've always wanted a sister) 
And my dad wont leave me alone and he was outraged when he learned they lived in England (he couldn't do shit about it) and my mom oh god my mom
My mom is still a drug and alcohol addict and is also a bipolar scorpio. So yeah I have to deal with this
So now that the short version of that is done I can tell you what just happened
My mom and dad have been texting me non-stop for weeks and I'm not in the mood for this shit. And I've told them that but they still want to talk to their baby. 😀😒
But ignore my dad and let me tell you about what my mother has been saying

But today she called and called but then she said this one little line
I'm coming to see you because I know your visiting your uncle.
Then I got worried
You cant do that you'll go to jail
Then I started taxing her and she started accusing me of not being her daughter cause I don't sound like her
What. Apparently you don't know your daughter very well then is exactly what I said then it got heated I started to text yell at her and I explained that my real mother is dead and you are just the lady who birthed me. And she kept saying that I wasn't her daughter and then I said the most terrible thing I've ever said to her I texted so fuck you and she exploded and said my daughter would never say that and I said I just did and then she said video chat me to prove your my daughter and I did but I couldn't say anything I just cried for a minute while she questioned me on who have you been talking to and why would you ever say that to your loving mother.

320,PTSD affecting my relationship and I can't take it anymore,"I feel absolutely terrible. That I'm not a proper girlfriend, that I have too much emotional baggage and generally a hopeless person. 

About 4 to 6 years ago, I was raped by my (abusive) ex. And developed severely warped perception of an actual relationship. In which, to me, sex became payment in exchange for affection. Since I was always treated well as long as I had sex with him regularly. After being forced to break up with him, I ended up in other abusive relationships. I thought it was ok. That it was normal to exchange sex for affection and dates. And that if I didn't comply I deserved to be hit, yelled at or ignored. 

Whatever I went through with my exes hurt. It hurt so much I developed a serious case of depression that I tried to commit suicide (unsuccessfully) multiple times. 

Fast forward to 2018, I met this incredibly sweet guy. He was proper. He changed my perception of a relationship. He treats me well. He never laid hands on me. He taught me how to defend myself and that it was ok to refuse sexual advancements. He is supportive and reliable through my depression and never complained.  And the best part, he gave me all the attention I ever need. So much, that he would drop everything he could just to be by my side. 

But of course, not everyone is perfect. He has his own issues. Causing him to think that sex is affirmation and love; complete opposite of what I think it is. And due to my fear of being treated like a (sex) toy, I was adamant on developing our relationship (mainly) emotionally. I didn't want sex to play a big part in our relationship. I didn't want to be ""loved"" for only my body.  

I can't ease his sexual needs. His need for physical connection in which he says it helps him feel closer to me and loved. I try my best but it still isn't enough. He gets upset that I'm not sexually attracted to him and he would bring it up when he's feeling really stressed out. But I'm just not sexually attracted.. I love him for the way he acts and not his body. I have close to no desire to make a move on him like he wants. All I want to do is be by his side and have meaningful conversations rather than have sex. So much, that he ends up initiating it 98% of the time. 

The problem, everytime he brings up this situation, it triggers me. I end up becoming extremely afraid that he'll use me like my exes. It always makes me think that I owe him sex and my payment for affection is overdue. And I end up being so shaken up due to the amount of horrible flashbacks I get from being triggered, I end up accusing him of being just like them when he's truly not. It tears me apart everytime this happens. I end up crying, shaking, afraid and suicidal. I can't handle it... What should I do?  He says I'm the only one for him and I do think the same of him too. It's just that sometimes I feel that he'd be better off with someone that has lesser baggage that is able to tend to his needs.

328,I don't know how to get help,"I've dug myself into a really bad situation here. This is gonna be long, but ill have a tl;dr at the bottom.

    For the past 4 months or so I've resorted to self harm to cope with whats happening to me. I went through serious emotional trauma through my entire life, from childhood to teen years to now, and I just have gotten so busy recently, and so tired, i felt there was no other way to release that tension. I don't want to be too detailed, but ive cut myself, bitten myself, punched my arm in an attempt to break or fracture it, and subjected myself to a lot of emotional self harm such as seeking out past abusers, and triggering dissasociation with images that scare me.

    However, the problem comes in because its a complete and total secret. Nobody in my family knows. None of my friends know. My own boyfriend doesnt know what I've been doing to myself just to get through the rough spots. I've been over working myself and hoping that it'll force me not to think about it but it got worse, and so now, nobody thinks anything is wrong when it couldnt be worse. None of them are going to take me seriously. I'm constantlt doing things, and I'm always attentive, and responsive, because I'm so scared to death of letting anyone find out that the moment someone points out any imperfection or slugishness, I overcorrect and force myself to prove im ok. Its been pushing people away. And people seriously believe im totally ok. I feel like if I don't get myself help soon I'm going to crack. Just an hour ago I had a severe anxiety attack and just started hurting myself, just, out of nowhere. I can't keep doing this. It's becoming addiction. I think about it now, intrusivley. I thought I could do it just once and get away with it. I'm wrong. I don't know why I thought I was an exception, I just wanted a way out.

    I just hate myself. I hate my life and I hate my family. I want a therapist. I want a doctor. I want medication. Anything. My parents have told me im over reacting. Im so worried that soon im going to do something to myself, just to force them to do something about it. But i cant end up in a psych ward. I cant. It sounds so stupid, but they'll take out my nose ring. It was a birthday gift. Its the only thing I really, genuinley like about my appearance. If they take it out itll make me want to scratch my face up and pick my hair out. I know it will. I cant go to a psych ward, i just cant do it, i dont have the time for it, and it would make me anxious, and scared, and angry. I just want to talk to a counselor.

But thats not an option; nothing is. My parents dont believe me, my counselor said she ""couldnt do anything about it if my abuser didnt hit me physically"", my doctor noted it but didnt act on it because i told him im not self harming because i didnt want to end up in a psych ward, i checked my insurance and it only covers costs for pregnant and drug addicted people and my friends would land me in a psych ward!! I cant afford online therapy, and even then, it requires a parent sign off and they wouldnt let me, never ever ever. I dont know what i can do. I dont think i can help myself out of this one.

Tlldr: my mental health has been plummeting and ive resorted to really bad coping mechanisms. I need help but every source ive gone to has told me im overreacting, they cant help, or they want to send me to a psych ward, which would be my absolute worst nightmare. Is there anything i can do?",1568612254.0
329,"I don’t know how to cope with this, I’ve considered drugs, but I just can’t","(17M) As a kid I’ve been through a lot, I was introduced to this world by two drug addicts and my dad left me at the age of three, also went to foster care because my mom was an heavy alcoholic and drug user, I’ve been to two foster homes because the first one didn’t bathe me and my sister for a year, (and other horrendous things, like locking me in a dog cage and rolling me down a hill, I was 4) my mom got out of jail and got us back by the age of five/six, I haven’t seen my dad since, and my mom used to beat us, but stopped a few years ago, due to “Jesus” 
(she still yells, threatens and has to take heavy medication)

Everything is alright and my mom apologized and said she cries herself to sleep a lot because of what she did to us. It’s hard to forgive her for what she did to me and my sister, whenever I look at her I remember crying in my room, alone in the dark and thinking she killed my sister, I heard my sister yell “Call 911”, but I couldn’t because I was young, had no phone, and was too scared to do anything. After my sister yells all I heard was her gasping for air, which eventually died out, and  heard nothing except my mom grunting. This happened maybe 3 years ago and I try not to think about it but it’s hard not to. She’s made me bleed and bruised me multiple times, it’s hard to get over it, I doubt I ever will. There were countless night like this. 

I’ve had depression on and off since the age of fourteen, and recently took on anxiety. The depression affects my life and I’m tired of it, I’ve given up on things like school and so many jobs because of it, or I randomly lose motivation and I don’t know why. 

 My sister (19) has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and add, she used to cope with it by taking hard drugs and alcohol, I’m very mild mannered and have never done drugs or alcohol despite my friends and family doing them and pressuring me to do so, I’m scared I’ll turn out like my mom and beat my kids, I haven’t had any violent outbreaks though and I think I’m normal in that sense but I don’t know what to do, I’m fine at the moment but I’m afraid that I’ll quit out on school again because of the chronic depression or something.

Also, my sisters dad is still in her life and talks to her regularly, my dad doesn’t even send me Christmas wishes or acknowledges my birthday, his now-wife asked me to move in with them a while back and I think it had nothing to do with that douchebag father of mine, I envy children that play with their amazing dads and it affects me a lot. Even when passing happy families in the mall, etc I feel all this and I hate it, I wish it could all go away.

I feel extremely alone in all of this, my entire family besides me and my sister has had good parents, and a great childhood, my friends and everyone I know have amazing parents and grew up normally, even my sister has a good dad in her life but mine doesn’t even acknowledge that I’m alive, I’ve tried reaching out to him before and he doesn’t seem interested in talking to me, I wish someone could understand the stuff I’m going through and give me advice on bettering myself.

I love my mom but I can’t help but feel hatred for her, although its mostly died out, I don’t know if it’s justified or not. Hating your mother is never a good thing, but after over a decade of watching my mom beat my sister and me, it’s hard to forget that. I used to hate my mother so much, whenever I thought of her I wanted to make her feel the pain she’s made us feel. Im trying to make peace with my past but it’s hard to. Idk how I haven’t off’d myself yet, I’ve tried but it’s hard to.

330,My Mental illnesses are making me suicidal but I’m keeping it hidden from my loved ones,"Let me just start off by saying I’m 12 years old and I have an abnormal amount of mental illnesses, the only ones I self diagnose are the ones that made sense reading through the symptoms list, this is making me feel suicidal but my anxiety, depression and general self loathing are keeping me from calling the suicide hotline for fear of being embarrassed or ashamed of my actions afterwards. I don’t know why I find Reddit to be a better alternative but it just feels more familiar. I would use a throwaway but I don’t think my friends care enough to read my posts. Anyway my two main reasons for my suicidal thoughts are being in the closet not just with my bisexuality but because of my sadistic tendencies and other personality disorders. Furthermore my anxiety (GAD) is blowing things out of proportion and making me think that my friends will hate me because of it. I know it sounds dumb but whenever I try to come out about these things I just tense up. In fact the last time I tried to come out I nearly had a panic Attack, I think this is partially because the first friend I came out to was anti-gay and didn’t really care about my mental illnesses, he wasn’t not supportive he just didn’t give two fucks. Secondly I wanna die because I’m having multiple existential crises a week just thinking about how I’m still in junior high and things are already this fucking bad and also about how’d the adult world is a scary place that I’ll probably never even get to see at this rate. I know for a fact that if I tell someone it will get better but I already told the person I trust most and they just made things worse. I’m just a kid and this is really fucking scary and the scariest part right now is how I see my old friends look back at the cuts on their wrists and laugh about how it really wasn’t that bad back then. Stuff like that is what scares me the most because that implies that it gets worse and the one thing that I’ve been repeating to myself to get me through this is “it gets better” but I’m starting to think that’s not true. if there’s any advice you have for this type of shit then please by all means tell me but at this point just having someone to talk to about all of this would be nice if you have any questions feel free to ask them because none of them will offend me

331,a cry for help,"im in need of help. not financially but mentally. lately ive been worried about drama at school in which involves some of my 'friends.' 

characters;
ff#1 (fake friend number 1)
ff#2 (fake friend number 2)
rf (real friend)

two of these friends have been putting me down. i trusted both of them so much- no, too much. one of them has gossiped about me behind my back to my other friends, in which they told me that this person was talking bad about me. the thing about this though is that that person who we'll call ff as fake friend knows that im sensitive. 

ff had called me fake. yes, because i was apparently ignoring her. now this hurt. knowing that someone i trusted called me fake really felt like a stab in the back. ff would tell my other friend, rf (real friend) that i was ""doing it again"" (being fake or ignoring her) or just say very rude and vulgar things about me.

anyways, fast forward to the end of the school year and yeah. i found out that ff was saying rude stuff about me to 3 other people. fun. i confronted ff and asked them why. their exact words were ""i dont recall."" now, that hurt. i told them that i had evidence stacked up against them including text messages. i showed them. they immediately blocked me and then unblocked me. we stopped talking for awhile. 

suddenly, in mid august this girl at my school posts something on her instagram story which works like;

-i'll send you a category and you have to give me a name of someone who it fits.
-for an example, if the category is richest student you would put so and so's name 
-you would then choose for me to show or cover your answer on my story.

now, this girl is my friend. i reply to her story. she puts, ""fakest friend?"" i put ff's name. pretty hypocritical for me. ff sees this. ff knows im insecure and had suicidal tendencies before. ff replies to this girls story and she says ""ugliest in the grade."" ff replies with my name.

this hurt. a lot. i eventually overcame the situation with the help of a friend... not a rf though.

this friend named ff#2 (fake friend number two) was someone who had helped me overcome my problems and actually supported me. my rf told me that ff#2 was talking about me. instead of calling me fake, she accused me of bragging about the cuts on my arm that she knew i wasnt proud of. 

i was heartbroken. i texted the girl i thought was truly a good person. i said ""thank you for all the smiles, but why did you give me false hope?"" she read the message and replied immediately. i left her on read when i had a mental breakdown. she then called me and told me that she only said it to agree with ff#1. 

NOW THIS MADE ME PISSED. she told more than one person. but she apologized and said that she would never betray me.

I have to get death certificates, I have to make money for the cremation, I have to do this, I have to do that, I can't do any of it because if I pay any of these people I'm not going to be able to pay rent, my grandmother is acting like I'm just not trying hard enough, she actually said ""You can't just expect a job to appear out of thin air"" like I'm not working myself to the bone to find a job. 

I can't even mourn my mother, I haven't even been able to sit down and really come to terms with it, she's gone, and I can't even have a service for her.  I know cremation is cheaper, but it's still out of our price range entirely and now the funeral home we had intended on going with before we realized how expensive they were (this is my grandmother's fault, she's the one who called them), now they are getting impatient and angry that we haven't done anything.

I can't get funds for the poor people funeral funds that the state provides for people who can't pay for funerals because they refuse to believe I don't have money, ""How are you paying your bills?"" they ask, I pay the bills/rent VERY closely every month because I get odd jobs and do them and get money for them, but it's not enough, and the county doesn't believe me so they won't give me the money, my mother had no life insurance and left nothing behind to us in the case of her death. 

It's getting scary, I'm afraid I won't be able to do any of this, I was already hospitalized once because of the stress of all of this, and it's becoming impossible not to break down entirely, what can I do? People just keep suggesting the same things over and over again and not listening to me when I say I can't afford any of it.

340,"As a person who has struggled with anger their whole life, allow me to impart some advice that helped me.. (x-post /r/anger)","Hey guys,

So a bit about me.. I'm a 31 year old Australian guy who was bullied a lot through school, developed some social issues as a result of that bullying and have been working on anger my whole life.

I was the type of person who would resort to anger in the first instance. I was sought after at school because kids knew that if they started me, I'd fight them and so they'd come to pick fights on purpose.

My childhood home was riddled with holes, broken doors, holes in plastic outdoor furniture, etc. I would snap, break things, lose my temper pretty bad.
After a while (early 20's) it started to dawn upon me that the way I was handling myself (or failing to handle myself) was causing me major strife in my life. I struggled to keep friends, I lost a couple of jobs due to angry episodes, and driving? Driving was one of the worst. I was a horrible driver due to overreacting to almost every simple thing that happened to me.

So one day a few years ago I heard someone giving advice to someone else over their anger issues and somehow it just clicked. All of a sudden, at the drop of a hat, perspective was achieved and believe it or not, it's changed my life. I'm still on the angry side of neutral but it's mild, easy to control, and not as common as it used to be.

The advice was this:

Anger is like a tennis ball. If someone throws the tennis ball at you, and you catch it, that anger is now yours. If you're driving and someone cuts you off out of impatience or apathy, they've tossed a tennis ball at you and if you choose to catch it, it's your anger.

If you let it come at you and just fall to the ground, and you choose not to pick up the tennis ball, it's THEIR anger.

So, I've taken to repeating in my head.. Don't catch the tennis ball.",1413108338.0

If she asks me to do something and I don’t do it she will either emotionally manipulate me with suicide threats, or physically hit me. If any of us defend ourselves she says we are all “evil” and all hate her and treat her differently. 

When I try to figure out why she is like this, she says it’s because my mom shouted at her all the time as a child. My mom has shouted at all of us and I understand why she is upset about that, but causing her younger siblings trauma and terrorising my mom no matter what she does is not going to fix it. It’s like she sees NO wrong in her actions but can only see the wrong in other peoples actions. My mom and her have gotten into physical fights which are always instigated by her. My mom has bruises on her arms and head. I wouldn’t even call it a fight it’s more my sister abusing my mom whilst she tries to defend herself.  

I used to get involved but it made things 1000x worse, with me getting hit too and usually some emotional manipulation which caused me to have panic attacks because I felt so stuck, it would also make her more angry so she would hurt my mom more. My little siblings are also terrified of what she might do. All of us comply with her and spend time with her because she is obsessed with “family” (even though she abuses us). If we don’t comply with her she will terrorise us even more.

I’m stuck on what to do. We cant legally kick her out because she’s under 18, and if we tried I doubt she would listen. If we get the police involved they will be more inclined to believe her because she is under 18 and God knows what she could come up with. Does anybody have any ideas? Or just something that can help me cope a bit more? Because it’s really destroying my mental health.

345,I have the right to know about my own body,"TW: child abuse

So something happened to me when I was a child. I have no idea what, but I know it wasn't good. The child therapist told my family to never mention it and I'd forget. But I didn't. I've thought about it often since then. However, when I ask my parents about what happened, they refuse to tell me. My mom will lie to protect me, it makes my dad too angry and sick to talk about. I've been trying to get my life back on track after some recent tragedies, but I have to be able to accept my past to move on from it. How do I accept it when I don't know what happened to my own body? I only know the abusers first name and the general location of where it happened. Nothing else. Is it possible to find the information myself or is it hopeless to try?",1660200304.0
346,advice/help needed! - i’m terrified that i (18m) will fail to be a supportive friend to my best friend (18f) who is a SA survivor…,"pre-note: hoping to get advice from women and/or sa survivors… 


2 months ago, my (18m) friend (18f) was sexually assaulted (multiple times).


One of my best friends, someone who i would do almost anything for to protect, someone who almost feels like a sister to me - traumatised, humiliated and defiled by some asshole who had no right going anywhere near her. 


(backstory):

We only became close friends last year (despite having gone to school with her for the last 6 years), and since then, she has become my rock, and i hope that i have become the same for her.

She helped me through many mental health issues last year, and I honestly don’t trust any of my other friends more than her. 

However, at the start of this year she moved cities to study at university, so we kind of lost touch with each other (i.e. we didn’t talk at all since december until about a month ago), but I still consider her one of my closest friends i’ve ever had, and one of the most important people in my life. 

She first texted me a month ago to thank me for donating money for her mum, who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer - we talked, I asked how her mum was and how she was feeling about her mum. I then asked how she was going with everything else - this is when she told me what happened to her…


When she told me, I literally began shaking, as I - understandably - became terrified about her safety (physically, mentally and emotionally).

I know as her friend i cannot be the saviour of this whole situation, but I am also terrified that I will say something that will cause triggers, upset her, etc.

Aside from my constant reassurance that “I am here for you as your friend if you ever need or want to talk about it”, I am at a loss for how to help her - **I should note here that she is already going to a therapist** -, having never known anyone personally who is a SA survivor.

So, I turned to the internet for advice, and compiled a list of tips and advice (on how to support SA survivors) that I found:

***Note: I know that some of these are just common sense and I obviously already knew a few of them.


(list of tips):

- LISTEN (don’t make it about myself) - let her say what she needs/wants to say in her own words and at her own pace.

- reassure her that you believe everything she says

- reassure her that she is still the same person she was before anything happened - surviving and coping with traumatic events like this will make her stronger than she already is.

- help her to realise that she is safe now and the worst of it is over - remind her to think of where she is, the day and the time (i.e help her to focus on the present).

- if she feels guilty (e.g. for not fighting the asshole back) - affirm the fact that she used her survival instincts to stay alive and minimise further harm. also help her realise that compliance is not consent.

- don’t pressure her to talk about anything if she is uncomfortable with it (obviously)


…

considering this list, **I would really appreciate:

- feedback on whether or not these tips/advice is appropriate or effective in helping to support SA survivors?

- advice (perhaps from personal experience) that may help me to be a more supportive friend.**


…

I should also note that she is coming back to my city to visit friends and family in a few weeks, and we have agreed to meet up.

Considering that I haven’t seen her in 6 months, I want our upcoming (and limited) time together to just be a fun time where two friends are simply catching up.

But I also want to use this catch up as an opportunity - considering I probably wont see her for a long time after this - to talk with her about her experience (if she is comfortable/wanting to talk about it), and offer her support as a friend in person (rather than just over infrequent text messages) 

*My concern with this is trying to find the right balance between having a fun time (which will hopefully help her to take her mind off of the issue) and offering support as a friend (without making it seem like some sort of therapy session).*

Again, advice is appreciated :)

Thank you so much for reading and hopefully commenting on this (rather-lengthy) post.

349,I lost my mom today,"I’m 17, and I’ve always been close to my mom. She did not die, but I felt as I lost her. She’s been married to her husband bud. Bud was nice before she married him, now he’s abusive and manipulative. In the past he had tried to drive us off a bridge because he lost his phone. My mom was driving and he pulled on the wheel, when we stopped I called my dad and he said call the cops. Bud ran away and I tried to get a restraining order but because we were out of state it couldn’t happen. I was 13. During the whole court trial my moms side of the family were upset and telling me I was selfish and to just ignore it. Bud threatens to divorce my mom and told me she will be homeless and it will all be my fault. After the court I wouldn’t stay at my moms so my mom promised that he wouldn’t be near and he would go to a hotel on the weeks my brother and I were there, but instead she brought us to a hotel, got wasted and bud came and stayed the night at the hotel, drinking and yelling at my brother and I. 

Throughout the years bud has been saying that he will divorce my mom anytime something goes wrong, he yells at me and my brother, threatening me and telling me to kill myself. He’s even threatened to kill my bird. Hit my mother on Christmas Eve because he was drunk and said that my brother, sister and I were ungrateful, My sister woke me up crying and the cops were there. I’ve been dealing with it because I love my mother.

 About a week ago I was looking for my bird and my mom was helping, he got out of his cage and I was scared something happened to him. My mom yelled for me because she found it and that angered bud and he started to scream I’m no longer welcome at the house and he’s going to kill my bird. I yell back in defense that I’ve done nothing wrong and he proceeds to charge at me with a knife. My bf was in my room and I yelled for him, running. When I got into my room I grabbed my tazer and he asked what was happening. I ran back to get my bird and he sees me and charges at me again saying he’s going to kill my bird, so I go run to the porch where my mom was with my bird to get him. My mom holds him back by the shirt and I am against a wall telling him if he touches me I will taze him. He yells if I taze him he will call the cops and I will be arrested. My bf then grabs on to bud aswell and he is finally pulled away enough for me to go to my room. I pack my stuff and my bf brings me and my bird to his house for the night. 

Things have cooled off but I get the news that my mom is moving and I can’t bring my bird with me. So I asked my dad if I can bring my bird to his place and he says no and he told me that the bird was too much. 

Today I just broke down. I texted my mom everything that was bothering me ranting about my dad being unfair and bud being a dick. Apparently bud saw those messages and texted me I have to leave or he will call the cops on me. My brother drives me to my moms and I pack everything up, having to leave my bird because my mom said she will care for him till the 22 of this month. She then says that she hoped I would just get along with him. That’s when I loose all faith in my mother. She allowed me to go through so much abuse, nights to where I locked the door and held a bat until he fell asleep. Where he threatens me and my bird. Where he is constantly telling me that I’m nothing and she would chose him over me, and he’s right. She did. 
And now I don’t feel anything but sadness and regret. I don’t want to try anymore and I just want to stay in my room and sleep it all away.",1649052807.0
350,"23 years old, been in a really dark place, now trying to win over myself and be a better person","Hi everyone, this is the first time for me writing something on reddit, so I hope it will not be a problem writing such a long post. Basically my last months were really really difficult ones. In particular, I had a relationship which really broken me, or at least, I don't know if it broken me or it made me realize how much I was already broken before meeting her. Basically sometimes I had suicide thoughts because of the overall situation and I went to therapy 4/5 times, then stopped it because I was feeling like ""I didn't have much more to say"" and I was perceiving time spent doing that as something not so practical / affecting me. Furthermore, I dated 3/4 girls after her (thanks to dating apps), of which I even kissed one and brought her to my home, after that moment we basically ghosted each other (I didn't write her and she didn't write me). I would say that if someone would judge my life from an outside perspective it's something that looks really good: I am a good student in a top university, I have a family which loves me and financially supports me, I have few friends, but with whom I feel like myself and I can talk about anything. Despite that, considering more the part of my life I can see and judge more than others, there are some things with whom I really struggle on a daily basis.

**Two minors issues**

* **First of all, I don't like my body and I would like to lose weight** \--> This is something I am working on in the last weeks, indeed, I went to gym on a daily basis, now these days I am sick so I cannot go there, but I trust myself and I think I will be able of losing weight and be in a good shape. My biggest concern here is that after reaching a good point and having reached a good body then I would start not following anymore this habbit and become bad again (it happened when I was 17 years old, I had abs after 3 months of gym on a daily basis, then school started and I didn't went to gym anymore for years).
* **Cutting alcohol from my life** \--> Many times it happened that I took decisions in my life due to alcohol or I treated others badly due to being drunk, I am trying to drink less. I have already drinked less than usual these 2 months (I had 4/5 beers overall, due to social circumstances, like spending time with others who I know would have liked me to drink in that moment)

**My two biggest issues**

* **Dealing with porn / masturbation / NoFap** \--> For years, and I mean **years** (since I was 15) I used porn and masturbation as a way to escape from my problems, I used to masturbate to porn 3/4 times a day and I know for sure this is something I have done in the moments in which I was feeling worse. For example, if someone didn't message me back or if I was anxious for a girl I would haved masturbated a lot. Also, after losing to videogames masturbation was an habit. Now I am trying to go to a nofap journey, I had a 5 days streak, yesterday I fapped so here I go starting again. For me it's really really really difficult to quit porn and masturbation, especially because it seems a life-changing decision, and so I start thinking ""ok now I will start this, so does it means that I will no longer fap to porn / masturbation in my life?"" and the thought really really scares me.
* **Dating** \--> In the last months I have been subscripted to tinder and bumble, I feel like I was able of finding girls to talk with and I had few dates. On the other hand, there are 3 issues in this matter. The first is that dating itself is something exhausting, it's exhausting because it feels like you have to impress others. The second one is that I am currently studying abroad, in June I will go back to my parents country and in August I will start an exchange semester. So I perceive this thing of changing countries many times could be something detrimental for having a relationship. Third and last one, I had 9 relationships in my life, all of them lasted maximum 2 months, I am really scared that having another relationship would lead to the same outcome, I really don't want that and now, more than ever, I need a lot of stability in my life. Many times I think ""Should I stop dating for few months and just focus on myself?"" but I am really scared of being lonely or not having someone so close to me during some months of my life (I think that more or less in my life I always had periods in which I had either a relationship or a crush for someone, I think love is one of the most important things in life).

**I really don't know if there exist one solution or a reply to every of these problems, I would appreciate also having an answer just to one of them, if you have ever been through something similar or if you have advices to share. Thanks a lot to this community, wish everyone a nice self-improvement journey!**",1645102603.0

352,Spending my birthday alone… again.,"
Ok so I’d like to point out for the sake of context I have a pretty impressive track record of friends ditching me and/or being generally shitty, and the people mentioned in this post know this.

so, J and A are my closest friends, however I was feeling cast aside because J hardly interacts with me nowadays since he ditched me on Halloween, which is(?) a resolved problem. However, there’s this running bit that J and A have that they are fucking and would offer me to join them but only rarely (this is relevant).

Internally, I was thinking to myself that I have no right to feel like this, they’re having a good time right? I should cope with my own shit instead of making them deal with it?

So the bit kept going for a few months and at this point I was like there’s no way they’re not at least dating; and guess what? they were. And they weren’t planning to tell me. And they were acting like ‘tee hee, OP can’t connect the dots,’ last time I checked this wasn’t fucking middle school?? This effectively put me in a 3rd wheel position; getting abandoned again. And they had the audacity to joke about fucking me when they really couldn’t give 2 shits about how I feel. 

I’ve had fleshed out plans for my birthday, but I left the planning GC, along with every other chat I shared with them. I told A not to bother, and I ignored J. I really don’t want to spend my birthday alone for the 3rd time, but I think that I’ll have to. Am I expecting to much from J and A? Am I being selfish?

So, TL;DR: friends decided it was a good idea to date; essentially pushing me away, I cancel birthday plans. what things can I do to have an O-K birthday?",1639966727.0

I don’t want to be dramatic by asking this but I can’t get this question out of my head. Is spanking a kid considered to be child abuse?

I’m working through some things I went through in my childhood and the topic of spanking came up. I grew up thinking it was normal (although it never happened to me too many times). The times it did happen to me, my pants would be pulled down so my bare bottom was exposed and then spanked a few times (no bruises though). 

I remember feeling embarrassed about such a private part of my body being shown and for it being touched (and by touched I mean spanked. Nothing sexual). I also remember feeling very angry after the fact, and then never repeating the thing I got spanked for (only because I didn’t want to risk getting spanked again). I also remember my parents saying that it hurt them more than it hurt me, which thinking back to that makes me so angry. What do you mean it hurt you more?? I’m the one who’s bare bottom just got spanked!

(Also just so it’s clear, it was only ever my parents who spanked me, never anyone else)

359,Breakup,"
Hi. Me and my gf just broke up. Because of intimacy issues and lack of feelings from her part. I haven’t felt loved for months now but we’ve both been very scared to break it up.
I’m extremely sad right now, and one thing that I really can’t get over is the thought of being replaced one day. My thoughts are based a lot on sex. Not so much about me as a person. 

I can’t stop thinking about the fact that she might find much more sexual satisfaction with someone else in the future. That she never liked our sex life or how I wasn’t really good enough for her.
I guess this stems from the fact that I’ve become so insecure and fixated over my sexuality in the past months when stuff haven’t been so good between us. And that’s why I can’t handle this now. 
I just don’t know how to get over this and I hate that this is one of my biggest concerns right know.

When we were breaking up I kept thinking about how much I craved that affection and love one last time. I really wanted us to have sex and if we would, I would handle this better and move on.
I feel a bit disgusting for thinking like this. I’m just so insecure about this part of me and I’ve felt touch-starved for so long now.

It would make more sense , if she was the one thinking about how she couldn’t satisfy me like that. and that I might find someone who I’m more compatible with in that way. But I know she is not thinking like that. I don’t even know what she feels. Probably a relief. And that’s okay. But I’m so very hurt",1619872127.0

362,How to cope with my spouse going to a mental illness treatment center.,"So my spouse had been in therapy for depression and anxiety for a while once every few weeks or every week and takes medication.  They've also been hurting themself and having intrusive thoughts.  This led to their therapist suggesting a residential treatment center.  Well the therapist reached out on Thursday/Early Friday and the treatment center reached out to my spouse on Friday for an assessment and accepted them.  Then they expected them to be there Saturday (today) by noon.  The center is 5 hours away so they had to leave early.  I feel like I'm still processing things since everything happened so fast.  Now I'm trying to cope with the fact they'll be gone and I need to live without them here for however long but there are just so many unknowns.


For those that have been in situations like this and have sought or known someone that has sought help in an inpatient treatment center.

How long does treatment usually last?

I'd like to visit them on weekends.  What's the situation around visitors?

They can't have their phone.  Is there any type of freedom at all?

The initial admission process is really scary.  After how long do things begin feeling ""normal""?

I don't know what to do with my time now.  We spend all weekend hanging out and today has just been so hard without them...  The house is quiet and I'm at a loss for what to do.  I'll distract myself by watching a movie or playing a game but when I'm done I just fall back to being sad and wanting to cry...  How can I fill my empty time gaps and not feel so sad?

Sometimes he said we should go play in the basement, we used to hang up posters there. I said yes, sure. I can tell by the posters that what happened next was in 2006, so I was 5 years old and he was 10 or 11.

He said we should play this game he thought of called ""present hiding"", and the next few details get fuzzy, but he told me to take off my clothes, to lay on the floor and then he got on top of me and told me to close my eyes and to take him into my mouth. He told me it was a rolled up slice of pizza, but secretely looked and saw it was flesh.

I don' remember what happened next but i refused and he told me to never tell anybody that happened. And i never did, just put my clothes back on and went back upstairs. Nothing ever happened I think, but somehow I still think about it again and again, how powerless i was, i think it fucked me up a great deal and that my self esteem issues are (partially?) rooted in that incident.

Was that sexual assault? We were both children. Nothing ever happened. Would it be insulting to rape victims if i saw that as sexual assault? I can' stop thinking about it, even over a decade later. I'll never tell anybody about it but i need to know how to feel about it.",1609360163.0
365,Girl I love parents said I’ll never be able to see her again," So I am a great kid I do good in school and am very respectful cut to the chase, me and my bestfriend got alc for the girls we like because they wanted it, but we planned to have a night were we would all hang out and watch movies or something. We got there and they decided it would be better to drink at a park at a school, so we all go there and start drinking, we had Smirnoff, after that we all started talking and we were each hanging with our crushes, literally getting along and having conversations for once, which was planned to be a great night, that was when my crush started acting woozy and said she was sorry for everything she had done(my ex), she then said she loved me a couple times, and that I was really nice, and we were cuddling, and then all of a sudden the lower half of her body went numb and I promised her I would keep her safe, because she means a lot to me, so I started helping her get across the park to her friends house, while my friend helped his crush get to the house they were staying over, all of a sudden she passed out and it broke me, I started to carry her the. My arms gave out and slammed on the floor, but I let my arms take the impact not her, I then started to drag her a bit home cause she had to be home at that moment, right before I get her to the curb the staff at the school saw and questioned what happened, I was scared and promised I’d keep her safe no matter what and said I found her like that... then the cops came and questioned me and smelt the alcohol on my breath, so I then confessed every little detail, while I was talking to them, just seeing my crush get put on the ambulance really messed me up, it literally shattered my heart knowing I could have had her harmed from the alc, the cops then told us to call our parents and give them their info, after that my crushes friends mom said me and my friend would never be able to come to their house again, those words have been ringing in my head everyday, I told her I was really sorry but she said I wasn’t, trust me when I say this I really regret everything I did, I just wanted my crush and her friend to be happy, now I know there is 100% better ways to do that, and I’m not drinking for a long long time not till I’m way way older, the next day I texted her friend and her and they were both alright thankfully, I said I was sorry for everything that happened that night, then I asked if she remembered when she said she said I love you, and she was sorry for everything, and I was nice, and she just replied with I don’t remember saying that, oop. That kinda made me really sad and I don’t know why :(, thank god I was there though because if it was someone else that was with them they could have been left there and they probably could have died, I’m just really glad she’s okay, but very sad that I can’t see her, is there any thing I could do to see her again?",1606641712.0

368,Free and easy to use mental health resources I’ve found useful,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",1604514249.0

370,I need help,"It has been just over around 4 weeks since I reached out to my “friends”, and I am slowly going into a deep depression.

I have always been the one to reach out to my friends, make plans, ask them how they’re are doing.... even give them weeks of space when  I sensed they may need it. All for which I started to notice I never got nothing in return back.

This led me to start questioning myself. I’ve known these people for the longest and I have never had a problem with them.

It came to a point where I decided to not reach out to them. I was ok about it, but then I started to view everyone as the same only to find me 4 weeks later not having reached out to anyone in 4 weeks.

This has severely impacted my ability to make friends, my confidence and has made me sound more needy when I’m around people. It is also making me not like making friends as I think that the same thing will happen as with my group of friends. This didn’t happen once and I suddenly gave up on them but for the last 2years until I finally had enough. When it started 2years ago I specifically told them what was wrong they agreed with me but quickly picked up the habit again.

Ps. Today was my last day of high school and specifically noticed not having talked to anyone in weeks, my tone was needy and no one seem to give a shit about me.

371,My weird time phobia,"Sorry if I'm not in the right place but I couldn't think of anywhere else to find my problem because whenever I look it up I just get suicide hotlines n stuff. (also sorry if wrong flair)

For a while now, I've had a weird phobia about time. Not that I'm scared to die, not that I hate my past, I just really hate thinking about a time before the present and the things people miss out on when they're born at a certain time. I feel weird about any year before late 2019 and get sad (almost like greif) when I think of the age people are now when they're born any time before 2002.

This ""phobia"" can also ruin my experience of certain things like shows and movies; if I hear that (for example) it was made in the 90s, that's all I can think about. It's so annoying, so frustrating and I have no idea how to stop it.

I don't know why I feel this way. I'm also not against people born before 2002, it's just makes me feel weird thinking about it. I'm 14 (born 2006) if that is any reference.

Thanks

372,I've been manipulated to the point where I can't live peacefully,"(trigger warming I guess) I usually don't post things like this on Reddit because I'm scared people will attack me so sorry if I'm a bit awkward. For context I had this friend for about 2 and a half years. I can't go into too much detail without panicking but in a nutshell they did things that hurt me, most my friends irl, and family. It wasn't really physical mostly verbal. Like I said I struggle to go into detail about it so I'm sorry if I can't explain it well. But they were really hurtful. It got to the point where I would panic or break down if I wasn't perfect for them because of the things they did or made me feel bad. I can't talk about certain events that lead up to this but I remember when I was 13 in 2018 I started self harming for two reasons. 1) because i was terrified of them/ me not being good enough and as a general coping method which I still use today. It's really hard explain without much context but I've considered commiting suicide before. I've never attempted it but it's on my mind a lot as a way to get out. It has been I'd say since I was 12 or 13 when I've thought about ending my life? (I'm 15 now) the friendship ended a few months ago. They told me they were sick of me lying and ditching them also I made their issues worse ext... Before this happened I sometimes went into panic if they contacted me or if I saw something related to them but ever since we cut each other off I've felt worse. I go into a shock state or panic almost daily. Sometimes it can last over a day some about half an hour. I have to go back to school for one more year where they will be. I also have to be stuck in a really small classroom near them for about two hours as soon as I go back. I already go into enough shock when they aren't around to the point when even if I hear a knock I'd think they are coming to harm me. Idk how I'm going to survive when I'm stuck with them. I've thought about doing something like poisoning myself so I can be really sick but I don't know if it will work so I have no way out. I do have a therapist who knows about this but we haven't talked long and so far they have only told me to think positive. I haven't gone into much detail (like with self harm and stuff) with my parents but they know I panic about it and have being hurt by this person as well. But they also tell me to think positive. I've tried it so many times but honestly it really doesn't work for me. As well as coping methods dealing with self harm. And when I say I've tried I mean it. But nothing helps and I either just feel numb or scared mainly. I used to think that this person wasn't the only thing that caused this but honestly, as much as I hate to admit it, I think they mainly did it. I understand that people want to force me to be around them to help me recover (and also because everyone says education is more important than mental health) but it's going to make everything worse. I've tried saying that but no one listens. And I can't stand it when people tell me to think positive because I've been trying it for so long but it doesn't work. I just want to be happy but I know I won't be able to get help for it. And I'm also scared of people not taking me seriously due to there not being much physical abuse or anything just really bad verbal. I also struggle to tell adults in general because they might just see it as teenage drama or something. I'm not planning on talking to anyone else about it but still. I'm just stuck feeling scared and anxious. I don't really want a future or anything anymore and I'm unable to drop out of move schools away from that person.  Also I don't think my therapist will be able to actually help me properly. Is there anything I can actually do or just to get over this shitty feeling?

374,Podcast on getting help for my depression,"My name is Ashlee and I have had anxiety since I can remember and recently I was diagnosed with depression a month ago.

I have created a podcast called Riding the Wave which is a series that documents my depression (with mentions of anxiety) in real time in hopes it can inspire others in my position to feel less alone in their struggles and later in the series encourage them to seek professional help.

My first episode mentioned my first ever panic attack.

One in five adults will experience depression. As someone who has experienced depression I know that it is important to have these mental health discussions in order for those suffering to know that it is okay and that help is available to them.

If you are in a vulnerable state I **do not** recommend you listening to the podcast (I cry within the first minute and it could be distressing as it is very emotional). 

My latest episode dives into why we find it hard to talk about depression and it features some of my therapy session to give you insight as to what it sounds like.

375,Incest OCD real events are tearing me apart (Im a sick monster),"Hi, im a 16 year old male struggling with OCD, mostly POCD, HOCD and Incest OCD. Before I had just one theme at a time but now im having all 3 at the same time.
I started watching porn like 3-4 years ago and all the trending videos were incest ones, which I watched till today and escalated to me searching for ""real incest videos"", mostly mom and son. It was always a porn thing, thinking about it in real life is disgusting and disturbing. My OCD kicked in, like 3 months ago during the quarantine with the POCD theme, it went away pretty quickly and then HOCD arrived and it made me cry for like a week, it was a scary time and I truly thought I was bi or gay for a moment. When I started accepting the thoughts and doing the ""whatever, maybe I am, maybe im not"" it started getting better, but then, POCD came back again, and it has been the most painful one, it gave me a depression and suicidal thoughts and urges. Incest OCD just appeared out of nowhere when I was stuggling with the HOCD theme and hasn't gone away ever since. My Incest OCD started when a memory came to my mind of something disgusting I've done, and I dont think I'll ever be able to talk to someone about it, but I'll try to write here. I dont really remember all the details, but it was about me taking a pic of my mom's boobs and then fapping to it, but I can't really remember the details and it's all pretty blurry, at this point I dont even know if all this happened, all I remember is me taking a pic. I think it all happened like 1-2 years ago, or maybe 9 months, i dont know... It's so disturbing and I think it will haunt me forever, heck, im not even attracted to my mom, I didn't even remember about this before. Now im also remembering that one time I had a urge to jerk to my mom's panties, but it was just a thought and like that one event, I didn't remember about it till OCD kicked in, and this one might have happened like 1-2 years ago too. Now I keep getting this groinal responses and shit, and sometimes im even afraid to look at my mom, it's all so scary and it's like my brain objectifies her somehow, It's my freaking mom goddamnit !!!!! Heck, I just had a groinal response/semi erection while writing this, wtf help !!!
With all this came all the doubts and thoughts like ""What if im attracted to my mother ?"" and worse ones.
I know im a sick monster and there's no denying it, who the fuck does that shit to their own mother ?
Holy shit, I just remembered another one that happened like 3 months ago, it was me alone with my mom and I had thoughts like ""what if I fuck her ? Maybe if it it's quick, nobody will know"". It's like I was planning it all in my head but I didn't do anything nor I wanted to, but now it's telling me I wanted to and it definitely feels real. Fuck im crying, what kind of sick monster does all this kind of shit ? I know about that oedipus complex shit but it's not the case here because im not attracted to my mother, altough my OCD tells me I am and all those past events just prove it. I dont think there's any kind of way to help me, nobody does this type of shit. 
My only hope is getting castrated, chemically castrated or maybe suicide, I can't live knowing all the disgusting things I've done. One of the weirdest thing here is that when these incest thoughts come up I have urges to watch incest porn and I do, I dont know why. Maybe it is to escape the thoughts or maybe (and most worrisome) because it's like a repressed desire, I heard some people saying it could be that. Actually, all the pedophile, homosexual and incest thoughts feel exactly like that, repressed desires, like im in denial. All the things I did and the thoughts I had before make it seem just like that. Im also having incest dreams now which isn't helping at all.
Why did I do and thought that shit ? Why am I such a depraved and sick motherfucker ? How am I going to talk about this to anyone ? 
I feel like im a time bomb, im trying to hold myself as long as I can but I think it's just a matter of time till I do something stupid, like end my life. When im talking to my friends playing videogames I feel alright, even though HOCD makes me constantly wonder if im attracted or want to fuck them (and the groinal responses, fuck) but the moment im left alone all this hell comes back again.
I saw a teenage psychiatrist 2 weeks ago and he diagnosed me with OCD, im supposed to go for a 2nd session this wednesday but I can't talk to him about this, heck, I dont think I can talk to him about anything, mostly because all my OCD themes have some real events attached to them, which only makes it seem like denial even more.

377,My colleague wrote about a Roman emperor’s philosophy to cope with anxiety,"The article explains **4 different time-tested coping techniques** to turn obstacles into opportunities to **reduce anxiety** and live life more fully and calmly.

I especially like the third technique: *using pain as the driver of progress*. The article explains that pain can harm us only when we wallow in it and allow our emotions to injure us at a much deeper level. By facing the pain and accepting unpleasant emotions instead of fighting them, we can not only reduce stress and anxiety, but we can also thrive with our emotional state.

378,My best mate is treating me like an acquaintance,"I questioning if I just being paranoid or not so I thought would ask Reddit I’m an Australian with dyslexia on a phone( I hate pity, I don’t want to be treated like a sick puppy in need anymore then I have already)
Backstory 

So before the pandemic me and my two best mates would just spend class no more then a table apart talking/doing class work. I have bad anxiety so just knowing they are there and understand what it’s like helps

Come back to school I was so looking forward to see my mates I go to home group (the school basically gave us 90min to just catch up with our classmates because my school didn’t do class video calls) and the started of good I sit next to F1 (friend 1) and F2 (friend 2) sits on the table close by. And we were talking. F2 did all the work like expected and F1 didn’t do any and got away with like expected. But then something weird happens to F2, his whole vibe changes and he starts to drift away from us. Here is were the paranoia and self doubt comes to play, I’m now thinking it’s my fault so my anxiety is playing up, and that makes F1 made at F2 (because not one make his little sister cry) and that lasted for 1.5 weeks. Only after watching me leave art class (F1 isn’t in our art class) crying because of him. He wants to talk to me but nothing more then a hello or good morning but that’s it he still won’t sit with me or F1 and I don’t want to lose him because he doesn’t want me to see him depressed (if the roles were reversed he would bug me till I told him what’s wrong and make me feel better)

380,My childhood trauma,"Hi, I am a 16 year old living in the US. I'm not poor, I'm not in any huge trouble or in any downright abusive relationship but I hope you will listen to my story and help me with what to do with my life. (sorry that this is such a long post, I just sort of ramble on)

So I've been wanting to make this post for a long time. But sometimes never felt justified or felt it was all too serious considering that what my household is like works, for the most part. But the problems have been happening for 9 years as far as I can tell.

My mom is, well off. I don't know any other way to describe it. She has issues. For the past 9 years, she has shown behavior of being really, angry over small things, very petty and narcissistic, and sometimes downright paranoid. An example of her getting angry at something small, is someone like me or my dad (I'll get to him later), is us telling her something she is doing wrong and her getting all defensive and her saying stuff like ""ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THE WAY I TALK, THE WAY I WALK, THE WAY I EAT??"" like we are judging her. I say she is paranoid, because she is always talking about my dad cheating, and how he has ""some slut to visit"" and she will audibly say that. One thing to note about my mom is that, her dad, my grandfather who I've never met, apparently left her family when she was kid. And also my mom is divorced once but she never talks about it, and the first time I heard about it, was when I was 14/15, so over a year ago, from my dad.I'll mention a few small things about her: She has this weird habit of doing things multiple times, like flicking a light switch down multiple times just to turn it off. Or to turn water on and off before turning off finally. I'm usually up really late and sometimes she'll be awake watching tv at like 4am, then fall asleep and wake up at 2 if I don't have to wake her up myself. (This is recently.)

I used to believe that when she said those things, it was just something she was doing recently since I had grown up and I guess she wouldn't care as much cursing around a teen but, I was going through my old videos I used to record for fun as a 7 year old, and she was yelling and cursing all the same. She hasn't changed in years.

So how has she treated me over the years? In my childhood, awful. I remember her always being in her room, not wanting me to bother her while she watched her shows. Which is why I started recording videos with my toys by myself because my mom didn't bother to really care. She always makes the excuse of ""I cook, I clean, I wash clothes"" I am an only child by the way. She would always say she was too tired to go to my boy scouts stuff, or my baseball games, or any school event. And I'd say she came to about 1/10th of any events.

My dad was a military man and he was working for most of the day and got home at 8-9pm. But he always still tried to make time for me. And he'd always be the one to do stuff with me like take me to boy scout meetings, etc.I say was because he ""retired"" but still has to work. From the small amount my parents tell me. My mom had something to do with his early retirement. My parents always play this game of ""tell your son what you did"" like there is some big scandal around everything.

Nothing has really changed about her behavior. I can list more bad times with her than good. One time where I got so fed up with her I argued and said something dumb about jumping out of the car in the middle of the highway just to get away from her, I didn't mean it but some part of me, maybe did. When I had long hair she said I looked like a hobo. And my mom for my entire life always forced me to get this bowl cut to make me look more Asian (my mom is Asian) and like ""her race"". (I'm mixed)Speaking of race, my mom is a huge racist and will call Americans and Mexicans stupid and lazy.I started thanking her for meals she made because I'm at least trying to be a decent person until she brings hatred out of me. And the one day I don't tell her thank you. She gets upset.

She fusses like a little kid. So I found a weight in the garage I wanted to use. I brought it to my room and started using it. My mom who says she's working out, barges into my room asking for it. And I say, why? My mom goes ""I NEED IT"" and grabs it and goes off with it.

She gets defensive and always uses methods to make me angry to make me look like a bad guy. When she is losing an argument that has nothing to do with grades. She will bring up how I'm ""failing"" when half of the time she used that in the past, I wasn't failing and I was getting A's with the lowest being a C.

So what does my dad say to everything? after nearly 16 years of being married to her? He always tells me that we are both responsible and how be ""both"" argue. I do not argue or get angry at anyone, no one in my life has made me ever this way other than my mom. And my dad sees our arguing as lesser than it is. I'm not exaggerating anything, I don't see any reason why I would to anyone reading. He says ""You have to stop arguing with your mother"" She literally drags it out of me because she is my mother and can hurt me in that personal way. I don't have a right to speak on anything that happened before I was born or before I could remember, but my dad every time I ask him, shrugs it off. ""It's your mother"", or ""later"". He doesn't even try to have serious talk in person and uses text messages to say ""motivational"" stuff on how I need to get it together. He says he has talks with my mom but she never listens. So all I can say at this point is she either has her own issues or some mental problem. Considering my dad won't ever give me an answer.

I'll keep my dad's segment short but he had a role to play in my life. One time I was an idiot kid which we all are and I got gum stuck in my hair. I went home with it in my hair hoping to get it out before my parents noticed. My dad saw it, dragged me the shower, and as he was scrapping it out, he was yelling at me WHO DID THIS?? And I kept telling him I did it on accident. But he didn't believe me. ""WAS IT THAT KID \[insert name here\]?"" while I was crying in the shower. I was in the 4th grade, around 11.

Things have gotten so bad in my household, to where I've felt mostly alone with myself, because I grew up moving a lot (dad is a military man), and I wasn't able to make long time friends. Last November, I made a stupid decision of making suicide threats (unrelated to my mom) but which ended up getting the police called. That too sort of ended with my dad telling me to ""get it together"". He was also threatening me to send me to a psychiatric ward the next day because of an argument the next day after the suicide threat thing.

So how am I? Well my decline started in 7th grade when I realized how bad my mom was and how mean and angry she was. Because even when I was a straight B student. She'd expect all A's, she'd never congratulate me for getting B's because I had been getting good grades my entire life, even though how amazing that is, she'd see it as just average.

I'll keep this part short but joined an honors english class, got stressed, led to my suicide threats, dropped it because of that.

I know I have my own issues. I'm currently failing most of my classes during this covid-19 business and am going to have to take summer school, but I'm being told if I fail this current semester I'm gonna have to repeat sophomore year. I'm learning to get over what happened in my childhood, and to try and move forward but it's been hard considering I've trapped inside with the two people who make my life less bright.

I don't expect anyone to give me an answer I want but I just want people to hear what I have to say because right now I only have one person I really talk to about these issues I face. And I know it's not the biggest problem in the world, considering as my parents put it ""I have shelter, lots of food, and clean clothes"" but after writing this, I feel really broken and shaken up by everything. I was always scared by the idea of a therapist because I thought I wasn't that messed up but. I think it was me thinking about all these events in my life. Make me realize that sometimes the bad outweighs the good. I might start seeing a therapist, don't know how since even before quarantine my life was pretty much, school and house. My parents don't exactly like me outside. Like everytime I went to a birthday part or the one rare time a year I hung out with a friend. My dad would either, be somewhere watching or text me and call me constantly. And if one thing went wrong or seemed off he'd say ""You can't hang out with \[insert name\] anymore.

Sometimes I feel like it's too late, I'm already 16. Damage done. Already broken. What's the point in doing something like, getting my mom and dad to just get away from each other? Might as well just keep going. I honestly do wish my mom and dad did split up from the beginning, they hated each other for awhile. One thing that made me definitely bring a whole new persective to the situation is, my mom was pregnant when they got married. And recently my mom said something about how she was told to ""marry a marine man"". Probably because of the financial benefits. Since she's always asking for military discounts. They have this parasitic relationship. My dad is a very unorganized messy person, and my mom is an ocd neat freak. So they pretty much put out each other's fires. And it's been working but not for me. I never felt really loved back when I was a kid. Because my mom neglected me and my dad was always working. And I just said I loved them because that's what I was told. But even when I see my mom now, it's like a stranger. You may say I'm lucky to realize everything around me but I feel cursed. I wasn't able to even feel happy for a long time at school. I'd like to get my mom help with whatever issue she has. Since she hates everyone and will vocalize it. But I don't know.

If you say I'm overreacting, okay. If you say I'm being ungrateful, okay. It's 1am and I""m just so tired of thinking about this shit considering I've dealt with it severely recently. I just wanted to finally put it out there. But if anyone has anything to say to my story then, feel free.

tldr; very messed up stuff going on in family for years, childhood trauma, mother with issues, my mental health declined for a while, dad who tries to be there",1590788869.0
381,I get attached way too easily,"About 3 months ago I made a friend who just so happened to share a lot of interests with me and we really clicked. We don't know each other for too long but I already feel super comfortable and attached to them. 
Everytime I get a notification I get excited thinking it's them, and when I see it's some other friend of mine that I've had for like 6 years, I get kinda disappointed.
When they're out and can't reply to my messenger, I feel really lonely. It's so weird because everytime I make a new friend that clicks with me, I feel like I can't remember what it was like before they were around and I want to talk only to them. Eventually this excitement stops tho.

I don’t feel like I can keep putting myself out there. I’m desperate to have that special person, and be loved. I know that there will be someone eventually. But it feels like I’m going to keep being alone forever.",1588098816.0
383,Coping with a traumatic experience,"19m   I should just say it here so I don't dance around the topic. At a young age I was raped multiple times.
This had and still has a major effect on my mental health. During the time my performance in primary school dropped behind other students, I couldn't sleep and had regular thoughts of suicide. I became socially inept, struggling to relate to and befriend other kids. I became emotionally numb and reserved. It was the lowest time of my life.
Today I still think back to the moments that scarred me so deeply. To this day I struggle with my sleeping schedule and feeling of self worth. In effect at times I feel lesser than others because of what happened.

With that said I still have methods and rules which push me through bad times. The first and most obvious way of helping yourself in a situation like this is to try your best to be open and talk about it. I first talked to a close friend about it when I was 17, years after the incident. It was the hardest conversation I'd ever had. I couldn't stop crying and when first explaining what I'd been through I could barely speak because of how scared I was. It didn't feel good to talk about it in the moment, but I felt proud after the fact. I felt stronger and more confident. In the last 2 years I've been able to talk to 4 other close friends about it, each time it became easier, and each time I felt secure when my friends assured me it was ok. So that's the most basic and obvious thing you can do to feel better in the long term. 
Coping with suicidal thoughts is kind of a personal mind game I play with myself. The main thing I tell myself when I want to kill myself is that I'm currently better than I ever was. I think back to when I was younger and remind myself of the fact that back then was the worst moment of my life and nothing will ever make me feel as terrible. In essence I didn't kill myself then so I would be stupid to give up now, as if I'm weaker than what I was.
Having a goal set in mind will help steer you away from stagnating in your life. I keep myself busy and in work always targeting myself towards points of improvement. Realistically I don't mind if I live a second rate life since I don't mind as long as I'm alive and still moving forward but it makes things easier if you always strive for better. My current goals are fairly basic. I'm going to learn to drive (I already ride a motorbike but driving is pretty essential to my future). Then I'm going to join the police and help people since I have a strong mind when geared towards justice. Other than that I haven't got much set. Set your basic goals asap to keep you going.
I haven't got much to say about sleep since I still haven't solved it proper but i hope you see something here you could relate to and maybe try apply to yourself. For anyone who's struggled with this before, keep going. We'll be ok someday.",1585781572.0

386,Why do I feel especially lonely during New Years?,"Another New Years passed- whether it be literally alone or at a party with over 50 people. Everything slows down for the ten minutes before and after New Years- and I have a tsunami of sadness drown me from all the champagne corks soaring off, the laughter, or the harmonized “Happy New Years!”.
It’s been this way since I’ve realized the true meaning of life, a nihilist perspective, slowly losing my fascination for the fireworks all around the world, to now crying during these 20 or so minutes of should-be-celebrating.
What do I do?
This year compared to the others have been the worse: I want to end it all. 

Getting this off my chest feels so nice, to be somewhat anonymous and finally saying something instead of questioning myself 24/7. My hands shake and I can’t control myself when anybody asks anything remotely close to any subject like this. I’m burdened with the desire to keep everything quiet.

Thank you.",1577869128.0
387,Emotionally exhausted,"Emotionally exhausted...

My sister’s husband passed away from brain cancer last year and two weeks prior, she was diagnosed with kidney cancer.  She had the cancerous kidney removed and the surgeons also wanted to inject her liver with chemo beads due to a suspicious lesion. But this procedure failed and ended up obliterating her liver. 

Today she left for Mayo Clinic again to have a liver resection after numerous failed attempts at placing stents within the liver. If this fails, the next step is a liver transplant. 

With all of the trips to Mayo Clinic, my parents have given up so much. They take days off of work, when income is already incredibly low, to help my sister with her 2 kids (age 6, & 2). My parents are in their late 50’s and are getting understandably worn down; physically, emotionally, and financially. 

I just wish there was something I could do to help them somehow. The past 18 months have been absolute shit and we just need something positive to keep us going.

388,I keep getting this uncomfortable feeling & it’s overwhelming.,"When I was little, if I(F) went on holidays or spent long periods of time with my father & brothers, I would start to get this really uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach. I don’t know why I used to get this but I did. I couldn’t control it & it overwhelmed me & made me just want to be alone. A lot of the time I actually avoided spending time with my family as a result. 

Over time, I have experienced this feeling multiple times in my life. But it normally goes away. Lately this feeling has come back & it’s worse than ever. It’s kind of like your stomach is in a knot & constantly flipping. Your body feels like it’s floating, you feel on edge about everything, distracted by everything & completely on edge. I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin & it bothers me I have no other way to explain it. 

It’s overwhelming now because I can’t control it & it keeps happening. I felt like I was in a dream falling forever. I felt so helpless & overwhelmed. I don’t know what to do.

I started shaking today as well. Just my body (specifically my arms & hands) everything tensed up & started shaking. I couldn’t breathe properly, then my eyes started watering & I started crying. My body would then stop shaking & I’d be upset but I don’t know why. Then 10-20 minutes later it repeats.

396,How to cope with a break up like this one,"My ex and I started dating three years ago. Since the beginning we had trouble because my parents didn't like our relationship. We were both quite young (late teens) and he was my first boyfriend but eventually my parents accepted him. Initially it seemed like his parents had no issue with our relationship. Our families knew each other because my dad's brother was really good friends with my ex's parents and they would usually hang out together. His parents would always greet me and treat me well, even when dating their son. 

A year later my family gets an opportunity to move abroad while my ex started his second year of university in another city. We decided to continue our relationship despite the distance. My ex mentions that he is happy to move away from his parents. Up to this point I just knew that his parents did things like taking away his phone and computer at night so that he did not use them, they also sometimes read his conversations on social media like messenger or WhatsApp, and they would scold him for every little mistake, but I didn't think much of it until later. 

The time comes when my ex moves to continue with his studies (August) and I move to another country (October). During this time, He slowly started to drop his grades and not attending classes. I tried my best to support him, but he ended up failing some classes and loosing his scholarship. His family was having economic troubles, so this was really important because loosing his scholarship meant he could not study at that university anymore. Then his parents started getting the idea that our relationship was the cause of his drop in grades. In January, his parents threatened him with not paying for his university anymore if he did not end our relationship. I also discovered that his parents were saying things about me to my uncle and aunt behind my back, specially his mother. She was badmouthing me saying that I was a nuisance to his son and a crazy stalker. I have no idea how she got that impression. After a lot of talking we decided to continue our relationship in secret.

Fast forward to August when I returned to my country to visit friends and family. My aunt spoke to me and told me that the relationship they had with my then bf's parents was ruined and that his parents were really controlling. She said that his mother would say that she hit her sons, but I don't know if that is true. She also said that his mother was controlling and manipulating his father. Overall, my aunt told me that I should break things off with him because of his parents. I saw him and I talked to him about it but he said it was a misunderstanding and his parents didn't mean to say that. He told me he would tell the truth to his parents about our relationship so that we didn't have to keep it a secret anymore.

Back home, my boyfriend continued having trouble in university, so he stopped. He went to therapy and discovered that he had anxiety and was put on medication. To pay off the debt he acquired, he returned to his home and started working. He started to isolate himself and he wouldn't talk with me for days when he was feeling down. He told me that every time he fought with his parents, he felt really bad and isolate himself. He said that he was starting to think that his parents were the cause of his anxiety. On March, his parents again threatened him to not allow him to go to university in the future if he did not break up with me. He never ended up telling me what he did, but he told me not to worry anymore and that everything was okay now. He began university again in May at another school, and this time his grades were good.

August again, I went back to visit. He told me that his parents didn't know we were seeing each other. They discovered us and threatened him once again, only this time the threat became reality. 

I am really concerned about him because I don't know what his parents did to him this time so that he had to end things like that. He told me that he would send me a message when he was ready to answer all my questions but I'm still really concerned and I don't know if I should contact him or not. Even if we are not a couple anymore, I just feel concerned about his wellbeing in general and if there is anyway I can help him I'd love to know. I just want him to be okay and safe from his parents. All help is appreciated. I just want to know if there is anyway for me to help him and anyway I can cope with this better as well, because it is eating me up inside.",1567158560.0

403,Apprenticeship from hell,"I have ended up getting an apprenticeship, with a respected company. It's in engineering and so, I am the only girl of the 12 apprentices they brought on. It's a really good apprenticeship in the sense that its an easy gateway into a good company, and I'm getting paid; but I hate it there.

Anxiety - I'm not a very sociable person and not very talkative, I just want to be left alone to do something, but the work involves working with a bunch of macho men and I really just don't fit in. I feel anxious and on edge all day - which is extremely draining - because I feel like an idiot when I can't think of a witty remark to one of their stupid quips. It makes me feel like they think I'm autistic or something because they complain about how quiet I am, when I really don't have anything to say. It's horrible, just the inability to be myself, the lack of respect or empathy they have for me. It's so depressing. I have about 8 rotations in each department, so that's 8 different sets of people to get to know, I'm only in my 2nd department. I'm already not a social person and suffer with social anxiety, so having to adjust each time is hell. I've tried making jokes, but they're so not used to it that they don't seem to get it, and just assume that I'm an idiot instead of my comment being a joke. I desperately hate this and have a massive desire to quit, but I know it's an amazing opportunity I'd be throwing away. 

Depression - The hours are long and the commute is tedious. I don't have a car and so get the train, but I have to wake up at 5.50am to get to work for 7.30am, it's not the journey thats horrible, I'm sad to say it's probably the most enjoyable part of my day, it's the time I waste on the commute, the time I miss to sleep and the awful mood being the first one out of my house at 6am everyday. Sleep is also a massive concern, I get about 6hrs a night which obviously isn't enough, I just find it hard to go to sleep knowing that when I wake up the whole nightmarish cycle will start again. This routine is also ruining any spare time I get at the end of the day. I come home, wanting to spend some time maybe practicing a hobby or trying to learn something new, but I'm just so tired that I fall asleep on my bed until 11pm, get up and go back to sleep when I feel tired again. My parents don't care, nor does my sister, it's just sad to me that any of MY free time I spend making up for my time at work by sleeping. 

I've become moody and irritable and lash out at my family, if they ever bother to talk to me, I have even lost a very close friend because of the way I have been feeling, despite my explanations to him about how much I hate my daily life, he said I had changed since I'd gotten the job (become more moody and irritable) and has since stopped speaking to me, making me feel even more alone. 

Ultimately, I really don't know what to do, I feel stressed, suicidal, depressed and anxious and I really don't see an end, I have a complete apathy over losing my place as apprentice because I hate it so much, but I can't afford to leave as they expect you to pay back training fees; I also don't have any other plans. I have tried searching for other apprenticeships, but this one is the only one that seems reputable enough to have joined. I have so many creative outlets I'd like to be able to explore, but now my life has become committed to a role I don't think I ever really wanted. Now I've tried the role that I thought I'd enjoy, I realise that maybe that's not what I want to do. But I feel screwed as I don't really have any other options. I feel like crying everyday and feel very alone. I'm only 4 months in and I have 4 years to go, plus another 2 years contractually after that. So feeling locked in would be an understatement. 

Thanks for reading that, please if you have any advice I'd really appreciate it. I know it's very self centred, but it's just how I feel 🤷",1556864587.0
404,I don’t know who I am anymore,"I’m in my last year of high school. I go to a very small catholic private school. I have been bullied so much about my appearance that I can’t even look at my own reflection anymore. There are about 17 boys in my year they treat me like a dog, I have to fellow their directions or I would get verbally abused or threats of violence. I can’t tell the school because they would just make it worse, I know this because someone already did that and the bullies got worse for him and he had to leave the school. The school cares more about their image then helping their students. A few days ago I looked at a mirror and my mind went blank and I thought “who are you”. I’m sorry but just don’t know what to do anymore.",1556229180.0

406,I [26] am a mess and don't even know what to fucking do anymore,"I'm going to make a long story short. I grew up insanely conservative and sex was always a dirty topic to talk about. I grew up with a lot of hangups about it. Now I'm older and mentally I don't think there is anything wrong with it but i still have a ton of guilt. 

So I figured out a way to work through it, experience, I just need to DO it. Be uncomfortable, put myself around people who are open about their sexuality and all that stuff and work through it that way. So I started trying to find women online to talk to about sexual stuff in voice chat. I wanted someone who would talk to me, understand where I was at , and the guilt, and all that stuff, but who would encourage me to talk to her about sexual stuff, watch porn, masturbate, ect. To help me realize that its ok and that its not gross or something to be embarrassed about. 

And against all odds occasionally I'll find someone willing to talk to me and help me work through it. Assuming they don't turnout to be one of the people who ghost me, mock me, troll me, or tease me into thinking they are wiling to help only to eventually decide they don't want to cause its funny or something. And then, after a little bit, something will happen, sometimes even before I actually do anything with the person, and I feel super insanely guilty and delete all my accounts, and of course you can't recover reddit accounts so if Ive not talked to them on discord/skype yet then its just gone. Ive lost multiple really cool people, people I enjoyed talking to (not just about sexual stuff) because of it. I remember bits of their name but not enough to find them again. So I'm just shooting myself in the foot. I'm sick of it. 

On top of this is another issue. I'm lonely. I got out of my only relationship about 3 or 4 months ago. it was long distance and I just couldn't do it anymore , the distance was the least of our problems. So at this point there is NO affection in my life, at all. I mean , I have friends, I hangout with them almost every day, and some of them are women. Objectively my life is the best socially that its been in a long time (Thanks to a lot of therapy and hard work). But I still don't have any like, physical contact with people. Sometimes I just want to hug, or I would love to cuddle with a cute girl and watch a movie. I literally can't remember I had any physical contact with someone more than a handshake. As a result I'm borderline desperate at times to feel SOMETHING with SOMEONE, even if its as shallow a connection as talking sexually online. 

So I have multiple issues pushing me to feel like I need to be sexual online, I go back and forth on if I should even feel this way about it and be trying to do what I do, I'm lonely, tired, frustrated, and I am basically making it harder on myself. I'm tired, lonely, borderline on the verge of tears at times, and I just want to have a semi normal conversation, over voice, with a woman and get to know each other and work through this stuff, I just want to hear another voice telling me its ok and that I'm not bad or dirty or whatever. 

The cycle just continues, I can't break free, I don't know how. ",1553585025.0
407,Why does being in my apartment make me more stressed and depressed?,"I've had my own place for over 2 years now, and for probably the last year, I've noticed a bizarre thing happening there.  Regardless of what I'm doing or not doing, or how I'm feeling or not feeling, a feeling of unhappiness, anxiety, and unease creeps into me every day when I stay there for a period of time.  This even extends to the first hours of each morning, when I'm still waking up and getting a shower and drinking coffee while looking out the window at the sky.

My mind seems to go to how I feel like I'm not responsible, capable, productive, successful, or worth anything when in this mode.  The problem is that even when I actively work on tasks specifically targeted at solving those problems and doing something with my life, if I'm still at my place, I still feel antsy and ashamed.

I recently spent the last weekend visiting my family's house in another town, and the feeling was not quite as severe, even though I was pretty lazy those days compared to most others.  I'm spending most of this week either at my workplace, at public places like libraries, or at groups and events to keep busy and possibly meet more people.  But it seems ridiculous that I can't spend more than a few minutes in my own home without feeling wrong or off, and I want to figure out why it's happening.",1547666052.0

409,My cat died and it's really messing me up.,"I know that may not seem like much to some people, may seem trivial or stupid, even.  But not to me.  He wasn't just a cat to me.


For years he was right there everyday I came home from work.  He was always the first one to come running and greet me and the door.  He was happy to see me.  He'd sit and cry—loud, mournful wails—until I picked him up and held him.  I'd cradle him, like one would a baby.  Most cats don't like that but it was his favorite way to be held.  I'd hold him and pet him and he'd purr.  We'd stand there like that for about twenty minutes.  Everyday.  


He would always sleep with me at night.  He'd curl up on my feet.  That was his spot to sleep.  Curled up by my feet with his chin on my foot.  On really cold nights he'd sometimes get under the blankets, curl up against my chest and stay there all night.  


Before I would leave the house in the mornings I would run the lint roller over my clothes.  He started getting onto the chair by the door and crying until I ran the lint roller over him, too.  He'd sit there, purring and looking at me.  


He had the sweetest face.  Such expressive eyes.  He always looked like he was smiling.  


But he was sick.  He had FeLV (feline leukemia).  And then kidney disease.  And he died last Saturday at the age of 7, nearly 8.  I actually had to have him euthanized.  He was sick.  Toward the end he just slept more and ate less and I was so hopeful he would just sleep and not wake up.  But that didn't happen.  The last day it was evident he had taken a turn for the worse and was in discomfort.  I couldn't  let him suffer.  I did what I had to do.  


And I've never cried so hard or so much in all my life.  


See, he came into my life several years ago right before my mother died.  I was an only child of an only child and my old man was never in the picture.  So it was always just me and my mom.  I was the proverbial mama's boy.  So I got down, really, really down after she died.  To the point where I wasn't thinking too clearly and considering stupid things.  


But I didn't do it.  I didn't do it because of him.  There would have been no one to take care of him.  I kept going because of him.  When I had literally no reason to live, I lived for him.  He saved my life.  


He was my best friend.  I never stayed a night away from home in all the time he was with me.  He'd been born into an animal hoarder situation and was mistreated so he didn't trust anyone.  Anyone except for me.  And he took to me immediately.  And I to him.  


Like I said, he saved my life.  And I think he knew how important he was to me.  At the end, when it was evident he should have just gone, even when I told him he could go, he wouldn't.  When, on the last day, he finally couldn't eat or drink or even walk, he wouldn't let go.  He was so strong.  I really believe he wanted to be strong to stay with me.  I just couldn't let him do that anymore.  It wasn't fair to him.  I loved him too much to watch him suffer anymore.


I cried for hours.  For days.  It felt like someone had scraped my throat with dull knives.  Like they had hit me in the ribs and punched me in both eyes.  


Part of it was because he was so strong.  If he hadn't been sick he would have lived forever.  And it pisses me off that he was screwed out of that life.  Because someone was so careless with him in his first days on this planet.  It pisses me off almost as much as—when he was still an outdoor cat, when he first found his way to me as a stray escaped from that awful house and before he came inside to stay—I had a neighbor who I saw kick him.  I took him inside and came back out with a gun.  I stuck that gun in my neighbor's face.  I threatened to kill someone for that cat.  


He saved my life.  He loved me unconditionally.  He was always there for me.  He made my life better.  I would have died for him.  I would have killed for him.  More than that, I lived for him.  When there was no other reason to live, I lived for him.  


That wasn't a cat that died.  It wasn't a pet.  That was my son.  


My son is dead.  


I know that may sound ridiculous to some people.  Maybe they can't understand how one can feel that way about “just a cat.”  But no one has to understand.  They just have to accept that's what he was to me.  


I can't stop thinking about him.  I miss him so much.  


I'll move on, I know I will.  But I don't think I will ever get over this.  I made peace with it when my mom died.  It was difficult but it's because there was a peace there.  She died a peaceful death, in a good place in her life.  There was a comfort there, in that.  But this is different.  There's no good here.  He was taken too soon for stupid reasons and it couldn't even be gentle.  I'm miserable.  And pissed.  And heartbroken.  And I miss him.  For nothing.  For no good goddamn reason at all.  


And I don't know how to get beyond that.  I don't think I can.


I'm sorry for the long rant.  I don't really expect any advice or help.  I don't know what to expect.  I just needed to say what I had to say.  I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time.  If you read this far, thank you.

412,Am I doing something wrong,"I’m a 16/f and I’ve been trying my hardest to be a good daughter but nothing is working anymore. In the last couple month my dad has been making me feel like I’m a menace of a kid. When I don’t was dished or clean my room he acts as if I can’t do anything right. I understand I have an attitude at times but he blows it way out of proportion.(when I began to clean the bathroom my dad gave me an ultimatum he said if I don’t fix my attitude in the next 6 months I’m going to live with my mom.)last week my brother left me for school because I woke up late, I had five minutes to get ready and I asked my brother to wait on me,he agreed but when I came out 5 minutes later he left. I had to find a ride to school from a friend and I left my phone in her car. I asked my brother to take me to her her house to retrieve my phone, he asked my dad, my dad said no.My dad asked me why it was my brothers responsibility to take me to go get my phone, he said if I wanted it I need needed to walk.her house was a 4 minute drive but 20-30 minute walk. He told me to wait after thanks giving break to get it back if I didn’t want to walk in 30 degree weather.Another example is I was laying in our guest room when my dad burst in and asks what I’m doing in there. I ask him “I can’t be in here” he told me I have no business to be in there and to get out. One more example is when I slammed my door he ran into my room and yelled in my face spitting about how he was going to whoop my butt if I slammed it again. A few minutes ago my brother asked me for a pillow that he only wants because I have it. I told him to get out of my face, but my dad intervened saying that that’s what I wasn’t going to do. My brother said he wanted it to “relax” (it’s a neck pillow you’d use on an air plane) I told him he didn’t need it and my dad replied but making me give it to him.I throw the pillow in his direction but he doesn’t catch it. My dad yells at me. I pick it up, my brother has his hands out, I dropped it, and my brother let it fall through his hands. My dad then makes a remark on how I’m making his decision easier by making me go to my moms. There are many more examples of this but I’m really tired of this and I’m sick of being treated this was.

415,How can I cope with my partner being involved in my SA,"I'm sorry to make a post like this but my experience has been bothering me for such a long time: I want to get it off my chest and ask quite honestly if I'm a victim of SA, if i have ptsd, if im a bad person for wanting closure from my equally traumatized gf, and how i can get help before its too late.

I've heard about many others SA experience before, and in comparison I feel like what I went through means nothing, but it haunts me everyday and it is really affecting my relationship with my current girlfriend because she was involved (more on that later). 

TW: potential sa, coercing.etc

Me, girlfriend (we were not together at the time), and other guy went to college for the same major and lived in residence together during our first year of college. I was a very guarded person at this time due to other friendships gone sour, but both had managed to regain my trust after some time together. Guy always hit on me and gf, both of us usually brushed it off but also didn't discourage it. 

Worth noting that gf was fresh going through a breakup at the time that she was taking very hard. Her mental health was on the decline and she was also dealing w trauma elsewhere that I won't get into. 

One day, all 3 of us were hanging out at guy's dorm room watching tv. I don't remember how we got on the topic, gf began to suggest I put a condom on guy just to learn how to do it (I had never been intimate w a man before at that level), I felt awkward initally, but both seemed completely fine with it so I was willing to try it out bc it might be helpful in the future if I ever did go there with a guy. However, after that things quickly escalated and gf was giving guy a handjob, I immediately felt weird about the situation and where it was going. Eventually she insisted I ""go next"". 

I didn't want to be ""the mood killer"" and these were people I considered my close friends. They insisted that this way I could ""learn"" and get feedback from guy in case I ever wanted to be with a man (I identified at bi at the time). I didn't care about any of that but I did it anyway, because I didn't want them to be mad at me. 

Eventually, gf moved onto the next level and began to give him a bj, and then again, told me it was my turn. I told her I didn't want to immediately. Again both insisted that I needed to learn, I told them I didn't care and that I'd learn some other way but not like this. They told me this was the best way, this went on for about ten minutes. At some point guy got up to where i was sitting and pointed his stuff in my face, and I pulled away, he then put his stuff on my legs and I continued to be freaked out and say no.

They then said ""fine"", guy made a snide comment about me being boring, and gf smiled. I remember this distinctly because it hurt me the most out of anything that happened. They continued to be intimate with eachother while I was still in the room, and once they were done other friends showed up at guy's room and we hung out with eachother for a little bit. Once the night ended and I went to my dorm I cried. 

Later on, after a bunch of apologies from gf when I finally told her how hurt I was, she told me she was disassociating, and 2 years later, now dating, she tells me that she doesn't remember a lot of what happened and why she did it (she doesnt remember a lot from that year bc of her own trauma) She's changed immensely since then, and has been great to me, but these memories haunt me and I've asked her about what happened alot. But I feel like such a bother because overtime it has started to make her upset and really down toward herself thinking shes an awful gf and person. Everytime I bring it up to her I just end up hurting her and upsetting myself. But I'm so desperate for closure. We have both cut guy off. 

Guy was really into metal/rock music, and now whenever I hear a song I think he did or would listen to, it immediately ruins my mood and makes me remember everything. Whenever I see a picture of him, or ESPECIALLY pictures of him and gf together, I want to cry and throw up. 

I'm so confused about everything, I feel like it isn't that serious. I know I want to forgive gf and continue to be happy w her bc otherwise we have a great relationship and I never wanna lose that, but this continues to hang over my head. 

If you read through all of this, I thank you dearly, I know it's a lot and I'm sorry it's all such a mess. I'm sorry that I talked about things in detail, but I just wanted to provide as much context as possible so people understand what the situation was like cause it's a lot more complicated than I was SA'd and I almost feel like I'm not justified in calling it that.",1658450113.0

I know this may sound weird but I feel naked without a face mask.
I think I have developed some sort of social anxiety during the pandemic because I hate being around too many people. 
I have a lot of insecurities because I got cheated on in a previous relationship of 5 years and never really fully got over it.
I have a big nose and I think my lips are too small. I am super insecure about this. I am actually considering getting my lips done in the near-ish future and a nose job one day down the road. Anyways, I felt better with the face mask because it hid those features I'm insecure about. Now that they are no longer required, I get really anxious when going out. I feel more insecure than ever and I have this new anxiety about being around people.
Especially when I go out with my fiancé. I am always worried about other prettier girls around us because I automatically feel inferior.

424,I lied about graduating and I lied about being in law school. How do I admit to this with dignity?,"
Preface: I know how ludicrous, absurd, and horrid I am and my actions are. Although this is inexcusable, it’s difficult to offer advice without knowing why someone would do any of this on purpose. I’m a 25 year old woman who’s had high ambitions and high levels academic anxiety. My adolescence is tainted with borderline physically abusive and very verbally abusive father and a manipulative mother. Could I have still achieved everything I wanted and more if I tried? Yes. I’m not the victim here but my title makes me sound like a sociopath without context. I love my parents but I don’t like them. I worked as a paralegal for 3 years. I was supposed to graduate online and I never got to because I suck. 

I still applied to law schools and told them I was scheduled to graduate. I actually got waitlisted a lot of schools I applied to even though I didn’t graduate. 

I’m living at my parents condo in the city. I know you’re probably thinking damn, you’re spoiled AND stupid. Well the apartment isn’t just for me it’s for my younger sister who is still in high school and lives with me here instead of commuting back and birth to where my parents live (1h away). 

They said they would kick me out and never talk to me again if I didn’t get into a law school. It literally doesn’t make any sense knowing that I graduated for me not to get in literally anywhere. So I told them I got into the lowest level school. I’m not in law school. I’m still trying to take the last 10 fucking credit hours to get my stupid BS diploma. 

Anyway my dad knows that he has to pay for my semester and I’ve been delaying it like crazy. He refused to let me take out a loan. I needed to pay off my actual college credits anyway so I wanted to have him pay for that. 

My dad called me today and said he wanted to see the actual login information and see where he has to pay. I told him to give me his account and routing numbers. I would take it and then hold off on paying anything for the longest amount of time possible. My dad eventually said I have ti log in front of him for him to pay. 

Basically I’m at a point if no return. I’ve fallen to my knees and cried to myself helplessly alone so many times over this. I’ve called the suicide help hotline and I’ve been told to tell my parents because they won’t be angry they’ll feel sorry that their daughter felt the need to do this in the first place. Well, that’s not going to happen. I’ve been hiding academic information from my parents as long as I can remember. My dad used to break pencils, scream, and hit me when he helped me with my math homework. He would berate my intelligence in front of my sister yet compliment hers. Could I have still gotten over that and left my parents condo and do what I was supposed to do for myself? Yes! But I didn’t and now I have to manage that. 

I’ve always wanted to leave my parents grasp but my dad kind of makes it impossible. He has me listed as his employee. It helps him more than it helps me tbh. They’ve let me live in their condo in the city while I collect all the money I made as a paralegal. 

My dad is expecting me to come home and login and show him how to pay for this. I have a feeling he secretly knows that I lied about this. I’m embarrassed. I’m ashamed of myself. I feel like a criminal even though I know I’m not. I did this because I’m a coward. I know once the truth comes out I will hide and not talk to my parents for a long time. I will probably not talk to my friends either. 

I also do want to be a lawyer very much. I really do. I’m not giving that up for shit. Working and going to school at the same time is incredibly difficult. 

Anyways: I want to hold off on telling my dad until thanksgiving. But if I can’t, what is the best way to tell him with integrity( the little I have left) and dignity. 

TLDR; I fucked up by not telling anyone I didn’t graduate college. I have 10 credits left. I worked for 2 years as a paralegal and told my family I was going to apply to law school at the same time. I lied and said I got into a law school. My dad insists on paying. I’m going to get caught and I need to find a way to tell the truth without looking like a complete garbage bag.",1637784449.0

437,WHY DO I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO IS A WASTE OF MY TIME?,"WHY DO I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING IS A WASTE OF MY TIME?

Hello, 

Here’s a rant for you because during this time I feel I have no one to speak to who understands how I am feeling so I am reaching out to this platform for enlightenment. 

It all started over a year ago now - in 2018 I broke up with my short term partner at the time and moved provinces. During this transition and first 2 months into moving I began drinking nearly 4 times a week with my roommates. Drinking and working as a housekeeper. 

Fast forward to December 2018, I started dating one of my roommates - my now best friend and still current partner. This turned out to be really good for me at the time as I stopped my dumb ass drinking and began smoking weed with him instead. 

Smoking weed made me feel better, etc. 
I’ve gone through a few phases of weed/tobacco addiction in the past and so therefore smoking weed was nothing new to me. And so it began, my smoking from Dawn - Dusk phase, all over again. 

In the beginning it felt good, I was enjoying it, I felt productive (I’ve always generally felt myself to be a productive stoner) I am able to function at work and in other social situations, etc. 

The weed phase got dark when I moved provinces again, this time with my partner in 2019. We moved to my hometown and I started smoking 10x more.. If that’s even possible. This is when Covid began in the world as well. And also my darkest and most depressed time in my life. 

Fast forward to now, I have moved provinces AGAIN with my partner. We’ve been living in a new province for 6 months now and not much has changed since the last province in my story lol. 

I puff on my bong from dusk til dawn with Tobacco mixed into my marijuana. All that interests me is smoking weed, laying in bed, watching YouTube and scrolling on my phone. It’s almost as if I don’t want to do any of the stuff I feel I need to do because it’s taking away from my nothing time. I want to do nothing. Nothing and smoke. I started feeling HEAVY anxiety before work everyday for the past year now, and don’t get me wrong. I have a good job but it STRESSES me out. I am a manager at Dominos Pizza. 

I make endless lists and plans of things I want to do and then when it comes down to it on my days off I do NOTHING,, I feel anything I want to do is a waste of time because I only have ** hours til work left. 

I also have a horrible sleeping/eating just all around horrible self care pattern. I don’t take care of myself on most days and I don’t want too. 
Some may say I am depressed but I don’t necessarily feel depressed.. I get out of bed and eat sometimes. I go to work. I smoke my bong. I watch inspiring videos. 
SOMETIMES I even meditate, do yoga and read. But these come very rarely to me now which is unusual. I used to be a stoner and still go to the gym everyday... I would even get high BEFORE going to the gym. 

Crazy how things can change. For some context, I am 23 years old and all I dream of is a life I don’t want to take a vacation from. But I can’t find it in me to do that so I waste my time and end up feeling horribly guilty for not doing anything productive with myself everyday. 

The first 2 months of 2021 have literally flew by and I feel like I am living an almost out of body experience and I want out. I don’t live in the present, fuck I don’t even care about the present. Just the future and the past and the crippling anxiety that comes along with being an unproductive stoner. 

Thanks for listening & PLEASE if you are going through something similar or have any advice regarding getting out of this weed addiction, then reach out. I’d love to hear some feedback on my situation... maybe I’m depressed and don’t realize it? Or maybe my brains fried like scrambled eggs and dopamine only comes when I think of smoking a bong? (My brain when I smoke a bong: AH finally something I can accomplish and oh look how EASY it is to do... might as well puff another 2)",1614541397.0

439,I hate myself and everyone around me,"I know a lot of my descriptions may seem superficial but please but yourself in my shoes. I'm a 19M uni student in Charlotte. I suffer from clincally diagnosed OCD, Depression, and PTSD and who knows what else. I am also a virgin, I had my first kiss 3 days before my 19th birthday. I was bullied everyday from grades k-12. A lot of it was implicit racism (kid of Indian parents living in the US) like always being left out and made fun of for every little thing and nobody did anything to stop it because it's socially acceptable to treat Indians differently I guess... I also dealt with physical bullying too. I also lived in a toxic and emotionally abusive home before moving to college. 

Please don't assume that I'm crazy or insane for what I'm about to say: because of my lack of promiscuity in my life, other people's promiscuity bothers me beyond belief. I met someone who was in the same boat as me and I felt so much better about myself for a while... until he got laid and didn't have to worry about it anymore. Now im really the only one. It's not that I'm ugly or don't try. I know that I'm legitimately decent looking and I have a really good personality, one that people try to take advantage of. Yesterday, my ""friend"" was in the car talking load af about this girl he fucked earlier and was going into detail about it, he was talking on the phone to someone else about it so I couldn't tell to him to stfu. I can't stop hating myself for every little thing. I hate that I'm in this position and that I have to figure this out, as if I haven't dealt with enough already.

 I literally go out of my way to do good because that's what I'd want for myself, but it doesn't seem like my good karma points are paying off. It's gotten so bad that I can't stand anything about sex, or even the mention of it. I love music, especially hip hop and rap but I can't listen because of sex references. I literally stopped watching the YouTuber, Troydan, because he said ""if you're not getting laid in 2021, you're not trying."" Holy fuck that pissed me off beyond relief. Lately I've just been eating, sitting in my room and getting stoned and drunk all day

 I'm not a religious person at all, but I'm strangely compelled to belive that I have a demon inside of me and that most people around me of not everyone, is a demon trying to summon the demon within me. I know it sounds crazy and I'm not saying that I belive that, but that is what my brain or conscious is telling me. I can't even beat my meat because I can't stop thinking of all the graphic details my friend mentioned or think about other people and get jealous. I know I'm crazy, I do take medication, I do have a therapist but he isn't available for 2 weeks right now. I dont feel like I can trust anyone, not even myself... so here I am.

453,I keep fantasizing getting tormented by my ex,"We were great, we had everything. three years and six months of my life just, gone. I've been abused by my parents for nearly my whole life, most days I wouldn't get food and I was constantly shut down by my mama. My dad's been home only half of my life. When I first met my ex girlfriend it felt like all the pain went away, like I was in heaven. Right after I met her I had a bad night at church came home and just slipped away with my meds, my parents took me to the ER and I later got transferred into inpatient at a mental hospital for the next few months. Every night I was there I'd think about her, I would always talk about how amazing she is and I how much I miss her with the other folk in the hospital. After I discharged we hooked up and everything was great, I was so happy, and I thought she was too. two years pass by and I start relapsing because of my parents, and I poured the stress down onto her, I needed someone to listen to me.

454,"New SIL, with 'PTSD'","My daughter (F30) got married this year, to my new SIL (M37). Baby was born happy & healthy last month. Yeah! 1st grandkid!

She stubbed her toe, and he says, ""You better get it checked out, to know how bad it really is"".

I heard him, they were at my place, which is pretty often, and not really a problem.

Until it is. I said to him, that's a pretty negative way to say that.

He flips out. Sarcastically called me DAD for the first time ever. Told me in very threatening way NOT to tell him what to do. turned his back in a primal way, then yelled his version to his wife, my daughter.

Very shortly afterward, they packed their things, he walked back & forth in my drive smoking, then drove off.

I need to resolve this, but I'm at a loss as to how. What words do I use?

Back story: His Dad was (apparently) a piece of work. Called him names, (gay, sissy...) and for the 1 year I've known him, I fear he would be willing to never see us (my wife & me, the grandparents) or at least hold this over me (us).

I was seriously trying to point out some poor choice of words, that's all. I had no idea just how sensitive he is. I've known he has an issue, but never really saw it first hand.

I realize I'll only likely get one shot at trying to talk with him, and if I don't hit all the right buttons, he will blame me ENTIRELY.

They are very stressed new parents, and his job isn't going to great, because of his temper. Everyone I know that he knows realizes his temper; sees it for what it is. Call it PTSD, call it what ever you like.

I'm simply looking for resolution. I want a positive relationship between everyone involved. It takes a village, after all.

459,Suicide,"Background:
Recently my dad got laid off. I'm his dependent university student. I live in his house. He may have to move, and sell the house if he can't find a job here. My mom just passed in November from cancer. I have been diagnosed with autism, bipolar disorder, and ADHD.  

Recently, I've been overwhelmed with the stress of having to figure my life out. Up until COVID19, I had just been moving along with my life. Working towards my degree. School is really hard for me. It's hard for me to focus on getting the work done. I have a 4.0 and I'm working as an unpaid UTA and an unpaid undergraduate researcher. So I've been making it work. But recently I have no energy. When quarantine happened, I fell into an abyss of depression and apathy. I barely finished the semester with A's. Now, I have to find a job and move potentially within the month. My father said he's gonna try to stay for at least the next year. Which definitely takes some of the stress away. I don't know how I'm gonna make next semester work. Working part time could be push my workload over. In already always busy. Especially if I'm still depressed. I wish I could just work more efficiently, but my mental health issues are limiting in that way. My health insurance ends in October, and with that so does my therapy.

Because of the stress and depression, I've been feeling extremely lethargic and apathetic towards everything. I have no energy for anything anymore. I just want to sleep and escape the conflicting stress and depression. I've been extremely self destructive. I recently started vaping nicotine, purely because it was available and I wanted to feel better. Invasive suicidal thoughts have taken over any unoccupied time I have. I don't want to die. I don't want to hurt my little sister or the rest of my family, but I don't know how to cope with my life as it falls apart. Nothing feels safe anymore. I woke up at 5 PM today and missed my therapy session.  Please help me figure out this mess. I dont know how much time I have before I do something rash and/or self-destructive.",1594088893.0
460,How can I communicate better when I regress into a trauma state?,"Some back story, when I was younger my dad and step-dad both physically attacked me after I turned 18. I didn't have the worst childhood, but there was always fighting no matter if I was at my mom's or my dad's, and I deal with a lot of anxiety (and relationship anxiety) because of it. My step dad has injured me, and my bio dad threatened to take my life while strangling me, in a drunken stupor.

I have talked extensively about these events in therapy and I'm able to address that they happened, that I'm ""safe now,"" and that they won't happen again. It's been almost 5 years since these things happened and I feel like I've done a really good job trying to move on from them. The problem is, sometimes certain things trigger me to be sort of...sent back to the times where I feared for my life and they've been affecting my current relationship.

Some other backstory, my s/o also has some traumas that they've dealt with, but still affect them, too. They feel like they were never allowed to be angry when they were younger, and some really messed up relationship situations happened. Where this unfortunately connects with my own traumas is that, any time he raises his voice or starts to get angry, I start gearing up for him to hit me. I know logically that's not true and I tell myself over and over that it won't happen, but I start panicking anyways and I go to this almost primal survival place in my head, where I get super abrasive and emotionless all at once. I guess you could call it dissociation, it's sort of like that.

When I dissociate/regress, I really struggle to explain why I am in that mental state. It's like everything shuts down and I really struggle to talk about even little, nonsensical thoughts I am having. I struggle to focus on anything but surviving or (not to be morbid) dying on my own terms. I know this is a super extreme reaction to normal behavior, but even after 5 years and endless therapy sessions I feel like I'm just not getting it right. I am frustrated and sad, because my boyfriend deserves to feel like he can express his anger, and I deserve to feel safe. We talked a bit about what we could do better to accommodate one another's traumas, and he agreed that he would ask for space more and verbalize needing that while upset, so that I can make myself scarce and feel safe myself. I would like to do something similar and be better about communicating what is upsetting me, but I feel like my survival instincts make me clam up and make it impossible to mention it because I'm so sure he's going to hit me, even though he's never done that and I know logically he never would.

Sorry this is so long, thank you for reading this far if you have. If anyone here has worked through similar and might have ideas for how to get through this mental block, I'd be especially grateful.",1592953334.0
461,Feeling a bit sad today.,"Exactly a year ago, me and my 2 friends made something legendary. That was a Roblox account. Let me explain. Today is the one year anniversary of one of the best days of the school year. The field trip was awesome, and so was the bus ride. While we were on the bus to that field trip, me and my 2 friends, (let’s call them Rachel and Sally) decided to make a Roblox account. As simple as that. A few days after that, we were playing on that account nonstop. We pranked people, played together, trolled, ect. Tons of memories. We had so much fun on it up until about 2 months ago. Rachel took over the account completely. She started online dating, making new friends, and completely ruining all of the fun. She was completely changing, not half the person I used to know. Now, I’d advise you to read my previous posts on this sub, to understand the entire story. Both of those people aren’t really talking to me. Sally is fine with me, but Rachel really isn’t. Now that I have lost those friends, the one year anniversary just feels very sad. Looking back on all of the amazing memories I had with my close friends just makes me feel lonely and empty.

If I ever have children, I don't want them to meet my dad until he changes his views whether or not they are white or black.  Growing up I came to view the phrase ""these people"" as a kind of slur because he would say that followed by something messed up about race. I would get angry and tell him off. It was stressful and due to that and other issues I had with my father being overly controlling I saw the school psychologist when I was in high school.  I was scared to talk about George Floyd and the whole movement. I did talk about it a bit yesterday with him. I want to make him not racist anymore.

468,I don’t know what to do for my girlfriend!,"do not know how this trigger thing works, but I’m just tag this with the content warning off Child Sexual Abuse, Rape mention, etc.

Hey. I’m slowly going nuts. I have a girlfriend and she is the most wonderful girlfriend I’ve had thus far. Out of all the people I had to put up with, she is the best. She is the most loyal to me.

But she has a problem. A big, big problem. She has confessed to me due to sexual abuse, she is mentally unready for horror movies and kidnapping movies. Okay, inconvenience, but not a prob. That’s not the problem though. The prob is that she reads too much fanfiction depicting rape. She melted down and confessed this to me yesterday, saying she was a failure, a waste, etc. No, she doesn’t want others to be raped, but gets off at the thought of herself being raped. She just gets triggered at horror because she doesn’t like the thought of others facing a worse fate than death.

Again I feel guilty , I love her.. but I cannot stand this anymore. She’s having so much mental breakdowns that I almost had a freak out on her. She’s too crazy for me. I want her to get better, but I feel like this is for her own good. When I told her this, she said she’s damaged and that I don’t deserve a demon like her. That she’ll be happy when I’m “free”.

I’m crying, I just feel scared of her.. I don’t know what to do. I’m not a psychiatrist. I also posted this on AITA, but it’s against guidelines. I just need help I can’t stand this!",1588307362.0
469,being angry at someone who avoids situations involving anger,"i’m so angry and i feel like i try so hard to find ways to improve the relationship between me and this guy but he always ends up just being mad then leaving the problem wherever it is and never offers anything, like his thoughts or plans moving forward (and why i expect this is because i always think through and then tell him - what went wrong, why it happened, what i can do next and how i would like him to help). and why i would really like his response is because he has these expectations of me that i honestly don’t find normal in a standard relationship and he doesn’t articulate what he wants because he expects me to put myself in his shoes - which yes i can - but no i cant do what he wants because im not him and i dont know what he thinks is right or wrong or what he likes or dont like (and i say this based on past experiences - i know we dont view the same things the same way)

he says he cares about me but it just doesnt seem so when im expected to solve every problem on my own when much of it involves him too. so i feel really angry but maybe im just angry at myself because at the end of the day i tell him “ok i will work on it and try to do it myself as best i can because i still dont think i should give up on the relationship”  (and everyone i’ve talked to like friends, strangers, and even internet articles i’ve read or similar reddit posts said/indicate i should just walk out on this relationship) 

i dont want to give up on the rs but how should i get past this anger and feeling that im treated unfairly? i know that avoiding the issues isnt it but i cant confront it either (tried and tested). how can one let go of anger/a grudge against another when the other is basically a silent wall? oh he’s also said before that he doesnt want to be around someone when he knows the person is angry at him - so if we were together and i mention that im angry he’d just walk off and not address anything",1587622499.0

471,An old enemy comes back every so often and I don’t know what to do,"Back in 6th grade, I’m in 7th now, there was this kid named Samuel. He was in most kids eyes a perfect person, smart, funny, charismatic, and very strong for his age. We were in the same friend group. But I was his punching bag for some reason I don’t understand, he would hold me down in tag to make sure I could become it, insult me for no reason, even punch me at some points, fuckin horrible time. I dreaded going to school because of him. I cried myself to sleep every Sunday knowing he would be waiting. I didn’t tell because I wanted to stay in the group, something I regret now and can’t change. I didn’t have many friends as I wasn’t very funny or outgoing. Didn’t help I liked this girl and had nightmares where they dated or kissed in front of me. So I lived like this, for a school year. Then summer came around, in order to forget him I forced myself to not think about school or anything related to him. I kept my mind on anything else. And soon I forgot him. When I thought the name Samuel I thought of my brother who has the same name. But then one day, our school hosted a dine-out at a pizza place. And for the first time in months I saw him. He had left the school but his brothers didn’t.

472,Had to help an old lady and old man while shopping today. Here’s the story.,#foodlion  Holy cow. Today in Waldorf I had to save the life of a 66 year old lady.  I had on my mask and gloves and I was shopping at the food lion for some noodles that Aiden likes when a couple of isles over I hear a man calling for help for over 10 seconds.  I run over and people are just staying away and looking at the old man holding his wife.  I jumped in and told him my name and that I will try and help him because I know CPR  and first aid.  I ask him to let her go and that we needed to lie her down.  As we laid her down she took her last’s breaths and her tounge stuck out and her eyes where blank.  She topped breathing and moving and lost her pulse and was getting purple.  I started CPR and I told the old man he needed to help me blow in her mouth.  After over a minute of me doing compression and him doing the mouth to mouth.  She finally let out a gasp of air and slowly started to breath on her own.  A cop came a few minutes later but he didn’t want to get close and basically helped get the crowd out of the way.  The ambulance came like 7-8 minutes later she didn’t regain counciousness until she got in the ambulance.  It was too much for me to go back and continue shopping.  People where scared and thought she was dying from Corona virus or that she was infected and where scared to help her.  But I highly doubt it. A life is worth helping.  I asked the man if she had been sick at all recently and he said she had heart problems and she is diabetic.  I’m not sure what happened to her but She lives and he was so glad and happy that she survived.  Let’s keep hoping miracles like this happen.  I couldn’t let that old lady die her husband was practically crying for help and no one was helping him not even the workers there.  People where scared.  Some ran out. Understandably in these scary times people are scared but we need to literally help one another.

475,I’m getting verbally abused at school and have had enough,"This is a very embarrassing topic. On account I’m male 17 turning 18 in a couple of weeks and in year 12 my last year of high school. I am about to be an adult and am starting to get a lot of adult type responsibilities. And so I am very responsible and do not rarely act childish or do child like stuff, nor do I like it when others play around with me or expect me to laugh at their childish jokes. I also act responsible as I learnt growing up from my older brothers is the best choice. They are all just about in their 20’s now and neither of them made it past year 10. Mainly because they got into situations where people would play around with them and they got into fights, all 3 getting either expelled from school or decided to discontinue school the furthest one made it was to year 10. I also grew up with them. As they are uneducated there was not much solving issues out verbally and I would get into fights with them constantly even though they are much stronger then me and older. And so this is where I must get my strength from.

Ever since I began this year of school, my parents and older sister is so proud of me for making it to year 12, without getting into any serious confrontations with anyone and overall being the bigger man. But this being responsible a bigger man has come at a cost. People think that I am weak just because I choose not to fight people when I have a problem. And so this year I have been getting verbally abused by most people in my friend group. Them calling me weak and saying ""when have you ever fought someone, your weak"". Things just trying to fire me up. I know when I get mad I do not stop and so I contain myself. I have fought my siblings who are bigger and stronger than me. This bullying is starting to get to me, as I have warned them countless times to draw the line. But they continue to do anything to get a reaction out of me. And so I am to the point where I have had enough and want to fuck up anyone who gets on my nerve as warnings seem not to work. 

It’s strange to me they’re picking on me because I’m bigger than them, probably stronger than them but they pick on me just because I am quiet and a responsible person. And so the main question is what should I do, when you have drawn the line with people and they continue to cross it should you result to physical violence.",1582018152.0

My life has been going by very quickly and I seem to be missing all of it. I hate my job, my days blend together and I feel I don’t have enough time for anything. I have little social interaction at work and when I do it’s with people 2.5 times my age. I sit at my desk all day doing monotonous office work with only my thoughts. I have plenty of friends on top of my girlfriend but I feel like I do not have enough time to handle any of them. I can only see them at night which is leading to doing the same things over and over. 

I’ve slowly been losing interest in my hobbies and always feel like crying. I feel I’m not home enough for my family who let me live home for free, and I feel I have no time for myself as I try to fit in a social life. I have applied to many other jobs that would fit my passion, but I’ve received no offers back. Which is only making me feel worse.

I feel trapped, without this job I wouldn’t be able to pay my student loans, but it is driving me into a crazy downward spiral. I haven’t felt happy in a long time and I can’t imagine a life like this.

I had been promoted again, into another role that is more exclusive and more big picture planning rather than the engine room grunt work.

I knew the people I'd be working with and I had been at the company for 5 years coming into my 6th.

I took on my new role ready to crush it.
 Then.... 

My only coworker punch another employee and didn't get into trouble for it.

I ws hospital bound and my coworker wouldn't. Stop calling me asking work questions he should know the answer to.... As in 1hr calls 3-4 times a day while I'm in my hospital bed. I say you need to talk to our boss... Then I get a call back telling me my boss has said for me to deal with it... Still in hospital, it was very serious I had 4-5 weeks off work house bound. Went back to work coz I run out of sick leave it was 3 months recovery... The real flu


I find out that my coworker hasn't done anything for the year, he'd only been marketing things off as 'done'. I told. My boss, he did nothing but it was left to me to complete my coworkers 'done' work. 

My coworker also wasn't at his desk for most of the day... So much so, my bosses boss and all of upper management busted him. 

I decided that I didn't want to be friends with my coworker anymore, so I gave him a lot of space and stopped doing his work for him. 

Then I hear (with my ears) my coworker bitching and gossiping about me to other people. Really nasty things too. We also had the same small group of friends, total number of 4. I let it go and not worry about it. 

Im still having weekly meetings with my boss about ways to get the work done without making my coworker do work.... And my boss is hand balling my coworker to me to take care of... Which doesn't go well. I'm suppose to follow him up all the time to make him do work. I don't like it, I say that my boss should be doing this. 

So I follow up my coworker and ask for the work to be done because I allocate all the work and so the workflow. Then he will say one thing then do another. Wouldn't stick to the work flow and was completely ignoring my bosses instructions. 

My coworker never comes in on time, just rolls in whenever, 1hr late, no fucks given. 


Then.... My coworker made false allegations to HR about me. They were about me bullying him and he was finding it hard to go to work and that's the reason he is late all the time... There was an incident that I don't know about... Turns out it was when I in hospital... That's the only reason I didn't get fired... It couldn't have happened because I was not at work. 


But that was after I was pulled up and slammed by my boss and HR. I was told by HR manager ""nobody likes you, that's why nobody has been dealing with you"". Turns out, there was a group that had formed against me of about 5 people and they got together and made bulk complaints.. Some of the coworkers I've not dealt with or spoken to before. I had said but I don't deal with them and never have so how could I have done anything wrong when it's I've never had contact with them. But like I said, they had said the incident had taken place while I was in hospital. Which meant it they got caught in a massive lie. 


But my boss had pulled me aside and told me that some people had been going home and hurting themselves because of me.... But I didn't know who They were.... My job doesn't require me to talk to people. 

Nothing happened to the people that had made the accusations. 


In the aftermath, I find out that there was a rumor that I was being lined up to be the next manager... Making me the manager of All of them... They had gotten all upset, how dare she, she's not allowed to be My boss. 

Here's the kicker, I'd been offered it 2 times and turned it down, I didn't want to manage them!

Then my annual review, all year exceeding performance levels... Then bomb dropped, my boss told me he had to mark my performance as below minimum because he saw other employee reviews and he didn't want me to be investigated by HR again because I had done well..... WTF? After the hr case was closed and I had been cleared except I wasn't allowed to send emails without being supervised... Yep. Couldn't talk to anyone else without being observed... Which back fired because I was the go to for fixing things and having answers, that stopped super quick and then those same coworkers who told lies were pissed because I wouldn't help them do their job any more. 

NOW, I left that job because it was the worst thing that happened to me. I lost friends because they sided with the lazy coworker and I couldn't put a foot wrong... Walking on egg shells. I was completely broken. I had done some great things and was elite in my career and they broke me and left me without any confidence. I get headhunter by other companies and it was luck and I said yes. 

My new bosses were a bit confused with why I was OK with a big step backwards. But took me on anyway with the understanding that I've come from a bad work situation. 

Ive gone back to the engine room (so to speak) but I have these weird emotional reactions to things I've never had before.

I wanted to start crying because I know I'm technically correct but they don't like the outcome. They weren't mean or anything like that, they're really nice people and we're professional about it. It got as much attention as a lamp in a waiting area. But it's stayed with me for 5hrs I'm at home and still trying not to cry about it. I'm in no way a cryer. I was crying about in my previous job that anyone would. But now I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and Im concerned that I need to be really professional only. I'm a bit scared that  they don't like me enough or maybe I'm too professionally threatening or I don't have a personality or I don't know anything or I'm stupid and all this time I was wrong? Maybe I'm the bad person? Maybe I'm not doing enough work? Maybe I shouldn't have an opinion? I shouldn't pitch ideas? There could be a massive back lash if they don't like what I have to say?
I've never had these thoughts and sometimes I feel like I can breathe or there's a pain in my head that feels like a cramp or lifting something really heavy but I'm sitting. Sometimes my vision goes strange like bright and blurry for a few seconds. And it happens because they ask me to got to lunch or they are questioning my work (normal things)

I also have this panic that hits me as soon as someone asks me something I wasn't expecting, and I'm nonononononononono.

Im finding it hard to stop doing this. I also don't know what is happening to me either. Ive never thought like. This before, it feels crazy similar to going thru puberty and you have such intense feelings that you can't control.

Does anyone know or can help me get back on the work horse?

Or shine some light my way?",1576147771.0

I messaged all of my friends asking them to meet me but then they either ignored me or they were busy and I felt like I had no one. One of my friends said to me they were at work and I said can I quickly come and see you then to talk to you and then she said to me I wish you’d rather not 😂😂. 

The next couple days I’d ask her if we could talk and she just said no and that was it. I then spoke to one of my mates saying I felt alone and that all my mates weren’t there for me and my mates were shit for not looking out for me (the moment was a blur).

Today she said to me that she doesn’t want to be my mate anymore because she can’t speak to me 24/7 to see if I’m ok, because I called her a shit friend and more. I feel like I’m a bad person who thinks he’s doing good but I feel like I’m screwing up my life and I don’t know what to do in my circumstance.

483,Feeling down,"Hi. I'm an 18 year old guy from Ireland. I'm currently in college to become an art teacher and work at the weekends. I feel like I'm not living, like I'm just going through the motions. I feel I have no time but I can't say that because I'm just not using my time well. I'm always tired, never in the mood for anything and just want to go to bed. I feel so isolated because I'm going to college five days a week, getting up early paying €30 for what? To sit alone for hours and count down the minutes til it's somewhat acceptable to go home. It's been a few months now and everyone's formed groups. I feel I'm so far behind both in my work and socially but I don't want to say it to anyone because I don't want to bother them. I think I have social anxiety, I find it so hard to talk to people or ask things in general, but what if I'm wrong and I'm just a lazy cunt. I never have any real time to rest or think between college and work and home. I don't know what to do. I feel there's no one I can talk to, I don't want to worry my friends or family and there isn't really anyone outside of them. I'm literally sitting in a bathroom stall right now so I can be alone. Whys it so hard. Any time I think of doing anything I remember 'I should be working on my project' and can't enjoy myself. I want to read and write but I have to cram them in. We have a counsellor at college but their probably busy helping people with actual problems and this might just be a few bad months. I've barely spoken to anyone I know since leaving secondary school and I'm afraid I'll slowly lose contact with everyone and be alone. I don't want to disappoint my parents but I don't want to feel like this anymore. Originally I was just writing this for myself but I think I'll put it on Reddit and see what people think.",1574943997.0
484,I feel like giving up and life seems pointless,"Hi, I'm a 16 year old guy, in high school, of Asian descent. Let me just give you some context before I tell you what I'm going through. I'm a 4.0+ student in honors/advanced classes who studies without asking for any extra assistance from my parents. I'm on the robotics team, self taught myself how to code, got my black belt recently, and go to the gym. 

My parents yell at me for seemingly no reason. I never yell at them first, never treat them in the way that they treat me. In their eyes, I'm always wrong. In their eyes, I am the root cause of all internal mishaps.

I hate it. For example.

I used to be quite overweight 2 years ago, but then I started running and working out. I lost 30 pounds and gained a lot of muscle. 

I tracked my macros and ate well. I talked to my doctor and I started a body recomp diet.

My parents are vegetarian. As a result, I don't get that much meat. I therefore depend on whey, and oats to reach atleast .8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. 

Yet after being yelled at by them, they tell me that I need to eat ""better..."" White rice and oily veggies are better than a balanced macro spread? 

Both of them are extremely overweight and eat things that no human being should be eating. Yet they tell me, someone who has worked so hard to get to where I am today, someone who cares, what to do?

I can't do this anymore. If you guys have a coping mechanism I'd love to have it. I tend to have a breakdown every other week and can't handle it.",1573878549.0

486,How do you deal with feeling like your always a disappointment and will never amount to anything special,"I’m 16, in high school, and recently I just always seem to feel like a disappointment, and I never seem to have motivation to do anything, even the things I really love. I really love learning, especially maths and I have self studied quite a lot and everyone I know is impressed by me but I always feel like anything I do will never be enough. Because realistically, I won’t ever be special or unique. And I just seem to never want to do anything. I always just want to sit, play games, watch tv and YouTube, and scroll through reddit. And all the time I just think about how I could be special and not mediocre, if only I could manage to care about anything, and I know that it’s just a bit of hard work, but I can just never manage to motivate myself. All my schoolwork is done late, if at all, and I never apply myself at school, because I’ve never had to. I’m still top of the cohort in almost all my subjects but it feels cheated because I don’t try. And then I feel bad. I’m sorry to anyone who has to read this mess but I just wanted to express my feelings to anyone other than a tear soaked pillow. I just want to feel proud of myself,",1573386646.0

489,A Healthy Way to Cope with Suicidal Ideations,"I did something the other day that was very out of my comfort zone: I asked my friends for help.

I've gotten help in the past, but it was somewhat forced. My school forced me into a partial program. The partial program threw me into rehab when my drug test came back positive for Codeine (I had smoked laced weed, this didn't matter). My childhood best friend called my mother when I posted online that I wanted to kill myself and got me hospitalized. The hospital forced me into another month-long partial. It was all helpful, looking at it now, but never once did I get help because I wanted it. And this is why I think I'm still struggling and why it didn't really ""stick."" I wanted to get better but I wasn't committed. I was doing it because I had to. But either way, it taught me skills that I can use now that I am willing to get help, and one of those skills is reaching out to friends when you feel like you need help. It seems so simple yet to some this is so scary. Admitting to a loved one that you are struggling with your mental health is horrifying. You don't want to seem weak to them, or like you can't care for them. You don't know what they'll think really, and your mind runs with endless possibilities of what they might say. But here's the truth, because I did it: If there are people that are still in your life right now that have stayed, and I don't necessarily mean for a certain amount of time but those who have stayed through your toughest of times, I can guarantee you that they want nothing more than to help you heal. And if you ask for help, they will help you.

So I urge you all to text your friends and say something along these lines:

""Hey you, I'm struggling right now and I was wondering if you could maybe write a few words that I could read when I'm feeling really low, something to remind me that I am important and I matter to people because when I am very low, my brain convinces me otherwise and it is very hard to have a conversation with yourself in your head and try to calm yourself down. Sometimes I'm able to do it, but sometimes I need a push. I'm hoping your words can be my push. I am reaching out to you because you mean a lot to me, and I hope you know that. I love you.""

Now, this is simply what I said, but you can rewrite this and use it as a guide. Or if you prefer, and this is exactly what you would say, copy and paste this. But I so strongly urge you to do this. I personally reached out to about 6 of my close friends. 6 people that I trusted so immensely and loved so much that if I read their words they might help pull me out of whatever funk I was in. Text people you trust. Text people you love. Text those you know would want to help. And if you don't have anyone like this in your life and you want to reach out, message me and maybe I can help.

The final step of this coping skill is copying and pasting the responses that you get from these people and compiling a list that I personally call ""proof you deserve to be alive."" Keep this list for the times that you feel alone and need to quickly get pulled out of it, or when you want to reach out to a friend but feel like you'll be a burden. Of course, you won't, but this is a fallback for the times that you don't have the push in you to convince yourself that you're not, in fact, a burden.

This is not for everyone and I am not saying that this is the cure for everyone, but it may help some people and I just wanted to throw it out there. I hope this helps somebody.",1569279350.0

She didn't and the only reason I know it is because I finished a scarf for her baby and asked if I could drop by to give it to her and she sent me a selfie from her new apartment. My problem isn't just that she didn't tell me but the fact that she didn't think I was important enough to tell me. I feel like we grew apart from each other and the baby had a big role in that.

499,I just need help. And I cant find any..,"This is going to be a lengthy post, but I need help. 

As I'm typing this, I'm crying because I feel as though I am becoming more of a waste as time goes on.

It started about 3 and a half - 4 years ago. At first it was a simple divorce of my parents, and I was sad but not depressed, then I met Aleigha. She put me at the peak of my life, and i grew so close with her. Her and i both had some hardships. Her niece of 4 months was murdered, her dad told her mom when she was 2 to say he died in a car accident, and I tried to help her with this. Countless nights staying up on her front porch being a shoulder to cry on for her and I really started falling in love with this girl. It gave me a sense of being valued by someone. We started doing more and being more and I fell in love with that goofy giggle she had and the nights we spent driving around screaming twenty one pilots and panic! At the disco. By this time I'm really starting to set up my life, finally my grades went up, a job, a car, I started to look forward to possibly marrying this girl. This relationship had been going on for about a year and a half. Then I got the phone call. As soon as I answered, i heard it in her voice... i just asked what she did and she said she was sorry.. she had cheated on me. With the person i trusted her most with. I threw my phone out of anger. Luckily not breaking it. Over the next month, we argue daily, and my anger and mixed emotions finally settled. We continue dating. On the condition that she cut him out of her life totally. 

Time passes, about 6 months and I start to leave it behind me. We argue here and there but nothing crazy. Its Christmas time and I get a text from her, a group text. With 3 phony numbers. Hers, mine, and another number....I didnt know at the time, but it was him. She accidentally sent it to us both. But her and I had an arguement because I asked who it was and she snapped, so I left it. Then I started thinking about prom, I'm a senior at this point. She said she didnt want to go but I didnt want to miss my only prom so I went alone with some friends. And when I got home I went to see her but she was asleep already so I went home. Then some stuff happens and it ends with her leaving me. She comes to my apartment and drops off my sweatshirt, but we end up keeping our sweatshirts in memory of eachother. And we got one last hug and I've never cried so hard, I'm bawling at this point in her arms because I dont want her to end it. And she leaves. I had an apartment with my mom at the time and I end up staying in my room for 2 days, and skipping a day at my security job. Now my grades slip, I dont graduate, I left my job and took up a local state program to gain my diploma. I only need 6 credits, but the program ends up being useless. My mom breaks the lease without telling me. Now I'm calling my dad asking to get an apartment together. 

I get an apartment with my dad. I pick up a job as an electrician. Although I am now financially stable, I cant be happy anymore. I cant connect with anyone. I've noticed myself getting more and more angry at little things, it's getting to a point of insanity, I have started having suicidal thoughts. I've talked to my parents and I tried therapy but my parents think I'm fine and the therapist thought I was still upset about the divorce. When I know that it's really Aleigha. I end up finding out the reason she left was because she was dating him. She didnt take me to prom because she went to his.... I'm destroyed, my health is in decline, I'm stuck in a job that will only scrape me by. I have no diploma or GED, I dont have time to get either, I'm getting uncontrollable. I dont feel anymore, Its now been  full year and a few months since she left and I still cant go a single day without thinking about how happy I was. She was perfect. I'm beating myself up and I have no closure and cant talk to her, she thinks I'm some piece of shit now, and I cant do this anymore. I'm at a dead end. Nobody to say goodnight to, nobody to help or talk to, it's all built up and I cant do this anymore. All my friends and parents yell at me when I get angry at little stuff and I just want help. I've pushed everyone away because they tell me I'm stupid for thinking about her but I cant help it. My mind is everywhere and I can't hold still. My nerves had started twitching. I am flinching at small movements on dates and I leave and never talk again. I cant find that connection I had with her. I dont feel anymore. I cant. I'm dying.. I'm 20 years old and I feel as though my life is over already. Everything I wanted is now out of reach....


Edit: I think it's important to mention this if I want help...I have a permit to carry in my state because of a close call I had when I was younger. Well one night at my old security job, it was midnight and I was the only one on property and I almost did it.....i stared down the barrel, but i caught myself.... I locked the slide back, dropped the mag, and pulled the take down pins and separated the slide from the frame. I stopped myself. And I've never told anyone that. Because as much as I know that its dangerous, I also know that I need to protect myself and anyone around me. And that I will never get to choose when or if that happens.",1555299267.0
500,Can't breathe,"I feel like I'm suffocating.

I'm going to their house to take care of my mother as she just had surgery. Have to stay the night, which will be the most time I've spent with them since moving out 9 years ago.

501,Home isn’t home anymore :( TL:DR I get yelled at for breathing basically at home and I don’t like being there.,"I’m a F[17] still in High School so here goes nothing.....
Well for the past couple of years I haven’t been feeling well at home. My mom only really reprimands me and my dad is in prison. She has had two boyfriends ever since she split with my father when I was younger. Though she continues to not hesitate when my younger sibling asks for anything. I always feel scared to go home because of the yelling. My sibling was admitted into the hospital for her depression, but admits it was a show and that she was actually fine and it was something to show my mom that she needed to be watched over more. I of course was blamed for not doing that. Due to that whole situation I got both my parents angry with what happened and I cut off speaking to my father and didn’t speak to him for almost a year. We only spoke because we realized he was finally sentenced and I spoke to him 3 days before he was put in custody. Now my mom has the newest boyfriend who moved us into a home. Might I add my moms new boyfriend is her ex-boyfriend’s nephew, which we met when he had his first child with his first wife. So the whole situation really freaks me out. So now I just sit in my room and wonder if I should just run away or honestly I don’t even know anymore. I really just get anxious and I cry myself to sleep almost every other night. I’m scared every moment of the day that one wrong step and my mom will lose her temper. Thanks for reading about my home life. If you have any advice I’d like to know more.",1554464416.0

506,A drunk driver almost killed my mother and I. I'm alone for the first time in my life.,"I don't drive so my mother has driving me to and from work. She isn't in the best health so she lives with me so I can make sure she has everything she needs. One night my relief was late by two hours because she was busy getting her phone fixed. She didn't even think of a better excuse. On our way home we were stopped in a turning lane waiting for oncoming traffic to ease up so we could turn. Out of nowhere before I could say ""look at this idiot"" a car hit us head on at full speed, spinning us into a guard rail. I remember my moms arm bleeding all over me and her moaning and telling me her arm was broke. Her arm was twisted at an unnatural angle. I was relatively unharmed so I tried to get out only to find that my side of the car was pinned against a guard rail. I climbed over the seats and got out through the trunk. I ran to my moms side of the car and tried to get her out because she was screaming. Her car door was stuck and the console was smashed down on her legs. After they got her out they took us to the hospital. After they saw my mom they took her to a bigger hospital. I spent the night alone in the hospital lobby because no one I knew could take me home. After I made it home I rested for about a week but after I found someone to take me back and forth to work I started going back. I've taken up some more hours and I've been working 80 hours a week to afford some things I need to do to the house to prepare for my mom to come home, like build a wheelchair ramp. I'm only 21 and when I'm not working I'm utterly alone in my home. My SO has been a huge help but him moving in with me isn't feasible at the moment. I've begun talking to my dogs and I'm starting to worry I'll lose my mind and they will start talking back. I feel so helpless and alone.

509,Is my dad weird or is it just me?..,"My dad (58M) and me, (16F) used to be rlly close when I was a baby/toddler... Eventually I noticed I started becoming afraid and uncomfortable around him, especially when we were alone. 

I remember one time when I was probably 7 or 8, my dad said, ""let's go on a daddy-daughter date!"" And I cried and had a breakdown in the closet because I was so scared and didn't wanna go, so I lied and said I was too sick to go.

As I got older, my dad got weirder; he would ask me to ""shake my booty"" as a ""thank you"" gift for him doing nice things for me, which made me really uncomfy but I thought it was normal. I started becoming distant and didn't cuddle him or hang out w him anymore. He scared me especially since he had major anger issues and took it out on my mom and brothers a lot, (he had a horrible childhood) 

I was ""the favorite"" and also the youngest sibling of six.

I remember one time he was joking about my mom being ""an old, used up model"" and he looked at me and said ""you could replace her!"" And it was rlly weird and I was abour 14 at that time.

Same age, I had dressed up in new clothes and I was wearing leggings, heels, a skirt and a top and he looked at me up and down and said, ""how are you hot stuff, you're certainly best dressed"" and I remember saying ""what did you say?!"" And he was like, ""nothing"" 

He also gets mad if any boy shows interest in me or if I show interest in a boy. Not the normal protective dad type, like- screaming yelling type. He freaks out and yells at me and my mom if I go hang out with a boy, saying ""the only men you need are me and your brothers,"" when my brothers were abusive and terrible to me in my childhood and he never gaf. Neither did my mom. 

And he always talks about my face and how beautiful it is and body and how fast I mature and one time he was talking about my boobs in front of MY MOM and siblings.  My mom said in the family group chat, ""she looks like that model but she's got the curves, that model doesn't have curves.""

 and I cut my hair and he said ""you looked better with long hair. I like women with long hair."" And whenever I get my nails done he says ""don't do that I like my women natural."" 

I now get my nails done, almost once a month.

He's the lead pastor of a very popular church and everyone loves him and thinks he's great. I have to shut up and act perfect and act like nothing happens when he says gross things about me being a good replacement for my mom and how hot I am and stuff, and he shames my mom and called her a slimy bitch one time for no reason and used to hit her. Theres so much more I can't even fit in here: he's sexist and raised his son's to be horrible and disgusting, barely gave me an education, over sexualizes me and other women, treats my mom horrible and has hit her before, let's the boys do whatever they want but won't let me go to the movies w a boy, and preaches like he's perfect. There's so much more and I feel so gross and horrible.

512,I have a class with my prejudiced ex's best friend,"When we were together, my ex invited me out to eat at a Waffle House. She picked me up and brought a friend of hers along. I'd met this friend before and felt comfortable around them. After we settled into our booth and ordered food, my ex and her friend started cracking jokes. I contributed to the conversation a little, but mostly listened. It was all harmless at first. Then, completely unprompted and unrelated to previous conversation, my ex tells me that my skin is ""so neon yellow"" that it looked like I had ""jaundice."" Her friend chuckled and, upon seeing the hurt expression on my face, said ""oh, she didn't like that!"" playfully. My ex and her friend are white. I'm half Latina, and I have a tan/olive tone to my skin. It wasn't my first time encountering ethnic discrimination, but to receive it so blatantly from someone I cared about was extremely damaging. But my ex and her friend stared at me a moment expecting me to laugh along. It was a silent encouragement for me to smooth things over for them. They did something wrong, but it was my unspoken duty to make them feel comfortable.  Subtle manipulation like this wasn't new to me either. My ex was very narcissistic and judgmental, but in a way that eased me into submission. I was slowly treated to feel inferior. I grew accustomed to it, and was ultimately brainwashed into accepting it as normal. I played along. I forced a laugh to this racist, sorry excuse of a joke like I was trained to. After I broke up with my ex, I eventually talked to the friend about my experience. They insisted they were too high that night to know what they were doing. I have a class with this person.

I’ve done legitimate IQ tests and even went on to attend a school that required an above average IQ. For anyone familiar with IQ ranges I fall into the very superior range which is 120-140.

Moving on. I find it extremely difficult to communicate with close family members and friends about simple everyday things, and struggle to hold conversation as well. When I refer to the simple everyday things, if I am helping them with a task I expect them to tell me what they need, not for them to expect me to smell it out of thin air, and then with conversations it’s as if it’s nothing but small talk and it never progresses.

Then on the other hand, I hardly ever encounter this problem when interacting with strangers. It’s so bizarre and inexplicable from my point of view.

517,Help me cope with my suicide attempt failing?,"On Sunday night I got really drunk and ran into traffic trying to get hit. I did not get hit and was instead taken to a hospital where they kept me until I sobered up and a psych doctor determined I was no longer a danger to myself (so basically just over night). I took Monday off work because they (work, not the hospital) insisted but then I was right back at it... 

... and my job is a lot of why I wanted to kill myself in the first place- I work at a very understaffed fast food restaurant where I routinely preform 2 positions at once all while experiencing verbal and sometimes physical attacks from strangers. They recently increased my hours from part time to full time without asking or even warning me despite the fact I suffer from numerous health conditions including gastroparesis and severe bipolar disorder that only *partially* responds to medication and *can't* work full time, as I've explained to management not once, or twice, or even thrice! but *four times*. So many times there isn't even a cute little word for how many times anymore. 

I'm stuck at this job because I was too fucking stupid to graduate high school (I didn't drop out, I went until the very last day of senior year, I just couldn't pass any of my classes except for english and psych because I'm a worthless sack of trash) and nowhere else hires without a diploma. 

I study for my GED every single day but on account of the aforementioned worthlessness I haven't made any tangible progress. I've been studying for it since I failed out 5 years ago and I still don't have it. 

Other factors include that I'm absolutely in love with a fwb who just wants to be friends for extremely valid reasons, reasons anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together would share, and I'm constantly upset about how I'm never going to have a romantic partner. 

I don't have any friends besides this fwb (because nobody will spend time with me unless I have sex with them) which also contributed to my attempt. 

My gastroparesis also played a big role in my attempt. I am just tired of living in a body that doesn't work. 

I still have all of these problems plus new ones including that I got kicked out in the aftermath of my attempt and now no longer get to live with my cat, who is the closest thing I've had to a friend, and that at one point during my hospital stay my clothes were forcibly removed which triggered memories of my sexual assault at age 14 (it took place in a hospital setting as well) that I had only very recently began to heal from. I am now having flashbacks everyday again, as well as flashbacks to the event that triggered the memories itself.

My mom has been battling a serious form of breast cancer for the last 4 years and in the last two months shes been quite weak. Turns out, as we found out about two weeks ago, there’s a tumor in her brain. The first symptom she noticed was losing feeling in her fingers, then not being able to move her left leg. 

More an more things have been failing, and fast. I was on a FaceTime call with her the other day and she seemed the weakest she’s ever been, and can’t see out of one eye. Both of my parents have told me that it’s really my choice when I fly over to see her, or if I do it all. 

I don’t know how I’m supposed to see her at this point. I know I’m going to hate it.

520,A couple of days ago I was on the verge of suicide,"Hello everyone, friends! My name is Alexander, I am 29 years old, I am a dental technician from Russia. I live in the south of Russia, in the city of Krasnodar, it is not far from the Black and Azov seas, as well as from the war zone in Ukraine. Initially, I graduated as an architect at the university, tried many professions in search of myself. He even worked at a construction site and learned how to build wooden houses there. I tried to create a business with the money saved up after the wedding, but I failed. After that, I joined the family business, my mother works as a dental technician and I began to help her, my abilities opened up to this, I began to work for other people, gradually increasing my skills and experience, simultaneously receiving a second college education. I have worked very hard and hard to improve my life. Having once been abroad in Spain, I fell in love with this country. Everything was so unusual, streets, houses, people, their way of life and their vision of the world. Having been there, I realized that I wanted to visit other countries and started earning and spending all the money on travel. I have visited Italy, Greece, Turkey. I talked to all these interesting people and realized that I don't want to live in Russia anymore. I started working to get the opportunity to earn remotely, mastered the modeling of teeth on a computer and even began to take orders over the Internet. I was saving money and came under the influence of friends who discovered trading on the stock exchange. Driven by a dream, I invested everything I had and I began to succeed. I started making money trading securities, I saw this as a chance to become free, travel the world and decided that I could do it! I borrowed money from my family, then took out a loan in the amount of 15,000 dollars. And now I'm already buying a ticket to visit Egypt with my wife, when suddenly this conflict in Ukraine. God, this has become a nightmare. All my securities trading, including. arginal trading, I took risks and always felt the market, but it was like a bolt from the blue. I was sitting on the shore of the red sea, but I saw nothing but the loss of my money on the stock exchange. Putin's speech with the recognition of the independence of the republics and I lost a quarter of the portfolio in a brokerage account, hastily selling assets so as not to catch a margin call. It was terrible for me, I remembered that I have a heart, as I was close to a heart attack. But it didn't end there, the subsequent military operation announced by the President of the Russian Federation at the moment collapsed the market lower than ever in the last 10 years. I frantically sold everything I could, trying to avoid margin calls, but he caught up with me. I've lost everything. Everything I had. All that I took on credit and in debt. I have lost the instrument of my earnings. I lost 20,000 dollars. for me, this is just a huge amount, since working with my hands I earned about 40-50 dollars a day. And now I'll have to give it all away, but how?! At the moment when I returned home and looked at the phone screen, where the brokerage application showed me that now I had nothing left, I was overtaken by horror. I felt doomed. I understood that somewhere not so far from me people were dying, houses were being destroyed. But my own world was destroyed. It was destroyed by the anger and division of other people. Someone there in the big offices decided to play war, to measure the size of nuclear members, and for some reason I suffer from this. My life was destroyed by their conflicts. they will pay almost nothing for their actions. And if you think that I want to ask you for money, then you are wrong, I want and can earn it! I am a man, I am the head of my family. I know how to make beautiful and functionally correct teeth, I model on a computer in the exocad program. And I'm asking for your help. Reddit is a huge English-speaking community, and I am sure that you can somehow help me find an employer remotely so that I can earn a living and service my debt. I am really a very diligent and hardworking person, and I always do it conscientiously and in full force. I make every effort to make my work the closest to the ideal. And I hope for your help. I need a job, and I won't let you down. A few days ago I was standing at the edge of the abyss. I was on the verge of suicide. But now I want to turn the situation around, prove to myself and everyone around me what I am capable of. I deserve a responsible and well-paid job! I want to work with Western countries so that I can move to one of them later, because I don't like everything I see in Russia right now.

Thinking back, it seemed like she was never happy and every few years would be trying to find a reason, any reason at all to leave the relationship. The sex was always great, but it seemed as if she associated a satisfied partner with them wanting sex, she never seen the bigger picture. The older we got and more we got, it just seemed like she was never happy for long and always thought things should be different/better than what they were and that I began to pay less attention to her. She never really told me much about her childhood or teenage years or her transition to America at a young age as she was from Guatemala, but what I was told seemed normal. Throughout the marriage, I never really suspected her of cheating but there were a few events that raised red flags but for the most part I never had a reason to question her or suspect anything because her answers and stories always seemed legitamate or checked out. After almost 8 years of trying we had a baby. We had seperated and had still been doing it like crazy, so when she told me after 2 months of seperation, I never suspected a thing and welcomed her back. Things were great, especially that first year the baby was born, then things began to transition back to the way things once were, only this time I began to have substance abuse issues stemming from a bad accident before the baby was born. We grew further apart and she was on her phone all the time so we sought counseling. Counseling was helping but apparently not enough as one day things reached a point to where the marriage broke down and we seperated. From here things got worse and worse and I discovered that she had possibly been cheating. I confronted her, she denied the evidence, I took her phone and the next day both of our phones were hacked and things deleted and added. I was confused at this point, who would do this and why, what on the phones was so important? What I found on her phone blew my mind....10 different social media and communication apps, some with duplicate accounts that I was not aware of, but mainly snapchat, facebook, and whatsapp was used. She had numbers hid under all kinds of contacts, tons of pictures (not xxx) that I had never seen of her and places and all kinds of questionable dating websites and accounts. Everytime I would find something my phone would be hacked and the info deleted so eventually I reported it to the authorities, which nothting ever came of that. I knew something wasn't right even though she denies everything, so i kept digging and discovered she had a special operating system on her phone with customized websites, apps, links associated with people and various ways of opening all of this information. It was like 2 phones in one, but you had to know how to access the hidden part. I did a generic search one day, ""cheating wife"" and just clicked on the images by accident. When I did I seen a viral social media article from a few years ago about a pregnant cheating wife at a football game, pregnant with her husband who was texting another man the whole game. I looked at the picture and immediately recognized it as my wife. The hair, her hands, the phone....it was her and at that time she was supposed to be at a funeral. I dug deeper on reddit, social media, porn sites and discovered tons and tons of videos, accounts, and pictures of her only she had tried to disguise them and hide her face in them but i recognized other things in the videos that left no doubt it was her. I now have evidence and she completely denies everything, which I havent played all my cards and let her know everything that I know. But we are going through a divorce and she is trying her best to make it look like I am the one that was cheating when I was nothing but faithful our entire marriage. Theres alot more to the story but she has begun to try and delete all of the evidence or have it removed from the internet and is trying to make it look life I am losing my mind and going crazy. She literally is the best liar and manipulator I have ever met in my life and I'm not even sure if our child is mine anymore due to her sleeping with hundreds and hundreds of not only men but women and couples. For my safety, I am not able to discuss the rest at this point, but I was never supposed to find what I have found and apparently its alot bigger than I ever imagined. Her videos and pics are all over the internet, but the software on her phone has infected and restricted my devices, downloads, searches, and most evidence I have found. At this point, I just am afraid for our child and want my wife held accountable for her actions that she has profited off of for what looks like the past 20 years. I'm not worried about money, I just want the truth to come out. How did I never see it? I've asked myself the same question over and over and its because she never game me a reason not to trust her, she was always there for the most part and due to the technology/software that was installed on her phone. I'm leaving out alot, but it's just too much for one post. Please help!",1637471849.0
524,I’m deathly afraid of needles.,"I have my covid vaccine on Saturday, but I don’t think I will physically be able to do it because I might faint.

“Oh, well, I’ve had worse”
Or
“People with ___ have to get injections every day”

529,The Bottom,"When I was accepted into Millsaps College last fall and they gave me a Scholarship, they told me that it covered my tuition for four years. 

However, what they didn’t tell me was that when it came to housing and meals (things that I had no choice in), I would be on my own to pay for such. Together, it was a little under 7,000.

I had been saving up money and paying it off for the last three months. However, my mother’s heart attack followed by her subsequent illness made saving money impossible. Millsaps asked that students who weren’t able to pay it all upfront enroll in a payment plan. I did, however, that plan was suspended due to it not being a large enough balance to cover what I owe. 

So, in order to be able to move on campus and get my books, I had to pay nearly two thousand dollars on another plan up front. That left me flat broke. Currently, I only have 98 dollars to my name.

To add insult to injury, Millsaps neglected to tell me that the balanced I needed to pay was due by the end of October as another balance would be created for the Spring semester. I was told that if it wasn’t paid by then, then I wouldn’t be allowed to renew my registration as a student (I’d be kicked out of school). And when I asked about anything I could do, I was essentially told

“Take out a loan”

As my only option.

The new payment plan has taken everything I had saved up in my bank account. In a bid of desperation, and in need of money to help my sick mother pay bills, I spent this afternoon whoring myself out to several different sugar mommies and daddies, only to be met with scam after scam. When that didn’t pan out...

I sold some of my nudes...

I don’t know if anyone’s ever sold themselves before... but it feels gross... No, gross is not the word.

When he asked how much and I told him... in that moment, I understood how it felt to be scum. How to felt to be the lowest of the low, the bottom of the heap. I was the desperate loser with the sick mom and college debt pawning off himself to the highest bidder like a common hooker.

Growing up in poverty, you get used to the feeling of not having. You grow accustomed to it. Learn to ignore the pain it brings. But when you’re given the chance to escape that life... and the only thing stopping you is not having enough, the pain is one much deeper, much more visceral. When you experience that pain for the first time, you realize...

There is no escape from the bottom.

You will always be scum.",1628915458.0
530,I hate everything on this planet except for art,"I’m a first year out of high school, and studying in a fashion design career, which I feel like I’m waisting my student loan I was given as I have no passion or not enough passion to successfully pass. After high school I realised how cold the world really is, and I started my own art business online which was unsuccessful at first, so I decided to delete that Instagram account where I posted my artworks of realism portraits, but I never quit drawing and making artworks. I am starting to see how much I’ve improved in my art, and I feel like it is the only thing keeping me sane on this planet. I want to continue my fashion design course because it will be a big pay out if I’m successful but it is also driving me to complete insanity as my passion is just not enough. But I feel if I throw this opportunity away I’m throwing my life away. Could someone please help I don’t know what to do. It’s like I’m contemplating making a life threatening decision and I can’t trust anyone either because they showed me their true colours after I finished high school.",1627570709.0
531,The final slap in the face," My birthday was yesterday, the 20th. This is not a post fishing for karma or birthday wishes, but something happened and I, in usual fashion, need to scream it out into the void and maybe gather some opinions on the way.

I had rented an Airbnb for Friday night, since one of the friends I had invited to come (it was me, my Boyfriend, a male and a female friend of mine) had to work on Sunday.  
All was well (well, not really, you could look in my post history to see what I mean but it's not all that relevant), my two friends arrived at the airbnb before my BF and I did, we all got together in the afternoon.

I seriously don't know how it was exactly said (I have the inkling my brain blends these moments out as a means of self-preservation) but it started with her asking 'oh, so we're staying over night?' when someone said something about what we were going to be doing later. I noticed this but decided to ignore it, though my stomach dropped in that moment.

In my opinion, and knowing her, she was well aware that we were supposed to be staying the night.  
WHY WOULD I RENT AN APARTMENT IF NOT?

Anyway, after that little comment things went along normally, when we were walking around outside her boyfriend called. That's when, and again I don't know how it was originally said, she stated that she would be picked up by him tonight.

Honestly, I know I'm dramatic, but it felt like someone pushed a dagger through my heart.

My BF looked at me all confused, I felt such shame being 'stood up' on my fucking birthday by one of my best friends... I literally drove 5 HOURS by train to get to her when it was her birthday this year. 5 fucking hours.

What's even more ironic about the whole thing is that, in the past, we had huge issues regarding the fact that I was supposedly 'leaving her hanging' for my boyfriend at the time, simply because I would, after we all hung out together, sleep over at his place and not hers. We literally hung out for hours but that simple fact was enough for her to denounce me and call me every name under the sun it felt like - she berated me for 'being meek' and ' subjugating' myself to him, she would tell me I was a dumbass for letting him tell me what to do - and now, she's literally changed her entire life for this guy, rarely sees her friends anymore and, well....leaves them hanging on their birthdays.  
I would have NEVER, not in a million fucking years and not during the worst abusive realtionships of my life have done that. NEVER.

Anyway, I didn't know what to say in that moment honestly, so I just ignored it. This is usually my mode when I'm seriously hurt but don't want to acknowledge it because of shame - I pretend like everything's fine.

When she packed her things up, when she went to the bathroom for 30mins to 'freshen up', when she was picked up at not even midnight even though she had previously said it was going to be later - I just didn't say anything and sat there with a pit in my stomach.

I paid 100 bucks for this apartment, we were supposed to be splitting the cost. We were supposed to be having fun, she had texted me THE DAY BEFORE how excited she was for the event, how we were going to 'have a great night'. (she texted me, after rarely speaking to me at all, simply because she had a fight with her BF and I'm the one to soothe her when things go wrong. every. fucking. time.)

And then she just left.

Didn't even say 'hey I'm so sorry but I really need to go' or 'hey I know this sucks, let's celebrate some other time' (which wouldn't have made it much better but anyway). She literally just left, without feeling sorry or even just realising that what she was doing was just...horrible.

It put a damper on that entire night, even though I did have a good time with my Boyfriend and other friend. I just felt so ridiculous. To have rented this apartment, to have assumed that ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS FOR YEARS would be excited to celebrate with me, to have gotten my hopes up that it would be a fun night.

I haven't opened her birthday wish, I don't know what to do now.  
I don't think we could recover from this, I don't know if I would want to.

I've literally been doing EVERYTHING for this girl ever since I've known her, I've put myself in uncomfortable situations, situations in which I was sexually assaulted (because she went off to fuck some other guy and left me with strangers) for her, I've travelled 5+ hours just to be there for her for HER birthday, I threatened to beat people up for her back in the day, I've spent HOURS on the phone with her, listening to her talk about the same fucking problems she has over and over and over again.

I've literally done everything for this girl and she couldn't even extend the courtesy to spend my 20th birthday with me, as was planned.

This was a long rant, I could go on but I'm just emotionally spent at this point.

I'm used to being used, in a sense, but this really takes the cake. If you're a nurturing person, you're going to get taken advantage of BIG TIME. If you actually have a heart of gold, people are going to stomp on it so long until you finally give up and give in and lay everything to rest. All the nice things you do for people, all the patience and warmth you have for them - it all gets corrupted by the sheer lack of care 9,5 out of 10 people extend their fellow humans.

I'm done.

I'm done being nice, I'm done caring about others to the extent that I do.  
This broke me.

It really did.",1627277691.0
532,Why do I feel like two different people?,"Hey Reddit. 18(f) here. Going through a breakup, family stress, a two car accidents, and a whole lot of other BS rn. Needless to say, this last month has been the worst month of my life.

When I wake up in the morning, I feel depressed. I get hit with the realization that the partner that just dumped absolutely betrayed me. I feel lonely. I feel like I’m not good enough. I caught up with a friend yesterday and she told me all about how happy she is and all the things she’s doing for herself. I look at myself and think “How is she happy?” Like, yeah, I go to the gym, I play video games, etc. But I just feel like a shell. I’m just doing these things because I know I should... I’m not actually happy or living in the moment at all.

This compounds in the AM. Besides feeling useless and unlovable, I feel like everyone else is actually happy and living their lives (sure, they have their problems too, but for the most part they’re happy!) but for me, I’m just here. Going through another day, I’d rather sleep all day or be on my phone.


For some reason, right when it gets dark outside, every. single. day. without miss. I get motivated. Suddenly, this is when I deep clean my room, this is when I feel like doing something with my life, but most importantly it’s at 3AM that I have little peptalks with myself and really don’t care what anyone else thinks about me. I’m happy. It’s my world, you’re just living it it kind of feeling. I then thank God I snapped out of the random depression burst and plan all of the fun things I’m going to do tomorrow.... only to wake up and have the cycle repeat itself. I wake up and think “Yeah, that’s not happening.” and go through this all over again.


This has been like this (noticeably) for months. But has probably been going on for years before I noticed it and started to identify that this is something I can’t control and that I think I have a problem.

Does anyone out there know what this is? I know a lot of you will probably say depression, but I don’t know. I can look into it. I’m not completely closed off to accepting it’s a neurological kind of depression, but it just doesn’t make sense to me. I was always irritated by those friends that were depressed because I was such a polar opposite. 

Anyway. Does anyone know what this is or how I can get help?

Edit: It’s like reverse sun-downing :\",1625164727.0
533,Am I Still To Blame?,"NSFW
•
•
I have always been a sexual kid. I was alone a lot in my room in early childhood with free reign of the internet, so my introduction to pornographic material was really early on in my life, say nine or ten years old. (My therapist says my mother is borderline neglectful, if that makes any difference). I am now 18, so roughly double my life since then, and the shit I did back then makes me have panic attacks today. I touched my 3 year old cousin when I was 9 or 10 for about a year (we’d see them monthly). Looking back on it now, I feel like I understood that behavior was wrong, but not entirely comprehended *why* maybe?
My life flipped upside down when I was 12, and I found God which honestly have me a massive moral compass boost, and since then I have been horrified, and feel nauseous, whenever I think about what I did.

Should I still be held accountable? Is it my fault? That is only one of many sexual things I did as a child, though this was by far the worst. I just want to know if it was truly my fault.  Please help me cope with these feelings.",1624344711.0
534,I at least want to talk to someone,"I don't know what to do

My Brother and I just fought for the 4th time and I don't know what to do

I know what you're thinking

Siblings fight are normal

I know there normal but I'm just sad and helpless

My parents are separated/divorced

Im currently living with my father but my father is at singapore

And me and my siblings which is the 3 of is are at philippines

We have a good life

My dad sends us money and stuff, my sister is here 

But there is only 1 problem

My brother constantly beat me up

A 15 year old 80KG guy vs a 12 year old 45 KG guy getting beaten up, getting stomped at the stomach constantly is just not normal for me 

We just got into a fight were basically I woke him uo constantly because he keeps on snoring to the point were he would just beat me up

Well If I was him I would get angry but not to the point werr I would fight physically and ruthlessly beating up a 12 year old continuously 

I search up on the Internet on how to stop snoring so that he could just stop 

And when I told him on how to stop snoring 

He said that I talk too much and just beat me up again 

I of course will not fight back because I know it's wrong to physically fight someone who's older than you

I always told him that everytime we fight I would post him on the Internet I told him that 100 times but of course I wouldn't do it 

but he reached the point were I couldn't handle it anymore

He told me to shut up everytime I talk quietly and nicely because by the look of his face when he looked at me

he wanted to kill me, he's teeth was grinding, breathing heavily, tears running down his eyes 

But I don't understand why would he cry 

shouldn't I be the one crying? 

He's the one who beat me up and use my metal bottle then threw it at me

I tried cooling down the situation by talking nicely because I also got angry that he hurt me 

But I accept that because he's older than me

i know that it's normal for siblings to fight but... I just can't handle it anymore 

I also remember were he stomp my stomach constantly were I was gasping for breath 

But of course I did not fight back but just record 

Now I want to speak up because I don't want to be beaten up continuesly 

I wish I could just rest in peace for all these to end 

A 12 year old getting ruthlessly beaten up by a 15 year old who's 80 kg is just to much 

I of course again know that it's normal to fight as siblings 

But no one is here to help me

540,Guyz i need advice,"I am a junior in highschool. Its a new school. I had spent the 11 years of my life in the previous school and i had two best friends. I could never share anything with them but we spent good times together and they were the only source of my happiness. My father is a narcissist. He never treated any sibling fairly. He always loved the sibling who was good in studies. He always downgraded me for being poor in studies. I always had maladaptive daydreaming but i never told anyone and its hard for me to focus with studies but somehow in my freshman and sophomore year of highschool I studied really hard just because i was so fed up of hearing all that. I topped both of my siblings and got really good grades. He then started loving me the most and expects a lot from me now to fulfil his dreams of seeing one of the siblings become something he wanted since my other siblings failed his expectations. My sister is always rude to me and never understands a thing. My brother is a psychopath who mentally tortured me whole life. Everyone knows me in school like a funny person cuz i always made jokes and got made fun of. But i used to use school as an escaping place to relax from home. In my after classes, i made two friends. They were really nice and shared their little problems with me and i sorted them out. I really got close to them in a short time because i had never made friends in a long time and i only had my two childhood best friends before. But when i felt i dont want to hide my sadness from them, i started sitting quite. When they didnt find the entertaining me, they ignored me and always just used me when needed. After my sophomore year exams, one of them called me and broke my heart by saying something. I decided never to call her again cuz i was the only one who used to call her cuz she never did. It was the march of previous year when corona started. I cried many nights cuz i couldnt resist to call her cuz i just wanted to talk to someone. Its march now too and this whole previous year, i had suffered like two of them died. I couldnt resist to talk to them and it almost felt like i have lost someone, the exact pain. Its somehow better now but i still care about them both. Corona lockdown made me really depressed. My childhood best friends were really busy in some course or something, they barely talked to me. I got food addiction, depression, anhedonia and used to spend time watching funny things on YouTube to pass my time. Whenever i tried to leave my phone, i felt so empty and hopeless. Junior year started in october. I didnt study at beginning uptil now cuz i am depressed and daydream a lot. My daydreams were never this excessive but they are really much now. The friends who dumped me went to the same school as me. I never listened to lectures in school cuz all i was thinking about was to pass by them and see them while walking by at hometime. I wanted themto talk to me. I was not able to make new friends in new school cuz i have trust issues now. I didnt take any online class. I was never this vulnerable. I just cannot study. I am depressed, anhedonic, have maladaptive daydreaming,food addiction, gained 8 kg in 5 months, have the pressure of my fathers expectations, a pychopathic brother and a really bad environment at home which i cannot leave. At the point, its only 3 months left for exams and i dont even know a word. Whenever i open book, i get depressed and go into daydreaming. I have started being so ill like having flu, headache. How do i study? It's really important for me. I cannot afford to waste a year of my life and cant face the wrath of my father. I want to escape this household as soon as possible. I only have three months. Each science book contains 300 pages. I have english and two other subjects too. How do i study?",1614947132.0

547,My friend is hung up on my girlfriend and keeps telling me how he'd feel much better if he was with her. HELP!,"Last night, my gf messaged him because she hadn't talked to him in months. I talked to him to, for the same reason.

He knows I'm with her, but he keeps saying how much he likes her and shit like ""That’s true, but when I prefer the idea of settling down and having kids with [my gf] than my own girlfriend, then I’m not so sure 😂"" and ""No, she’s a really nice person. But after last night for some reason I like [my gf] more than I like [his ex crush] now. If feels like if I were with [my gf], I’d be able to let [his ex crush] go in that way where as with [his gf] I wouldn’t be able to""

It's driving me crazy! And it doesn't help that he's taking my girlfriend out to dinner as friends (she told him it's only as friends), which I was fine with until he said it was scheduled for next month. We all know February is the month of Valentine's Day, and we will still be in lockdown during that month, AND she's still at Uni in another county...I have to wait to see her at the end of lockdown, so it hurts that she's coming back from Uni during lockdown to see him and yet I still have to wait to see her.

It also doesn't help that I know what he did to his ex crush. He admitted everything to me! That when he would hug his ex crush, he would get an erection and pull his ex crush closer, and his ex crush even told me that he would force hugs when his ex crush didn't want to hug. Wtf do I do?!

Update: Turns out my gf wasn't cheating, she's just a narcissist!! I asked her, and she wouldn't give me a straight answer without being nasty to me. She fucked with my head, so I ended up asking my friend if anything is going on. He denied everything. I was still skeptical, because of how she'd been acting. I broke up with her after 3 days of abusd, and the amount of manipulation and abuse I had to suffer through that was immense!! (Longer story in other posts about this). She says she did nothing wrong and it's all my fault! Using my mental health as an excuse for everything she did (my mental health issue is a mix of depression and schizophrenia. I can't remember the name of it, it was very long and a lot to take in XD)",1610891335.0
548,This is my first mistake in my life and i don't know what to do next," 
Last year, in highschool while i was a senior (i was 17 at the time). these two girls approched me and it came to a point when we made out (one was 15 the other was 14). At this time i didn't know, but when i found out i told them that i can't be doing this and cut them off l. The girls got in trouble for something and went away for awhile. When they came back one of the girls (the 15 year old) came to me and i basically made out with her. Instead of putting my foot down and saying no. I was too weak will at the time to tell her know, so i found out that she would be leaving the school. I let her make out with me and after that i never saw her again. The entire time i felt uncomfortable but i went along with because, im a people pleaser and she was really into me. I looked up the laws and i fall under the protections where i live. The question i want to ask is am i wrong for trying to put this all in the past and forget about it. I already know im wrong for allow it to happen and being to weak willed to say no. Im pretty sure she moved on cause i never got a text back from her. its been a year since it happened and I just want to know if it is ok for me to move on.

P.S. thinking back alittle harder. They had approch me first and initiated the incounter. But i still should have put my foot down and said no when she came back",1608748006.0
549,"I can’t feel, but I keep crying.","Hi there. So, I made a post here before in late November talking about how my dad was dying and my life was going to be a mess. Well, I was right. In a different way. My dad took his final breaths two days before Thanksgiving, which sucks because he loves my mom’s Thanksgiving food. Its going to be a decently long story so get ready, I guess. A week and two days before Thanksgiving (I can’t think of the actual date right now), my dad had a seizure and went into cardiac arrest while at work (a construction site). He died. Luckily, my second oldest brother was there and was able to do CPR and call an ambulance as everyone else watched in shock. Because my brother kept him alive, the doctors were able to revive him. My mom woke me and my third oldest brother up (I’m the youngest), crying. We went to the hospital. We were informed that due to COVID-19, only one person could see him for 4 hours a day. My mom took every day besides one when my oldest brother (who moved states away as he didn’t know if people would accept him as a FtM). A week later from my dad’s seizure, everyone got to see him. I mean everyone as my mom and siblings. His friends, siblings, nephews, nieces, and mother was there. They couldn’t see him one more time. Which is sad because none of them had seen him for a year or so. Me, my siblings, and my mom just spent the last days the oldest sibling was there together. I was just sad for about two weeks, just sad. Nothing else but sad. Then my partner, Cosmo, whose dead name is Naomi (they’re non-binary), have decided that they no longer liked females. We’ve been dating for two years and we’re one of the last things keeping me alive and they tell me that they no longer like girls. I was sad and confused for a few hours. They asked to still be my friend. This was while I was doing online school, too, so I couldn’t focus. Two hours later, I said “fuck it”. I stopped caring. Every emotion just disappeared. I decided to keep being their friend because I didn’t have any before. When I wasn’t thinking about my dad, I was happy. I was happy I wasn’t with Cosmo anymore. I didn’t have to worry about breaking up with me for the 4th time because they just did it! They broke up with me 3 times before. Once because they were homophobic, another because they were scared about their mom finding out, another because they didn’t love me “anymore”. Everything was good as I no longer had to worry about them. I still love them, but part of me absolutely DESPISES them. They broke up with me 4 times, they broke up with me just after my dad died, they broke up with me because they didn’t like my gender, and they had the audacity to ask to still be best friends? Most of me ignores that. Most of me doesn’t want to lose the last person that makes me happy, even if they held me bad so much for so long. Only a few days past until I stopped feeling again. But when I see anything that reminds me of my dad, tears comes out my eyes. I didn’t feel sad, I felt empty?? I’ve been like this before when I moved from the place I mainly grew up in, which made me lose all my friends (which was a lot). I don’t know why I’m not feeling and why I’m crying without being sad. I don’t know what to do with my life now. I’m confused. I’m only a 13-year-old girl who’s obsessed with the most stupid things, watches the same shows over and over, and who can’t think properly unless they’re pacing with music playing. I’m not sure why I wrote all of this. Maybe it’s because I want to be told that everything is going to be okay, or to be told how to cope. Sorry if I wasted your time. I didn’t even tell half of everything, but I tried to shorten everything as much as possible. Have a good day, be safe, and as always, peace out.",1608088128.0

555,How do I forgive myself?,"I know this isn't nearly as awful as what other people are dealing with, but I need advice. Several years back I wasn't educated on how to be a good pet owner. My parents were awful with pets and often abusive. I never abused my pets, but I didnt understand that they were a lifetime commitment. 
   I had taken one dog I owned to the shelter for aggression without really thinking about the consequences of what may happen to her. 
A year or two later I had 3 cats. They were wonderful and I adored them all. But i lost my job and was struggling to pay my bills and feed myself and the cats. I tried to rehome them. When that failed i tried some local rescues who wouldn't take them due to a lack of space. I felt awful that they werent getting fed or cared for properly, and decided to take them to a no kill shelter near by.
    It has haunted me for years, and for some reason it has been heavy on my mind and heart lately. I would give anything to go back and fight harder to do better for them. Ive learned alot since then about what it means to take in and love a pet. Never giving up on them and fighting for them. I have a couple now that I will never ever abandon.

Any topic is welcome (this includes suicide, depression, divorce, death of a loved one, health disorders, transgenderism, coming out stories, mental disorders, terminal diseases, addiction, bullying, child abandonment, infertility, etc). 

This project has the purpose to help anyone else who is going through the same thing you did.

I won't give my approximate age but I'm in my late teens, though you could've gathered that latter on. So, for the past few years I've felt morally out of place in my family, though I feel like that's normal for most teens. I have the complete opposite view points on life as they do. They are all Christians, conservatives, homophobes, and Racist. Me, I just want to speak good of others and help make the most of everyone's life. Though my family is like this, it doesn't make me love them any less it just makes me have severe anxiety about the future.

My mother seems to expect perfection out of me and if not that then she's constantly finding ways that I could've been better. A few months ago she said that I was worthless and never did anything for her or the family (even though I just just helped her remodel the entire house.) Things like that really bother me and maybe they shouldn't, I guess just another one of my inadequacies. A few days ago I got my AP test scores back, I failed both of them, I didn't really want to tell her because I knew she would make me feel bad about in some way whether it was unintentional or not. A few hours ago we were talking about my failed attempt as band section leader and she asked about the AP scores, I told her, she proceeded to correct my every mistake. She told me that I shouldn't pursue my passions in leadership if I couldn't convey things through writing and that maybe its a good that I didn't get section leader so I could focus more on school. I just want to be my best and no I don't think I should be perfect or live up to other peoples standards but its hard not to try.

I have physical symptoms because of it, my airways sometimes close when I have a panic attack. I get angry at everything scared it's going to hurt me. I carry a burden of PTSD when it comes to relationships. I've been lied to, cheated because I'm too much to handle. I feel fucking hopeless and my Autism holds me back from opening up and my anxiety is just the extra whisper to make it hold me down even more.

577,I think porn is ruining my sexual relationship,"I’ve been in a relationship with someone I’m very close to and love a lot, for over half a year now. I’ve always watched porn from time to time since puberty hit. Never thought much about it and didn’t see it as an issue. I’ve had times where I watched more porn and masturbated more when I was feeling more depressed than usual.
In The first months of our relationship I never watched porn really in that time I didn’t like anything on there and got a bad feeling of the people in the video that they didn’t actually want to have sex and stuff like that, so i just didn’t watch. 
Somewhere here though i dreamt twice in a week about having sex with a man. We never actually had sex but we had a sexual and intimate sort of connection i dont want to get in to details.

These dreams really weirded me out and made me think about why I was so horny in the dream. And why I couldn’t stop thinking about it when i had woken up. It made me feel bad since I have a girlfriend and I usually don’t feel attracted to men. I think those dreams made me want to watch porn. And porn made me want to feel how it is to have sex with a man (?). And the hardest part is that sometimes when we have sex, and I have taken too long to orgasm or just feel a bit less aroused. I think about a man having sex with me instead and sometimes it works with the arousal.

I hate hate hate this and I still watch porn sometimes when Im alone and afterwards i regret it so much because i’m afraid i’m going to start feeling unsatisfied with having sex with my girlfriend.

I love her and she makes me very horny and makes me feel good. So it isnt always like this. But sometimes it scares me that I think about someone else having sex with me when I’m with her. Not always. And usually I only think about her. But sometimes this happens and i think it’s because of porn.

578,Is this depression or just a bad day?,"I am 17 going onto 18 this year. In all my years of living I have never had a worse day that I can remember in my whole entire life. I’m in my last year of high school. School just started this week today being the second day of it. This may just be the worst day I’ve ever experienced in my whole life that I can remember up to this point and I’ve had a lot of bad days.

It started of with me going to school. My vibe was just not there today and I could feel my bad vibe no matter how much try to cover it up by talking positively, as everyone I talked to today either ignored me every time I tried to begin a conversation or the conversation ended on a really bad note. I also experience an extreme lack of motivation to complete any school work as I was overwhelmed by the work load of our final year. And so the day continued and everything that came out of my mouth would just turn to shit. It was just after lunchtime 2hrs before school finished, I began to feel pretty sad and I wanted to tell someone what was going on but at the same time I lacked the motivation to do so. I just really wanted to go home and not talk to anyone.

When I got home I thought all that uncomfortable stress and pain would go away as it usually does when I’m having a bad day, I heal myself with cold water. But this did not, it lasted throughout the whole day. I had no motivation to talk to anyone in my family , or complete homework task. I ended up taking a nap and it was still there. When I woke up I was listening to some chill/sad music and ended up crying. And I never usually cry. At the end of the day I worked out for 2hrs, 1hr longer than my usual workout because I was in so much sadness I didn’t know what to do. I just finished the workout and I sort of feel relaxed but worried. At this moment I have no clue what is going on whether it was a bad day or a sign of depression.

581,I was too affective with a good friend of minen - who I fell in love with - and I am ashamed of myself.,"Sorry for grammar. I am not an english native speaker. 

So  lately I (m/17) visited one of my best friends  (f/16) for the first time. 

Short Backstory: 

Actually I fell in love with her. Not like ""crushing"" or something. I thought this time was something different than with other girls I have met. I can speak with her openly about *anything*. She made/makes me really happy. The fulfilling kind of happiness. 
She has shown me so damn many signals that she might like me too. (But actually I've been wrong.)

Actual problem:
So I thought it was different this time. She often wanted to cuddle etc. 
(I am someone who doesn't really have that kind of friends who have less problems with body contact). Thats why I tried to cuddle as much as possible.. It sounds weird but it was something special to me. 

Fast forward. Today I drove back home.. During my ride back home she texted me that she was very umcomfortable with us cuddling and getting that close. So I was too affective and got too intimate.

Actually I feel ashamed. I want to be a comfortable person. A good human being. It Didn't work. 

I think she is aware of my feelings for her 
The worst thing is, I know now that my feelings for her won't be returned. It feels like an important piece of my life got ripped away.
I got over other crushes, this time not. Actually I did my very best not to cry in my math coaching today.

I deeply apologized for my behaviour, she responded, that it was good to settle that, so the next time we meet won't be weird or anything.

Yes this all sound very like a whiny overreacting piece of garbage,but I still feel like shit and I don't know how to cope with that.",1578085435.0
582,Lost both my parents within two years.,"I lost my dad to cancer yesterday. I lost my mom to cancer two years ago. Not even a year after my mom's death we found out my dad had cancer. A month ago he decided he no longer wanted to do chemo and decided to just go straight for at home hospice. Where he passed on new year's day. But I am upset with my dad because I feel like he just gave up. While I don't think he was the same after my mom's death, I had really hoped that he would find ways to actually be happy. Like have a pleasant retirement, get out of my childhood house because it sucks, and maybe even find a companion along the way where they would rely on each other and partially so I would be assured that there was someone else there when I am not. But I feel like he just decided that he didn't want to live anymore and just chose to not fight as hard as I know he could have. And that makes me so sad because I really wanted him to be happy and involved in our lives and now my brother and I have lost both our parents. And I know that it's cancer and life happens and maybe he did try his hardest and I can't blame him. But it sucks. I am 24, and I feel like I haven't had an adult life my parents could have actually been a part of. Like today I am staying at a friend's place because they were kind enough to let me hangout with them to get my mind off of my dad. And when my friend briefly left the room, her mom told me about how she is so excited to give my friend a birthday present she bought for her. And that is just so sweet and it's kind of hard hearing that because my mom can never do that for me anymore. Or my dad. And I hear that stuff from my friends a lot. And while I am happy that they have that in their lives, I am sad that I don't.  Most of my friends my age still have their parents around where they do nice things for my friends and I can't have that. My friends and my other family members are there and they are super supportive and I am grateful, but I miss my parents so much and it's just not the same. I wish they were still around so they can see that I am going to turn out okay and that I want them to be involved in my life and to really give them a hug and tell them how much I love them. 

Anyway, I'm not really sure I am looking for any kind of assurance or coping. I was just really sad and wanted to vent because it's kind of hard to find people that actually understand.

584,I feel like such a fuck up.,"Several years ago I got an art degree for basically no reason. I haven’t touch anything art related since I got out of school. I had a series of extremely short-lived good service jobs until I finally found one I liked 

After a year and a half I moved across the country for all of the wrong reasons. There I did food service again and started working pet care. Everything exploded and fell apart and I came home.

I’ve been working on pet care for almost two years. For the most part I really do not like running my own business even though I’m doing it. I’ve been working as a contractor for a lot of my work because I don’t like dealing with the red tape and trying to figure out clientele.

I really want to go back to school but I’m in $35k from getting my bullshit art degree and I can barely afford to make my payments (eventually I was just paying interest). I want to go back to school for psychology or social work. I’ve been taking on some related volunteer work to gain experience to see if that’s what I actually want to do. I’m also helping out a friend with their record shop, both of which I really like doing a lot but they don’t pay. 

I haven’t dated in two years, I finally scrounged up a good chunk of money to get back out on my own after making up the cost of moving across the country and back.

No matter how much I have tried to convince myself it's over I can't help but think it's just her going too far with a joke or something or she falsely blamed her depression on me and I can be there for her again.

I have lost 8 pounds due to unintentional fasting and food tasting like Ash recently. This is the worst I have felt in my life but just like I told her no matter how bad it gets for me I'm not going to take my life not because I don't want to but I don't have the willpower. I guess I'm right again. She would get mad at me if I was right too much.

Fuck me dude. 

The worst part in my book is that in her words I never did anything wrong and that made her feel inferior. I don't get mad I'm sorry dude I will never yell at you if you don't deserve it even if you tell at me it's fine ya know. Fuck I'm crying.

Fuck me the weight of it hasn't hit me yet. I have dremt nothing but good dreams her and it's almost been a week .last night I woke up with a heart rate of over 240 bpm wafter one when I saw her face pretty clearly it was scary AF and I don't know what caused it.

589,My parents’ marriage is a mess and i’m affected by it every day,"So basically their relationship is shit. Can’t even lie. 

When I was younger, ten or so, my parents would fight all the time. I never understood what for exactly, but I knew that I wanted out of the situation. I would look up articles on ‘how to talk to your parents about divorce’ and even PRAYED that they would split up. 

My relationship with my dad was okay at the time. He’s in the military, so he was always being deployed. (found out later that on one of his deployments, he was emailing a girl and even offered to pay for a plane ticket). My mom and I were close, consequently. 

In middle school, my wish for my parents to divorce was justified. Other than the constant fighting, two major events occurred: 

1. My dad received a DUI
2. I had found messages and videos documenting my mom’s affair — with my school resource officer...

Ever since then, I have tried to forgive my parents, but I just can’t. The situation has become even worse. My dad is an alcoholic and has bipolar disorder. He’s a narcissist that only cares for himself. He cusses out my brother and I.  He is both verbally and mentally abusive.  He makes my mother feel like she cannot do anything for herself and belittles her all the time. 

Although my dad refuses to plan trips to go on with my family, he has gone on three different trips in the last year and a half. During those trips, he hooked up with PROSTITUTES. Hearing this all through an argument made my blood boil. He went on a cruise to the Dominican Republic and even had the audacity to look up “prostitution in dominica” on youtube. He didn’t even delete his history on the youtube tv app. I was confronted by friends when they came over to my house, and I had to make up a lie to save my butt.

My mom cheats as well. I feel sorry for my mom however, because my dad is abusive to her (not physically tho) and I see that it takes a toll on her. I see why she cheats — because she is afraid of what my dad might do — but i just can’t look at her the same. She is currently cheating on my dad with some guy she talks to on instagram. Whenever she brings him up, she refers to him as her “friend”. I even found messages between them on her messages app and instagram. 

My mom has purchased multiple things for him on Amazon, and even moved money through my account ($1000) to give to him through paypal.  The worst thing about this affair, is that the guy she is cheating with, has a younger son. 

I don’t know where I was going with this, but I just wanted to get this off my chest, since i’m too chicken shit to confront my parents right now. 

This whole ordeal has been affecting me more than I want it to, and although they’ve said multiple times that they would file for divorce, it hasn’t happened.

590,How can I be more forgiving of myself?,"Everyone says they are their own worst critic, but my mind takes it to an extreme. Growing up, whenever something really, truly upset me, my parents didn't offer to help me overcome or rationalize it. They just let me work things out on my own. This led to me thinking (mistakenly) that they didn't want to help me because I was being childish or upset over nothing. This has since devolved into, for example, if I accidentally upset my husband over something, I will absolutely believe that I am incapable of (whatever the thing is that I accidentally upset him about) and it just goes south from there. 

For example, let's assume I forgot to pick up his prescriptions for him at the pharmacy. He's upset because he only has a few of whatever left. I feel terrible that I forgot, but I feel WORSE that I let him down. My letting him down means I'm a failure. I can't remember shit. It's a wonder he trusts me with anything. etc. etc.   


Of COURSE, none of this is actually true, but my brain believes it and it's like a downward spiral. How can I be more forgiving of myself and realize that I have very real feelings and to stop being so irrational about what WOULD happen over just tiny mistake?",1569374754.0
591,College is hard! I need some positive thoughts or something,"You guys.... I’m so exhausted. I’m a freshman in college and have only been going for about a month and I’m already struggling. I still haven’t bought all my books because my financial aid doesn’t cover everything, so I have to pay out of pocket. I have to work about 20 hours to get decent pay and I’m paid minimum wage😓. My job is exhausting because I work 9 hours shifts a day (btw not everyday just the weekend since I have no other time to work...) because they are down on employees and I need fucking money for books. Just coming home from school is exhausting because I commute and traffic is horrendous. 
  
Making actual friends seems impossible and FOMO is mentally debilitating. It really sucks seeing old friends having the time of their life’s at college and adjusting well, while I’m out here struggling. And what makes it worse is when they are constantly posting every fun thing they do. Like I get it!! You are doing great and finding your lifetime friendship while I’m struggling to even make good friends. I GET IT congratulations!! I had to delete my Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat apps. 
 
  I didn’t realize how bad it really was until I was hit by FOMO. FOMO really be messing people up. Oh and my section leader from marching band, who I was acquitted with is now a gorgeous model succeeding in life. She’s absolutely beautiful, amazing and humble!!! I love seeing her post but at the same time it’s not helpful at all because she has the perfect body with looks and pretty much everything society loves. That’s just a recipe for disaster for my mental health because I’m going to start comparing myself to her. 

I’ve joined some clubs so hopefully that’ll work in my favor 🤞🏾 also organizing friend hang outs is actually way harder than I thought. It’s exhausting.

Gosh and just worrying about trying to make sure I get my homework done on time is stressful too. High school really babied us because this shit is something else! Wtf! I feel the need to get my work done in one day or I’m not getting things done. It feels like I’m not progressing and it’s so freaking easy to just procrastinate. 

In conclusion, college is hard and exhausting.

First of all everyone in school shames me for wanting to be an artist in the future they all tell me ""u will starve on the streets"" or ""u just wont make money"" this as a person who loves to draw hurts alot. 

All of my teachers think im a dumbass and i just cant cope with that. My english and stuff are ok but i suck in maths and my teacher doesnt even help me learn when i get confused she just says ""we learned this already"" and ""why dont you understand"".

 My friends in school are mostly the smart group so even when i hang out with them im just the elephant in the room and i feel ashamed.

 I live in a country where the primary language isn't english so this is one of the only schools i can go to since my english is better than the native language here so i dont have a choice but to go to this school. 

Also i failed my math final last year and the school didnt even tell me if i passed the grade or not and now i am panicking and i am super scared since school will start in 17 days.

I am gay and this also attracts alot of bullying in school since most people arent ok with gay people being themselves. I cant tell an adult because they might tell my parents and my parents are VERY religious. I dont even know what to do.

I can't cope with this life and it's impossible to transition or be the real me in this country so I literally need to travel and lose all of my friends, family and my past life to live in another country that's accepts and can treat me well.

I saw a therapist (best of the best in where I live) and he didn't do a damn thing to make me feel better, but even worse he also tried to convince me that I'm not trans just to hide his lack of experience with trans people (trans people here are undercoverd because if they expose themselves to the public they can get bullied, harmed or maybe killed!)

I tried numerous times to convince her to go to a doctor, with no success). She moved abroad this year, so I try to talk to her as much as I can and help with whatever I can, but the problem is I am very bad with any social interactions, and I'm not really sure what would be a good thing to do in my situation. I don't want to be annoying and message her all the time, but when we don't talk for some time I become so anxious and afraid something bad will happen to her that I can't take it. I'm not sure if it's normal to be so worried, or if I'm really exaggerating. I take medication for anxiety and they help me, but when I'm worried about someone else I still have really bad physcial symptoms which I can't cope with. I try to do anything to distract myself, but it doesn't help very much and then I feel like I'm a bad friend or I don't do enough.

599,I am so sick of not being hungry or tired or thirsty.,"It’s so mentally exhausting realizing that I should have eaten but I didn’t because I wasn’t hungry. It’s so fucking annoying when I realize I didn’t drink enough water today because I wasn’t thirsty. It’s so infuriating not being able to fall asleep and lying in my bed until fucking FIVE IN THE MORNING. 

It’s like my brain has disconnected from my bony because I never feel hungry, I am never thirsty, and I can’t fucking sleep. I just want to be healthy but I can’t because I CANT REMEMBER TO EAT SLEEP OR DRINK. I am not even anorexic, I don’t try to loose weight or be like this, it just happened over time and I hate it so much. 

I have tried so many things I have reminders set on my phone that tell me to fucking eat and it STILL DOESN’T WORK BECAUSE IM NOT HUNGRY. 

I know it’s unhealthy and I am concerned for my health, and I know that if I don’t eat and drink and sleep there will be serious long term issues but i just can’t, I can’t because the day is a blur and hours pass like minutes and I feel sick after every meal and water tastes like shit and I have insomnia from my dad and oh look at that the BIRDS ARE CHIRPING OUTSIDE BECAUSE I CANT SLEEP. 

I don’t know what to do, I am so uncomfortable all the time and I can’t do a single push up and I am out of breath all the time and I know I need to eat and drink but I can’t remember because I don’t FEEL the hunger pangs, My mouth isn’t dry, my eyes aren’t heavy I feel like a fucking zombie and I am so sick of it.

602,How do I get myself to sit down and do something?,"Hi. I'm right now learning computer programming. Included is html/css, JavaScript, and then some other languages. I have a love for this type of work, and I know that I can get paid a lot. I even have a job already, as long as I learn the material first. 

My question is this:
Even though I love coding, I still find it hard to do it. I thought it was my lack of motivation, even though I have motivation, as I said before, but I still can't just sit down, and learn for even 10 minutes.


Recently, though, I was told that it's not my lack of motivation, rather it's just out of my comfort zone. Meaning: these days, I have nothing to do. So I stay in my comfort zone, which is my bedroom / house. And all I like to do is just walk around lazily there.  And anything outside of that little circle is considered therefore uncomfortable. 

I was told then, that I should just push myself into doing things which are uncomfortable, and eventually they will become more tolerable. 


But now my problem is, to do just that. How do I push myself to do something, when it's very boring? I don't find it completely boring, as I enjoy it. But I would still rather be in my comfort zone, i.e: doing nothing.

I'll tell you something, cutting someone out of your life that you care deeply for is like killing someone. It's the worst sensation I've ever felt. I didnt want to see her again, because I believed I could get over all this crap if I could just move on. 

When they showed up at my office, unannounced after three months of trying to contact me and leaving a note in my truck, it threw me off so bad. 

The block I'm keeping on them makes it feel like I've not gotten over them yet, despite the fact that I'd just not like to talk.

608,How do I “reclaim” my birthday after my mom’s death?,"This one’s a doozy. May 23rd is my birthday. May 23rd is also the day my mom died last year. My dad & I were with her, and in the immediate aftermath, I felt so blessed and honored and I found an incredible amount of meaning in that alpha-omega, as my mom nearly died carrying me, so it felt perfect to have an exact amount of years together. 

Now that it’s coming up on a year, I’m starting to feel a little differently. I LOVE birthdays, but I’m terrified that for the rest of my life it’s going to be a day of mourning. I will always share this day with her and that’s ok but it’s also not. I’m just frustrated, I think, about losing a carefree day where I could focus on myself and my loved ones, you know? I’m mourning my mom every day for the rest of my life - I wish I could just have this one day off to stop thinking about sad shit but it’s really The Day of Days to think of sad shit.

609,"sexually assaulted by a friend, do I tell our friends?","
I went to a show and got some bad molly. I dont know what it was but I put it on my tongue and as it started to dissolve it just didn't feel right so when the girl who gave it to me, maybe 30 seconds prior, was turning to put the baggy away I spit it in the toilet. We started to leave the stall and that's all I remember until I found my friend somewhere near the bar. I threw my arm over her for balance and just said I am fucked and she walked me to the car. I blacked out multiple times, I was puking And sweating. Barely staying conscious. It was the worst drug experience of my life.

She called a friend who was still in the venue for help. He got us an uber to his place and I just passed out on the first bed.

I have no idea the time frame.

But the guy who's bed I was in came home, a friend. He rolled me over and got on top of me I said ""no dude I am too fucked"" he continued, pulled off my pants, I put my hands over my, ya know, but he continued. Then trying to reason with him I said ""no wait, I like someone else, I like Jon doe"" a mutual friend, he said ""I know"". I dont remember anything else until I woke up the next morning to him cuddling me, confused, feeling sick. Then he did that thing where guys push their dick against you and grab your boob like....trying to seduce me, I guess, into round 2. But I was stiff as a board, pretending to still be asleep because I didnt want to have sex with him then, let alone before. I was just conscious now.

This has had me feeling disgusting and ashamed and embarrassed. A plethora of emotions. Especially hurt and confused because I thought he was my friend and I said I like his friend so in my mind I'm just like 'Is he really that scummy'.

So finally a week later I talked to him. He said he was fucked up too, didn't hear me say no and thought that when I said ""I like Jon doe"" that I said ""don't tell Jon doe"" (which honestly has me feeling really skeptical) But he was remorseful and apologetic. But also, saying suicidal things because he's a musician and the whole friend group is in a bunch of bands and they all live together and he felt they would disown him and he would have nothing.

I was already overwhelmed with guilt before because I knew it could possibly come down to a him or me situation in our friend group and i thought because he was a solid part of their group it would be him over me but he kept insisting noone would play music with him, they wouldn't talk to him, his mom wouldnt talk to him and that he just didnt know if he could live with himself.

I couldnt leave him to maybe jump off a bridge or go buy sleeping pills. We ended up talking for hours and I told him I forgive him.

I honestly don't know how im feeling but the dilemma I am facing is.. do I tell the guy I like that this happened?

On one hand, I feel like he has the right to know and i want to tell him for my own peace of mind but on the other hand it could cost the other guy everything that makes him happy.

I am so conflicted.

If anybody can offer some advice or something I would greatly appreciate it.

615,Everything is awful and I don’t know what to do about any of it.,"I don’t know how to write this without it taking a zillion years to read so I will just make a list of everything I’m dealing with and if anyone has questions I’ll be happy to clarify. If anyone has and advice or suggestions please throw any and all of them my way.

1. I still have not bounced back from an absolutely horrible break up that resulted in me having to quit my two jobs abruptly and get me, my cat, and my things back home across the country because I had no resources, friends, or time to find a place to live or anywhere to go before the break up was snuck up behind me, because my partner decided it was time to confess that he dragged me with him so that he could hook up with our roommate.

2. I have been getting dicked around by my health insurance company to the point of being constantly denied coverage for stupid reasons or just total lack of inaccessibility or incompetence on their part.

3. As a result of #2, I had to pay for a strep test and meds out of pocket because I was denied coverage for the billionth time, with money I didn’t have.

4. I’ve gotten 2 parking tickets a month for 3 months really only because I’m a fucking idiot or I was in a rush and the parking enforcers just happened to stroll on by exactly before I was able to run back out and refeed the parking meter, spending more money I don’t have.

5. I still live with my parents in my late 20s because of the absurd amount of money mostly #1 but also 2-4 have cost me, and I’m not making enough money to live off at my current job (which I will explain here further down)

6. My mother’s post polio took an absolute nosedive in the 8 months I was gone through the almost year I’ve been back home to the point where her mobility is almost completely gone. She was able to walk without assistance through most of my childhood, able to drive a car until about my sophomore year of college

7. I’m putting in my two week at a job I’m currently at because they treat their employees terribly, safety and professionalism has come into question, they have horrible turnover, most of the people I work with are awful, the hours are way too early and it’s taking its toll on every aspect of my life, majorly, I’ve been late to work more times than is reasonable and I’ve never done that at a job before. I’ve always had great punctuality and pride myself in being a good worker. They talk to me and treat me like I’m incompetent. I was denied a permanent position over someone who is a slacker, dick head, creep, terrible worker, and was a major safety liability basically the moment he was promoted (something that would never have happened if I had the position), I was given a scathing review that included absolutely nothing my coworkers or managers had ever given me direct feedback on or had spoken to me about (they had apparently had these grievances for months but nobody said anything). One of my coworkers is rude, abusive, condescending, inappropriate, and bigoted and part of our work is helping at risk youth learn how to keep and have a job and be professional.

8. One of my best friends gave me herpes, he didn’t know he had it because he was asymptomatic and kind of an idiot and I had to pay for testing and meds out of pocket again

9. Same friend been hanging out with his coworker who I do not trust and do not think is right for him, and I think he’s hanging out with her out of convenience and because she’s like “hot and weird and has tattoos” and posts nudes of herself, which is very superficially his thing. Not that any of those things are wrong I just think he’s in a weird stage right now where he’s kind of in superficial sleep around fantasy land because he thinks he won’t get hurt that way but I know that’s not true at all. I have a horrible feeling she’s going to hurt him and it would be inappropriate for me to say anything. I’m probably overthinking it but he’s so naive, picks partners for weird reasons (that frankly knowing him and his personality just always seem like such weird fits), and I think this person gives him more of a reason to keep drinking. Anyways all of these alarm bells are going haywire about this whole situation and I’m just constantly on preemptive protector mode and just don’t want him to get hurt. But again, am incredibly wary about saying anything. I have no choice but to wait and see how this all pans out. I also have to add that they first hooked up drunk while she was still in a relationship, and her relationship ended, and they’re still hanging, no pause in between or real thought into it. Which is a huge red flag to me but I think he’s too insecure and flattered or just so hyped up he’s not really bothered by it for him to realize that it should be a red flag for him too. But I’m also really displeased with him for going after someone in a relationship. So I’m conflicted about saying anything but, again, I’m SO bothered by all this.

10. Same friend is spiraling deep into alcoholism and depression/anxiety and refuses to do anything about it. He talks about how much it’s effecting him all of the time and has told me over and over again how badly he wants to quit drinking. It’s gotten to the point where it’s apparent something terrible has to happen to give him some sort of reality check in order to clean up his act or he just won’t and I’m going to have to just walk away because it’s just too hard to watch. I love him dearly and it’s so upsetting to think and feel the things I’m thinking and feeling towards him.",1545620849.0

The thing is, today I learned that people have noticed such frequent and sometimes lengthy visits. So much so that when I was in there just now, a group of jackasses, some of which I know and know me, started doing fart noises and complaining about the smell which there was none. Now, I wouldn’t have cared for this until they started talking about me, describing my shoes, the fact that I wear eyeglasses, and I’m sure I heard something about a video (though I’m praying that’s unrelated).

*I'm not sure what this sub is for. I tried just looking for helpful sounding places and this looked as good as any.*

I didn't know going into this very painful procedure I was in a no opiate zone. (a fucking surgical and emergency hospital!!?)

I get there is a currently  an epidemic of doctors OVER proscribing EXTREMELY powerful drugs.

I currently have about 60 incisions up and down my left leg that are glued together (a few have broken open though, bleeding stopped though)

I'm supposed to be up and walking around a lot the next few days to prevent clots. I cannot stand to stand. (weird phrasing)

I feel like i'm going out of my mind in pain. I probably wont even try getting out of bed all weekend (the worst thing you can possibly do after a vein procedure is to sit or lay still. I'm supposed to be walking!!)

I straight up asked for a 3 day rx for Tylenol 3. Shitty, barely effective (but helpful, really) Tylenol 3. She offered me some bizzare NSAD i've never heard before, and said she didn't like prescribing because it makes me an even bigger bleeding risk!?!!

I take enough NSAIDS as it is.. I throw up blood once or twice a week. Aparently thats safer and better care?!

I've never so much as asked for anything before. I've had several procedures on the viens in my legs, and while uncomfortable, and extremely shitty, I was at least able to walk out the door under my own power, and I survived the experience.. even if I didn't sleep for a few days because there was litteraly no position I could ever get in to make the pain subside enough to sleep.

This time.. this was way worse than anything i've experienced up until this point.

But no real effective and fuck it, SAFE relief because its fucking Friday, and no one is allowed to have opiates on the weekends!!?!

Is this normal now? Is it a state thing? Did I just happen to find a hospital staffed with sadists?

I'm not a drug user / abuser. I smoked pot up until a few years ago.. I don't like or enjoy pain meds.

The real fuckery off this stupid illguided bullshit is without even asking, a few customers of mine and a few friends have no problem getting or offering some roxy 30s (apparently a very strong version of percocet? I don't know. I don't want to play that stupid dangerous game)

620,Realized I never learned coping methods?,"Hi all - 

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 10, and have since been on and off Zoloft for 15 years. Now as an adult I'm realizing that I don't have great emotional management. I find myself overwhelmed very quickly when faced with situations or emotions that other people seem to handle with ease. But then with super difficult or disturbing situations/materials, I'm pretty numb. It's like I learned how to block out and manage truly shitty things, but never figured out how to manage the little stuff. 


I tried googling things like ""emotional coping skills for adults"", and when all I got was results about deep breathing and meditation, I tried searching for how to teach coping skills to children. That didn't help either since I'm not actually trying to teach a kid anything, I'm trying to get myself to a better place. 

I don't ""believe"" in deep breathing techniques or meditation. The breathing techniques make me feel like I'm trying not to suffocate, and meditation is just bogus to me (sorry to the folks it works for - but it's like hypnosis to me. I don't believe in it, I can't force myself to, so it doesn't work). 


Does anyone have any advice at all for me? ",1507742549.0
621,MIL nearly killed husband... and weird stuff,"My MIL is a psycho. 

My separated husband, 21, is in the hospital for alcohol poisoning and some prescription overdose. I went to see him a few times to talk. He was going on about how he is starting to realize things, how bad he felt about our problems and other things that are going on, and included that he returned home and MIL bought him all these crazy amounts of alcohol to make him feel better, because it's his weak spot. He said he drank a lot but claimed he didn't remember the drugs - I think MIL gradually discreetly slipped them to him, because he's only done crack or stimulants, has never messed with pills and never planned to. They were MIL's mother's pills and only she would know where they were. And she's the one who bought crazy amounts of rum, so lo and behold, exhibit A that she still wasn't innocent. These pills MIL's mother had, she's had them for years, but now takes smaller dose. 

I told him what I thought MIL trying to kill or OD him. It took him a while but he started pouring out a ton of stuff. He says he has visions in his head of what happened/might have, he doesn't know if it was a dream or hallucination or if it really happened. Basically he had very vivid visions with MIL. He remembers he was sitting with her at home, she was back and forth in the kitchen pouring drinks for him and her, and they were bullshitting. A bit after the fourth drink, he started feeling very rushed and deep into things as if he'd had like forty drinks or something. He said he needed to go to bed soon, so maybe one more drink then he was done. 

He recalls small bursts of things, like moments where he got super fuzzed and a warm feeling, then where MIL would stroke his arm with her nails, and she smacked the side of his butt and called him a ""bad boy"" for saying something he doesn't remember, and she rubbed the inside and top of his thigh and squeezed his knee. 

Then, even weirder, he recalls a super vivid scene of him looking through his 15 year old skater bangs at her - they were in the living room how it looked before it got remodeled when we were 16, and she was laying on the couch and was like cradling him on top of her and patting his butt saying ""Mommy takes good care of you, don't she?""

622,Does therapy help?,"I've never done this before so I've created a throwaway so I can do this anonymously. Also wasn't really sure where to post this so sorry if I'm in the wrong place.

I've had therapy about a year ago for roughly a month after being diagnosed with depression but I found that talking to my therapist felt fake and was scared that the more I went there the more people would find out. 

From when I was diagnosed I feel like everyone I've told has started treating me differently, and I don't want that. Also I was paranoid that if I opened up to the therapist it would escalate the situation to a point where I was constantly being watched and always for some reason felt like the therapist had some anterior motive and was more concerned with just getting me on antidepressants, which made me feel worse when I was taking them. 

I find it hard opening up to people as I constantly feel riddled with self hate and a feeling that no one really likes me but rather I just end up tagging along with other people's plans.

I have a group of friends both at uni and at home but feel I can never properly open up to them for fear of pushing them away and being isolated. I go out but whenever I do I feel very socially awkward and feel I'm a terrible conversationist with little to offer to any discussion. I feel like whenever I'm around people I end up being a joke as it seems like people are talking about me and making fun of me which escalates the paranoia. Also whenever I'm alone I can't stop thinking about past situations where I've fucked up, even if it was a minor incident that probably no one remembers I just loops over and over in my mind making me hate myself even more for fucking up. I feel like I constantly fuck everything up but don't know how to stop fucking up.

I feel bad whenever I talk about this because I feel like I shouldn't feel like this seeing as I've had a fairly standard childhood and there are people who have had it much worse than me but I can't help feeling this way. 

Has therapy helped any of these issues for people in the past? 

Another problem is where I live is a very small community and so word spreads very fast, meaning that I'm scared that if I do start therapy more people will find out and so more people will start treating me differently. ",1494760952.0

626,Positive Self-Affirmations,"Many clients I work with come to me with difficulty with self-esteem and confidence. One exercise that seems to work most of the time is the positive self-affirmation list. Each day you add one positive thing about yourself to a list. When you wake up and while getting ready for bed you read this list to yourself in its entirety. If you begin to think negatively or doubt yourself, you continue through the list and intervene on the negative thoughts with a counter-thought (exact opposite of whatever the negative thought was). For example, if you read the list and one entry says that you are intelligent, but you automatically have a thought that you are ""stupid"" or ""dumb,"" you counter that thought with evidence proving your intelligence (""Well, I passed the test, so I'm obviously not dumb/stupid"").

627,"Been stalked and harrassed for the past year by partner's ex-boss, how do I get him to leave me alone.","TLDR:  Partner's ex boss has stalked and harrassed me since July 2022, most recently having hit my partner from behind. Looking for advice on how to make this stop since police aren't doing anything. 

My partner's ex-boss has stalked me since July 2022. For context, my partner was unfairly dismissed by his boss in April 2022, they had to go to mediation/small courts, and my partner had submitted all the documents required in July 2022.

///Incident 1 - July 2022
A day after the submission, I receive a barrage of texts and a picture from an unknown number (which turned out to be the ex-boss's number). The picture was a flyer of my face, my contact number and our apartment name, stating that I sold marijuana and acid. The texts basically said that he would send the flyer to the immigration department, the police (in the country I'm residing atm), the police from my home country (where posession/selling drugs are punishable by death), and stated he would send some satchels of marijuana to my home country on my behalf (ex-boss works at a logistics and freight company, and we do know he regularly buys marijuana), and that he was happy to discuss before taking action. I saw but thought it was spam so I ignored it (I hadn't seen the flyer picture at that point, just the texts). 2 hours later I received a linkedin message from him saying he ""hoped to catch up soon"". Later on in the day, I was out at the park with my dog. At some point, I noticed my dog was staring at some trees and when I looked over it was the ex-boss trying to lure my dog over to him. The moment he saw that I noticed, he took off in his bicycle. At that moment something clicked and I cross-checked with my partner to see if the unknown number from before was his and confirmed it. I had never given him my number before as I had only met him a few times only at their Christmas staff party, and when I would drop by the office to pass my partner some stuff. My dog has met him a few times before as my partner would bring her into work sometimes so she's friendly with the ex-boss. 
After these, a settlement was drawn up between both parties as my partner's lawyers deemed that his behaviour was escalating, the ex-boss had to retract their ""firing"" of my partner and recorded it as a resignation. 
I did go to the police and they did tell me that the text could fall under a criminal act and could potentially put the ex-boss away for 3 years, but at that time I didn't think I would want to put someone in jail for pettiness (although now I regret  not doing it).

///Incident 2 - Oct 2022
I was walking to work early morning (5am), normally its fairly quiet and I don't bump into people, but I do take the same route everyday. I cross paths with the ex-boss and he mumbled something while staring me down. I ignore and continue on my day. 
On my way back from work, I was walking along the pavement when a car pulled up in front of me without warning. I looked up and saw that it was the ex-boss with his window rolled down, and his wife was sitting at his side avoiding eye contact. Ex-boss stared again and reversed and drove off. Both times it was raining, and I was wearing the same raincoat so I'm guessing that's how he spotted me from afar?
I reported this to the police as well.

///Incident 3 - Dec 2022
I was walking with my dog along the river and noticed ex-boss from afar, so I stopped at a spot to wait for him to pass. He didn't, so I went around him and away from the direction he was walking in. After awhile I caught a whiff of alcohol and felt like someone was following me, looked at my phone reflection and it was the ex-boss walking directly behind me, not even 1m apart. Unfortunately my flight mode kicked in and I just wanted to get away from him so I walked faster to be away from him. I only remembered to film him after awhile (the police told me to film him the next time I saw him as evidence as they said they couldn't do much without it), but my hand was shaking pretty badly so I didn't get a good video/photo. 

///Incident 4 - Jan 2023
I was walking with my dog on a main road, saw someone that vaguely looked like the ex-boss in front, but I wasn't sure. I didn't want to take my chances at that point so I turned off at a street before. As I was walking, I hear my name being yelled out and a bicycle whizzed past close to me, and it turned out to be the ex-boss. He said a string of words but I only caught my name and a slur. By the time I reached for my phone he had already dissapeared around the corner. 

All of these incidents happened when I was by myself. When me and my partner are out together or if ex-boss is with his friends, nothing happens. We live in the same neighbourhood as well, 2 streets away, so I've just accepted the fact that we will always run into each other at some point.

///Incident 5 - March 2023
My partner was at the park with our dog minding his own business walking, when he head a bike behind him and got smacked in the back of his head. He yelled and saw that it was the ex-boss as he rode off. 
My partner managed to get 2 witnesses and gave their names to the police, but not sure if they would give statements as most people generally seem to not want to get involved, which is understandable, but it does make it hard for us to prove to the police. 
My partner has gone to the GP and hospital and apparently he got whiplash from the hit, and the doctor told him he had PTSD (my partner was also bullied and harrassed by the ex-boss during his period of working with the ex-boss).
My partner ran into the ex-boss and some of his friends a few days ago and tried to reason with him, but all they did was take out their phones and filmed my partner. 

I haven't had a good night's sleep since my partner told me about incident 5, bad dreams just worrying in general. I've been hypervigilant since the 3rd incident (always having my phone on record when I am outside walking and looking over my shoulder all the time to make sure no one is following me). I'm just tired of it but it seems to happen when I least expect it, and I obviously don't want to record stuff everytime I go out of the house. 
I have been to the psychologist and I'm going back to see her next week or week after again due to this whole harrasment issue. 
All the times we've reported to the police they've just said they need photo evidence before they can do anything (if they even do take action)

Any advice on what we can do? I am quite sick of this and this man's pettiness and harrassment.",1680928171.0

630,"[TW: SA, violence, rape] my husband raped me AND said he loved me while doing it…","My partner (40m) and I (32F) have been together for a while, and living as married for about a year and a half. I’ve known him since we were young. 

Anyway, a few nights ago, we were intimate (we have a safe word bc we like rough things). He likes to do some stuff that pushes boundaries and requires a lot of trust, that being said, he had me on my tummy and pinned, but when it was brutally painful, I screamed the safe word and he said “nuh-uh”… I said it again and started crying… he responds by asking me if it’s real tears and I explain to him that it hurts… his only response is “I know but you can take it” and then he wraps his hands tightly against my mouth while I cry and try to get the safe word out, over and over… 
Him: “damn, you’re a good girl “
Me: shakes head and wines more
Him: kisses my cheek (while still pinning me and covering my mouth firmly enough that I can’t be heard) “Daddy loves his good girl.” 

I cry more tears and he tells me he loves me … three more times throughout all while I’m trying to get the point across and making it VERY clear that I’m not consenting… 

At the end he seemed more pleased than ever… I confronted him about it “you ignored the Safe word… it hurts so bad…” while numbly sitting across from him… 
Him: “I knew you could take it” 
Me: “Still rape”

The next few days are spotty and weird and he and I talk about it more and he says he doesn’t know how it happened and he feels like a monster and says that he is ready to turn himself in… I don’t want that, I don’t want to tear apart our family and don’t want to leave him…. 

I’ve been in physical pain for six days now, and have barely slept… but I’m not interested in ending the relationship (if/given that, it never happens again …)

Long story short; he’s depressed and wants me to press charges, I’m depressed and sore and broken, and the past that fucks with me the most is that he was so tender (cheek kisses and I love you’s) during such an incredibly violent and degrading act, the whole thing feels unreal…",1665569462.0

I can't tell my parents that he did that. I told them he tried to kill me, my dad constantly forgets that ever happened and all my mom did was hide the knives. He told them I tried to kill him, despite the hole in my door left from the knife he used to try to kill me.

640,"My 28 years old female sister, seems to have lost her ability to logically think, and it is so painful to experience.","Hi, I am a 25 year old male.

It is night of 13th of June. Tomorrow I have uni exams. I have studied well, it most likely will go well tomorrow. On midnight of 12th of June, (approx 20 hours ago) I received a phone call, from my sister's roommate. She told me my sister has been behaving differently compared to how she would normally behave. She has stopped sleeping properly and her sleep has been 3-4 hours per night (7\~5 days ago) and from what we know the past 72 + hours she only managed to sleep 2 hours.  


Yesterday, she was on a location near her job (Works at a club near sea, away from her main home which is in my city, about 1hour away from home). But for yesterday at least she took the day off. Another friend of hers who was with her, took care of her that day, and we decided that it is best that my sister doesn't go to her house where she is alone, but instead to our mom's house, where mom can take care of her.  
Her behavior changed: she is  hyperactive and she talks a lot. Her thought process can trick you into thinking she is logical, she is smart and can be manipulative if she wants to get things her way.  


She does not recognize that her behavior changed. She thinks she is fine.  


A few examples of paranoid things she said as I talked to her on phone :   
1) ""You're a man, I can't trust you"" (I am her brother, and we have been talking a lot and we do talk occasionally, we're part of each others lives interacting at least once per week, even if we live on different homes right now)   
Another example:   
2) She said to my little sister who lives with mom (little sister is 20) : ""I don't want we to go out because it's dangerous"" in an attempt to avoid visiting a psychiatrist.  


I called her psychologist (who is a woman) in an attempt to get her help and she helped a lot. I made an appointment with the help of her psychologist with a female psychiatrist on Wednesday (something less 2 days after this incident.). The psychologist did not call my sister on her own and she explained she doesn't wanna do that, so my sister doesn't feel as if we're all plotting against her.  
   
After 2 phone calls of me and my sister, I managed to kindly persuade her to call her psychologist.  
Her psychologist somehow helped her accept visiting the psychiatrist. She went to the psychiatrist around 4pm, on a public hospital, talked with **him** in private, which makes me worry that she doesn't trust him (because he is a ""man"") and she just plays a facade of pretending to hear him.   


At 4:30 pm after taking some medication he gave her she fall asleep, until 7:50pm. Her behavior has not changed. (Which is expected) Because everyone I talked with insisted, that what she needs right now is to sleep properly, so her brain calms down and after a good sleep, maybe, it can go back to functioning properly, and this might not take just a day of sleep.  


I have no other news other than that. I am a ""man"" and right now she can not exactly communicate with me. I feel helpless. I want to help but there is nothing more that I can do other than hope she will sleep. I started writing this post because I was uncontrollably crying, because I am in fear that my 28 year old sister might be gone forever, because her state of mind is not what my sister used to be.  


She is generally negative on receiving help from medication. The psychologist said that she is going through something called ""mania"" or something similar to that. I could not keep track of what exactly she said because it was complicated.  


As a family our father and mother broke up when I was 5, and about 3 and a half years ago our father died of heart attack (56yo). It has been a huge loss for us, it has affected my older sister more than it did to me and my younger sister.

What can I do to help my sister? How should I deal with this so I remain functioning as a human myself? I have university exams, it is so important for my life that I do well on the exams. My life depends on the exams and yet I want to focus on my sister.

I have no hobbys, we didn’t have much money growing up so I didn’t attend any out school activities or anything like that. And few weeks ago it somehow got my mind that… I don’t even remember what I liked to do when I was little. My mom didn’t lead me to anything and now I’m just at home procrastinating, binge watching the same to shows I already seen or sometimes I play a game on xbox with my bf but even that isn’t something I REALLY enjoy you know what I mean?

but I wanted to give an example too. Mostly it’s not that I don’t have an opinion but either I know nothing about certain thing or I just don’t care about it so when someone asks me I just say I don’t know and recently I’ve been told I don’t have my own opinion.

And about aspiration, it’s not like I don’t know what I want, it’s just so general. like I know I want to have my own house and garden and a dog and mostly I want to be financially independent and free but at the same time in my head it seems like a nice dream and I have no idea what to start with so I could achieve it

I apologize for venting out in here, I’m just feeling a little more vulnerable than usual today. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day, god bless.",1642361001.0
648,My 8 year old sister is violent and threatens to kill me,"My sister is 8 years old, and has a very hard time coping with her anger. She often says that she wishes I was dead, or that she will kill me, and when she does no one will miss me. She beats me up, and since I’m not good at monitoring how much physical force I’m using, so I let her. My parents always pin the blame on me, even when she gives me black eyes or bruises all over my body. I don’t tell my parents because whenever I do, I get in trouble. What do I do?",1641217715.0
649,I'm dying and no one believes me,"I feel so, so, extremely numb right now, but I suppose I must get this off my chest somehow. At the start of this torture, I was in the high end in the spectrum of my life, so I guess I'll explain how my life works. I have three very distinct personalities, though it doesn't seem like anyone else sees them as distinct. Philosopher, Comedian, and asshole. I go for months or weeks feels a certain way then it does a 180, I'm always either a 10, 5, or 1, 5 is when I'm most numb, 1 is when I'm angry at everything and extremely depressed, and 10 is when everything feels amazing. 10 usually corelates with the philosopher and I'm extremely creative(I'd say this is closest to my true self, or just is me) and sometimes I feel like this might not be a 10 but it's just how normal people are supposed to feel like. 5 usually correlates with the comedian, and 1 is the asshole, I don't feel like explaining the other two because my brain hurts and it seems self evident. 

Anyways, this has been going on since I was a child, every year my emotions become more exaggerated. I've seen other students like me get help from their consoler's and get accommodations like doing their work in the nurses office, when I do it, I either get sent back to class or they don't have time for me. When I feel dizzy or vomit, I just get sent back to class, whereas the other get sent home immediately, the Adderall the psychiatrist prescribed me accelerated my depression and my mom didn't believe me and tried to force me to take it, she then slapped me multiple times. My mom then gets angry at me when I skip class due to stress, my mom tried to unenroll me from my highschool which led to me crying in the consolers office and that finally gave me a break in the form of my school freezing my grades. Now that I was home, my mom was extremely angry at me and my parents were passive aggressive towards me. 

Now that I have a therapist, it doesn't seem like he takes anything I say seriously either, everyone just tries to give me meds, I just want to get back to being myself again, I've experienced huge memory loss, loss of appetite, lost over ten pounds, random fits of rage, numbness, I've sliced my chest. I don't know why no one takes me serious, I don't know what kind of tone of voice you need, but I'm dying and if I don't get help soon I don't know what will happen. Before this all got worse I was starting to write a book, if I don't get the cognitive ability back in order to finish that book, then I will kill myself",1640310640.0
650,I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years and now he's acting like a psycho,"THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY LONG! And its written on mobile so I am sorry for any typos.

Quick back story: My ex (24m) and I (24f) used to be friends in highschool. He had a crush on me then but he was kind of an asshole so I never gave him a chance. A year after we graduated when I was in college when ended up reconnecting again and we started dating because he had seemed to be a better person. I admit he was still a little assholey, but not as much as he was in highschool. Our relationship got off to a rocky start because he had issues with his last girlfriend and he didn't really want to commit. He would treat me like his gf, but wouldn't call me his. I'm older now and realize this was dumb to even try to pursue him but whats done is done. In the end when ended up together officially. Fast forward 2 years his anger issues start to come back out. I really struggled with thinking I was at fault though now I realize he's just a messed up person. He'd get mad if I wasn't in the mood, he'd curse at me. Call me out of my name. Disrespect me, my mother whom I live with and whom she even allowed him to live with us. I would give him the benefit of doubt because I know he didn't have the best parents. (His dad real life threatened me with a gun because I was too shy to speak to him, and didn't really want to anyways because everytime he spoke to me it was something crazy and Disrespectful, like calling me a hoe when he had literally just met me and had no reason to even think so, calling me a bitch, all kinds of stuff. Clearly thats where he gets it from, but he was never as bad as his dad) then he started breaking stuff in our apartment. Overtime my family began to really dislike him. And then my friends, Which of course I cared about but he didn't really seem to care. He'd call me out for being too sensitive when I'd get onto him about disrespecting me. Which REALLY fucked up my perception of myself. I now realize I'm not that sensitive he's just a gaslighter. Anytime I tried to end things he'd threaten to hurt himself and when that wouldn't work he'd threaten to kill me and my mother. He is probably a narcissist as well. I honestly could go on and on about all the things he's done but that would make this post WAY to long. Well longer than its already going to be... Just know he's pretty much an abusive person. Fast forward to now, about 2 months ago. This is when I began thinking I really needed to end things. He had been banned from being in the house when my mom wasn't there because we'd had another argument a couple days before that got too loud and the neighbors (we live in an apartment) complained on us. I had a dentist appointment to go to but I don't have my own car and my mother was working that day, so I had asked him to take me. He came early to pick me but instead of staying downstairs in his car he decided to come up. I let him in only cause i figured it'd be a couple minutes as I was still getting ready. Unfortunately it took me longer than I thought to finish up and my mom ended up coming home and she was upset that he was in the apartment. She yelled at me. Fair enough, I broke the rules by not sending him back out, but I was still upset because I got yelled at. I did explain that he was only there to pick me up though and later my mom did apologize which she didn't have to do. When I got to his car he than began telling me how I should've gotten ready earlier which annoyed me because I just got scolded, already knew the problem was my fault and I really didn't want to hear him going on about it either. I POLITELY tell him i would rather not discuss the issue right now as I just got yelled at already. And I know I said it nicely because you have to say everything to him nicely or he thinks you are coming for him. He then proceeds to get mad anyways and says ""I can't ever tell you anything!"" I try to explain to him that I'm already feeling bad. He continues to try to still talk about it. We go back and forth with me asking him to just drop it until I finally snap. I still didn't yell at him, but I was done asking nicely. So he proceeds actually drop it but also he decides to SPEED OVER 100MPH the rest of the way to the dentist. Google maps shows you how fast you are going and I had the GPS on as I didn't know how to get there without it. Everytime I would try to tell him to slow down he'd scream at me. I was terrified and he was literally just swerving through traffic. Its a miracle there were no cops around to see that shit because it wasn't even a short drive, though I was hoping they would then they could do something. He would speed in the car during arguments to scare me before but nothing ever like that! And when we got there he basically said I needed to apologize or he wouldn't take me back home but I wouldn't because I really felt I did nothing wrong especially to deserve what he did in retaliation. I was just going to call my friend instead, which made him even more mad, but she was at work. He proceeded to blow my phone up while I was in the waiting room because he wanted me to apologize. Then he proceeded to call my mother (also at work) to tell her she was gonna need to come get me from the dentist. She called me while I was in the dentist chair which was embarassing because I had to explain to her what was going on and my dentist heard everything. (I hadn't mentioned the speeding part because I didn't want to scare my mom) even the dentist said I need a better boyfriend. In the end he still picked me up and took me back home. But wait the story STILL isn't over. Now 1 month ago. We have another RIDICULOUSLY petty argument. The final straw for me. He wasn't banned from our house with my mom not being there anymore so he came over. His friend was in town and was leaving that day and he wanted to see both of us, so I told him his friend could come  over so we could all smoke together. (Weed) while his friend was on the way they were on the phone. I heard him say he wanted captain d's before he left. It's a seafood place that I really like. Which of course made me want some as I hadn't had it in a while. So I tell him we should go get some after his friend leaves. Fast forward to after his friend leaves, I bring back up going to get the food. He says he doesn't want that, and that he wants chicken tenders from some other place. I tell him he can get what he wants but that I don't want that because literally here in the south everything is chicken chicken chicken chicken. And I just had chicken tenders 3 days before. He then says okay let's get burgers. I tell him I just had McDonald's burger the day before. And then gets upset and is like, ""and you didn't bring me any!?"" Now he was supposed to come see me that day and didn't because he was hanging out with his friend. I was going to get us both food but he never showed! Which was fine because its not like we don't see each other all time and his friend doesmt live here anymore. Though communication would've been nice.. Then he suggests five guys. Great burgers but I'm paying and low on money and thats easily about $38 for what we usually spend there. So I tell him not this time. He gets mad because the only thing I want is captain d's (not true I just couldn't think of anything else and neither could he) and he's not willing to go to more than one place even though I said I'd give him the gas money. He just straight up doesn't want to drive to more than one place. I give up on trying to get food. And I almost forgot he's also in a bad mood because he wants sex. But I'm not in the mood for that either, especially when he's being so grumpy. So he ends up taking a nap on my bed and I'm playing a computer game. After an hour he finally wakes up, and is like let's go. I ask him where. He refuses to answer. At this point even if its not captain d's I don't care cause I'm just hungry. So I just get dressed and we leave. I keep asking him where we're going. I say McDonald's is fine. He's still not answering. I say SEVERAL times it doesn't have to be captain d's. Still no answer about where we are headed. And then we pull up to......... Captain D's. I keep saying we don't have to eat here. But we end up going inside anyways. So since we are there I order. He doesn't want anything really but tells me to order a smaller meal for him. So after we get our food and we are walking to the car he chooses then to tell me he wasn't a 3 piece instead of 2 piece. He seems like he's gonna be mad as hell so I offer to go get one more him so he will be happy. Happier. He says no. But I just go and get it anyways, they gave me the extra one for free so yay. He stays silent the whole ride back to my house. We usually eat and watch something on Netflix or whatever streaming service, so when we get back I ask him what he wants to watch. No answer. So I end up picking a show we started before that he seems to enjoy. Once he sees what I picked he gets mad again, and I'm like, I asked you what you wanted to watch but you wouldn't answer me. He complains more so I just give him the remote. He still doesn't change what we are watching but just huffs the whole time. Then he complains about how he didn't want captain d's. Then he wants to smoke again. But gets mad because I decided to roll a roach blunt (its rolling up the butts of previous blunts you've smoked because they still have weed in them) as I already shared one with him and his friend earlier in the day, and I would like to have the last one to myself. He refuses to smoke it (even though he's the one who taught me to use my roaches in the first place) and decides he's going to just get some weed for himself. I go with him because I needed stuff from the gas station which is across the street from my apartment complex. But he's STILL going on about the captain d's so I ask him to take me home. He doesn't. He makes me go all the way with him to his house whilst still arguing about the food. I'm beginning to reach my breaking point at this time because I keep telling him we never even had to go there in the first place. When we get back to my house I get out of the car forgetting the drink I bought at the gas station in his car because I was rushing to just get in the house. He grabs my drink but he's still going crazy about the food. I forget why but he ends up throwing my drink across the parking lot so I just turn around and walk upstairs and lock the door behind me. He proceeds to bang on the door, and I don't want to get another complaint so I just stupidly let him in. He starts rolling up, whilst still going on about the food which by the way he never touched. And I'm not proud of this but I snap and I end up just smashing the plate of food. All over the table. I paid for it anyways. He then has the nerve to say I COULDVE EATEN THAT. After not only complaining about not wanting it for the past 5 goddamn hours, but even going so far as to say he ""fucking hates captain d's"" he then tried to give me back my drink that he threw (it was a gatorade) but I just threw it away. He then digs it out of the trash so I pour that out (I paid for that too) and then throw it away. I'm just seeing red at this point then I go and lock myself in my room. He keeps telling me to come out and smoke with him (because he seems to think weed fixes everything) but I just tell him to smoke by himself. He then proceeds to keep going on about the food, and it escalates to him pushing my LOCKED door open. He broke the seal and my newly painted wall in the process. The whole door frame is split. So now I'm majorly upset and he still won't leave even when I ask him too. So it escalates more to violence. He ended up slamming me on my back. After I pushed him because he wouldn't leave. The whole time going on about the damn food. I finally get him to leave after he sees how distraught I am and I blocked him on everything. But guys guess what. ITS STILL... NOT... OVER. 2 weeks later I find out he has covid (from that friend that came over) and I'm sick as well. I unblock only to see how he's doing because even though I'm done I still care for the guy.  Though that turned out to be an instant mistake. Once he realized I was serious about breaking up he completely lost it. He showed at our house at 1am banging on the door after I blocked him again. Once he calmed down I told him we could still try being friends but that anything else was out of the question. Its been a month since this last incident and he is STILL calling me and texting me constantly threatening to kill himself and all other crazy things. He even sent me a photo of himself holding a knife to his neck. And I don't know what to do. A restraining order won't keep him away he doesn't care about shit like that. If I block him or change my number he's liable to just show up here causing more chaos again. I feel like I am being held hostage at this point. I've been ignoring him all this week but his texts and calls are getting more and more crazy. I've had to call his parents to check on him. I'm at a lost here and I am scared.

651,Burned out and depressed,"Now I know this is not the best place to seek help and I am also aware that tons of people have much bigger problems than I do.

In fact I know I am very lucky in life - my whole adolescent years I've struggled with school and was a depressed outsider while now being 34 I have a really well paid job, a wonderful wife, a house, fucking fairytale - the problem is I just am unable to enjoy it. 

I feel completely burned out professionally, I feel a constant pressure that I should be doing more, that I should work on new abilities or whatever and I feel very insecure. After 8 hours of watching excel charts and sales data, driving home for 1 hour I usually feel completely wasted. After doing whatever needs to be done at home (the bare minimum) the only activities that do relieve the pressure a bit is going cycling or playing some video games. Then you might ask what is wrong with that ? For one I feel guilt that I'm wasting my time, and the second thing  that brings me down is that I have no goal, I do not feel excited or passionate about anything. 

And the overall feeling gets really bad at times - it's like have you ever taken ecstasy ? I did when I was young and it was great - you feel joy, happiness and love for no reason and against all reasons. So there are days like I feel I have taken the opposite of ecstasy - there is no reason in the world but I feel so bad that no reasoning can get me out of it. And then comes the guilt again - as you can imagine it's hard to even put on a happy face and I just bring down my wife, which is the last thing I want to do. 

Ever experienced anything like that ? How did you get out of that hole ?",1633503561.0
652,How can I deal w this?,"So i just Downloaded the app since I cant afford therapy I thought of this. I (15F) moved to a whole another country just before everything w the covid-19 started, in March i started at my New school and it did talked that first day of school to a couple of girls but that was it we didn't talk more since the lockdown came and we didn't see each other again till now, that we went back to school. 

Now, back at school everyone has their one friendgroup and im all alone by myself. The girls i talked to last year Yes they talk to me, but only in class I thought we got along well but they meet afterschool, without me and thats not really the problem i really really get that they get along w eachother better than with me.

My thing is, I'm tired of it hurting, it hurts so bad seeing them going out without me even thought I KNOW that we arent that close and that I shouldnt be expecting them to invite me. 
And also in this new country everyone treats me well, yes, but its just out of courtesy beyond that they dont try to make any other kind of interaction w me and that just makes me think that they dont want anything to do w me just because im from another country. 
Because ive tried so, so hard to be friends w them, and ive been the nicest person ever, even letting them mock me and laughing it off just because I want them to like me so bad, because im so so tired of being alone. And I really just want friends, and If thats not possible i just want it to stop hurting so bad. 

I've had multiple panic attacks, over all this situation, a really bad anxiety that doesn't let me live, maybe depression but I don like to self diagnose myself over that one.

656,My life is based on lies and I dont know how to fix it.,"This is my first post so I may write weirdly, it also took a few years of guilt to finally tell anyone these things. For context I have an older sister who (looks like a fucking model) is half way done university at the top of her class, she got honor rolls every year in high school, won art and writing prizes, etc. She is an absolute prodigy. She is talented in every way and I loathe it. My younger brother is attractive, popular, smart and athletic. He makes the sport teams, gets A's in everything and is fucking fantastic with watercolor, charcoal, paints, arts in general. He isn't as well behaved as my sister but he can cook like a fucking chef. Anyways, then theres me. I'm overweight, afraid of water so I avoid showering, I fail almost every class, I have three friends, two of which live on the other side of the country, I have severe depression and I've pulled all these stunts I'm about to list and then some. I'm not a good kid. I'm the least favorite. So I try to make up for it by never getting angry. I bottle my emotions and work my ass off. I try to clean, cook, be patient, and just be good. It just makes me angry and hate everyone around me but I have to keep doing it. Also my parents dont even punish me when I get 60's in classes because I normally get 50's in everything but art, which I FUCKING HATE.
Anyways, I'll start with the first thing - back in my elementary school I was playing with my friends when i was pushed and hit my head, getting knocked unconcious. An ambulance was called and I went to the hospital. I only woke up when I was almost there, but my problem is that I was never unconscious. I decided ""hey, I wonder if anyone would care if I seemed like I died?"" So I laid down and waited. People did care. I heard my friends getting scared and worried, and it made me happy in a weird twisted way.
Next big lie is what I tell other people about myself. Whenever i meet someone new, i tell them basic information, name, pets, blah blah blah, but I also have a few stories I made up about backstabbing and drama, most of which are based on a true thing, but I twist them to make me look good or like I was the one getting hurt. This almost backfired when I told someone the same story twice- in two completely different ways. I covered it up with more lies and they accepted them.
I had cps called on my parents too. This one was proven to be bullshit and I still feel horrible about it. But I was bored an wanted attention so I told a friend that my parents hit me a few times and as people do, they told others. Until it reached my teacher who called me in to talk. I told him what I told my friend and he told me it was bullcrap. So then, out of idk, anger? A desire for attention? I told another teacher and she told the principal who told cps. I was interrogated for a while by my principal and I lied and faked my way out, thinking i could fix it once i realised i had fucked up. Wrong. My parents almost lost their jobs and me and my siblings almost got taken away. In the end the person from the CPS came to talk to the family and I confessed my bullshit to her. The look on her and my parents face is something still scared into my mind.
Next big thing, I steal art and stories. Hear me out please, even though I know this ones pretty bad. As I said above, by siblings are art prodigies and I can... draw? If it's even good enough to be art... anyways, I came across an interesting show made by a very famous company, (not getting into details) and I decided to take it and write it with the two main characters having different names. Just because I needed something. Long story short, I changed a decent amount to fit with another thing I made and was proud of it now. So I showed it to my friend who didnt know the show. And they said it was amazing. Now, I've never been told that. Not for years anyways. I always hear ""but your sister got a 95."" Or ""you wont make it to medical school, become an artist"" or ""you need to go on a diet"". It felt nice. So I took some fan art of the show and traced it. I showed it to them and they loved it. Thus boosting mg confidence. This went on for a while until I showed another friend and let me say, they're very smart. He reverse searched it and sent me the original. I lied and bluffed about how I'd never seen it before and Haha Haha, whaaaaaat? So I started to combine stuff. I'd flip drawings, use the head of a different one, change the outfit or coloring, etc, until it couldn't be tracked. Then I got praised. I've been doing that for years. I stopped showing them out of fear someone will call me out on my shit.
Those are a bunch if the big lies I've told. I have dozens upon dozens of others but I'm not brave enough to share them yet. I just always have a knot in my stomach from guilt. It weighs me down and I'm terrified to tell anyone because my parents are proud of me for something now. Even if it's a lie, I cant lose that. Please help me. I dont know what to do.",1621560238.0
657,Trying not to be ungrateful,"My husband is in his 40s, has no male friends to talk too.

Everytime he sees his family it takes me weeks to build back up his self confidence. His family talks ""at"" him and never listens, constantly belittles his achievements and pressures him to move back home. They never call to shoot the breeze. They have no relationship whatsoever. I want him to be heard but they don't know or care to get to know him. His family is probably the one of the most selfish people but hide it with their religion. They talk bad about anyone that doesn't believe in what they believe plus you can't even disagree with them politically. When we get together they talk over us, interrupt, are rude, talk mean about people and claim to live God. All they do is talk religion and politics.

659,How can I cope with my messy housemates?,"I live in a student house with 6 other people.  5 of them are boys (I’m a girl) and they’re all very messy. 

I regularly clean up the whole house, put things away in the kitchen, load the dish washer etc. 

Last night, 3 of the boys had some friends over for drinks. I got up this morning and there were bottles everywhere and the kitchen was a mess. 

Am I wrong for not just cleaning it up and hoping they had a good night? I’ve asked them to clean up after themselves but they always seem so offended or say that I’m being a bitch about it. 

Sometimes it literally makes me cry because I clean the house to make it look tidy and nice, yet the next day it can be immediately covered in mess again. Nobody every apologies for their mess or thanks me for tidying up after them.

I just feel like it’s so unfair that I always end up doing everything. None of them lift a finger even though they create all the mess. I genuinely can’t live in a dirty house so eventually I have to clean it if they don’t. 

What can I do? It genuinely ruins my days and stresses me out so much sometimes that I can’t do anything normally. It also is affecting my relationships because I’m beginning to resent them for it. 

Please help!


Edit: thanks for all the responses everyone! To clarify- these are my friends that I live with. They’re great people but just so lazy and messy. 

The problem is, if I don’t clean up then they would be quite happy to live In a dirty, messy house forever. They literally do not care about the state of things.

660,I’m just confused and need to vent about my sexual life and my past,"When I was a child, I was delusional. It was hard for me to know what was real and what wasn’t since I always lived in my own little mind to cope with my problems. Even though it was hard for me to know the difference, I know this started, and is usually happening, because I was constantly raped my men. Idk how many, idk when and I definitely don’t know where, but I know they all happened because I can still feel them in me, and I can still feel the emotions I felt before whenever I have sex again. This didn’t stop at my childhood though, every couple of months some guy would rape me, or I would at least let them put it in me whenever I go to a public bathroom. Even though I hate it it makes me feel more special, more desirable, more confident, and when I tell them don’t (if it was me letting them in me) I’d feel bad for them and feel like I’m not doing the right thing. Even though I hate sex I have a high sex drive (masturbate at least 3 times a day) and want it when I’m horny, but god the moment it happens I just want it to be over. When I let them in me I don’t go into my own little world again which is nice but I still don’t like it for some reason. I don’t wanna waste my youth being scared of sex, I’m already not that good looking and I know as I age I would just look worse and worse, people wouldn’t even want me anymore. Because of my horniness I have a lot of dating apps and I meet with guys every couple weeks and I always feel the exact same, first I’m horny and wanna meet them, we meet, and when we do things I just want him to cum so I can leave. Hell I just made a guy cum an hour ago. Pre cum is so gross, and cum is gross, I hate kissing and hate sex, who the hell would want to date me if they knew this about me? I wish I can just be normal and like sex but I don’t think that’s a reality for me. God what I would give just for it to come true",1617248810.0
661,Right for You (157),"In this moment, whats right for you? **Thats only something that you can tell.** 

We live in a world where we can choose, **light or darkness.** Light takes more time to work on with ourselves, where darkness can be more fast to connect with.

When you know whats right for you, then **follow it**; no matter what the noise around you is trying to tell you different. **Its what is in your heart.**

If someone hasn't told you this lately **I am proud of you, so keep going.** With the constant shifts of life, we have been shown that we can make it through everything that is thrown at us, **Together, Separately.** 

If you feel something different from the energy that you put out, then remove yourself from that situation, from those people and know that its ok provide space for yourself. When we allow the Universe to close the doors that are desperately trying to be closed, thats when abundance, people and experiences will be brought to you.

**I love you.**

Now they acted like I were never there before. Doing exactly the same thing with his new gf. Christmas dinner, new year eve, even the cards is replaced by her name. Feeling lost and forgotten. Like I’m just a piece of garbage that need to be throw away. What hurt me the most is that they didn’t return the money to me.

I told her eventually because i felt like something was up  i was right. we broke up like for three months but kept hooking up and talking despite being in two relationships ourselves. then he broke up with his rebound when i did break up with mine and weve been together since. I know weve had more then intense lows and a lot of how he has treated me and done to me is not right but we always have found our way back to each other. and each time same energy same love if not more. he is the only guy I have ever really felt safe with and just clicked instantly with. but something that just cant let me sleep is the fact he left me came back dated someone completely opposite of me and almost seemed to enjoy that relationship more then he did this one. i know if he wanted that he would be with her but it still just kills me. like what did i do to deserve being treated like this for 3 years for him to only be good the last month. like now that he is this great amazing guy i dont even want it anymore, why couldn't he be good the first 19 million chances. im just so drained now right when hes ready to get going.

666,Why do I feel this way?,"For starters, a bit of background. When I was a kid, I often used to argue with my dad and up until the age of 10 ish, he would hit me. I would be crying and screaming but he would still hit me with a wire or his hand. After he left, I would lock myself in my bedroom and lock the door and cry. I felt unloved by everyone and would fantasise how I might die and they would find my body and feel guilty. (I know it's messed up). After I stopped crying I would calm down and eventually my dad would come into my room and apologise. But this happened so much that I think it left lasting damage. We get along now but I still feeling slightly distant and indifferent when I'm around him. 

In primary school I was quite lonely and would wander around and do nothing because I had no friend group. I would talk to myself and just feel lonely for the whole of break and lunch. 

In secondary school, I got along with people a little better and clung onto my best friend. However, when he left last year I did initially feel lost and abandoned. It was like primary school again. However, I did have other friends and just spent more time with them. Early into secondary school, I joined a gaming group (with people from the school) and I CLUNG onto that gaming group as my main friends. I would spent hours after school gaming with them. 

Recently, I've been playing a game with a group of friends which involves working together to defeat bosses. I know it sounds so petty and privileged but I get the same feeling I did as a kid after arguments  (but a lot milder) sometimes when I play with them. I'm not sure why, but several times when we are quite far in, I start getting bored of the game and then resenting it. Then I start feeling upset towards my friends (though covertly) until eventually one small thing (like being told to be quiet after obnoxiously singing, or people starting a boss without me) which normally doesn't affect me, triggers this feeling and I feel rejected and lonely and start resenting them. I will stop talking in the call, feel petty and spiteful, and refuse to participate in the group. Every time this happens we stop playing and I take a ""break"".

I hate feeling like this because I'm well aware what I'm doing is stupid and hurtful in that I start ignoring my friends (kind of manipulative) but this feeling grows and makes me start hating my friends for NO reason.

My childhood might not be related to this but I feel the abuse I suffered is the same feeling and might be the cause.

Can anyone ""diagnose me"" or tell me why I feel this way? And even better, how can I stop having these toxic feelings and behaviours.",1609120903.0
667,Abused my entire life,"Typical intro stating I’m on mobile so sorry for any errors, confusion etc. 

I hope you’re sitting down while you read this, for your sake...this may be the longest post you’ll ever come across. 

I (26F) have an older sister (29F) diagnosed with manic bipolar disorder. I myself have been diagnosed with manic depression and severe anxiety, for which I properly medicate. Pretty sure I have PTSD (and I think my mom does too; you’ll understand why after reading), but I digress. We have a younger brother (18M), and he’s a great kid. So he won’t be included much in the drama that is about to unfold. 

My parents immigrated to the US in the 1990s, hoping to provide us with a better life. And they worked their asses off to make sure we never went without anything we needed. Now, I’d like to introduce the fact that my parents are relatively religious Muslims (and as such, we have been raised muslim as well). My mother was the epitome of a helicopter mom; terrified that her children may begin participating in the scary “western” ideals we saw on tv back in our home country (ie drug use, drinking at an early age, sex as minors etc etc - just think original Degrassi haha). So she was constantly overseeing everything we did, and by the time my sister and I were in our teens, our parents decided to protect us from “western culture” by having us wear the hijab and attending saturday Quran school. Growing up, my sister HATED all of this. She idolized the lives of her whites friends and in turn grew to despise us for being poor immigrants with “weird” names.

As kids, we rarely went to birthday parties, outings to the malls or movies with friends, etc etc. Our parents prioritized us getting a good education, having us join sports teams and academic decathlons as well. 

By the time I was 16 and my sister was 18, we’d decided we no longer wanted to wear hijab. Our religion states, after all, that it is solely the woman’s choice to do so. That caused some upset, but everyone got over it. 

Okay, now that you understand a bit of the background we grew up in, I’ll dive into the nitty gritty shit that really fucked me up. 

Our entire childhood, my sister was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive toward me. For instance: she once pushed me down a flight of stairs because she wanted to use the family computer while I was on it, and for good measure, she threw the computer chair down the stairs after me. The primary school we went to at the time required uniforms...girls wore skirts, but with the black bruises on my body, the administration asked me to wear pants until the bruises healed. 

Another instance: after asking to use that same computer for hw one evening, she became aggressive and ran downstairs to grab a knife from our kitchen and tried to slit my throat with it. Here’s yet another: as I was sleeping once in the early morning, she rifled through my closet looking to borrow a top of mine. The closet had a lightbulb not on the ceiling, but on the side of the wall. She threw a piece of clothing over it, and set my closet on fire. I woke up to smoke and put it out. She never apologized. She’s thrown sharp objects at me, broke the lock on my door looking for my adderrall prescription (which I refused to share), and once tried to run me over with her car. Another time, she opened and dumped an entire water bottle on the keyboard of a new MacBook Air I had worked hard and saved up for. I grew up in fear of her. She threw tantrums and always made sure to blame our family for it. We tried everything to help her; therapy 3 times a week, a psychiatrist that formally diagnosed her with bipolar disorder, and walking on eggshells so as to never upset her.

For the mental/emotional abuse, I’ve heard and experienced it all: “you’ve ruined my life”, “I wish you’d never been born”, “you’re a c-word and no one wants you”, “why won’t you just kill yourself already?”, “you’re a filthy fucking slut and you’re worthless”, etc etc. 

Okay, here’s some more drama. She found a loving, kind, pure (and obviously rich & white) soul to marry her. Lord only knows how. The kicker? She never told my parents about the engagement, and when they got married, she refused to invite my parents. What’s even worse is that she lied to her husband’s family and said the reason my family was not in attendance was because they simply didn’t love her enough to come. Literal absolute bullshit. 

She’s also been lying about living in another state for quite some time now. I suspect it’s so that she doesn’t have to deal with us. She sees us as low class and is doing her best to disown us. 

We held a surprise birthday party for her this past weekend, and we went alllll out for it. She showed up, said “honestly if any one of you triggers me I’m getting the fuck out of here. like I don’t even see you as family” (I can provide text proof of this). 

And then she broke my mother’s heart beyond belief when she walked in wearing her wedding band. My family didn’t know about the wedding. Their thought process was “how could they be married when she lives and works in a different state? Why didn’t she invite us?”....til it hit them: she’s been lying about living elsewhere the entire time. 

To this day, she uses her mental disorder as an excuse and reason for the way she lashes and abuses us. I’ve done my best to be patient as long as possible. My parents continue to forgive her and I honestly think they live in fear of her. Anytime we “call her out” for her abusive tendencies (or, for example, when she was confronted by my mother about her being secretly engaged), she threatens to kill herself and commit suicide. I’m not exaggerating that she uses the fact that she’s bipolar as an excuse for EVERY SINGLE THING SHE DOES WRONG. Oh, you threw a remote at my face and now you’re sorry bc it was your bipolar disorder that made you do it? Awww and now you’re gonna commit suicide because I called you out on being abusive?

I’ve tried my hardest to empathize with her. To read up on what it’s like to be a victim of manic bipolar disorder. But I think enough is enough. I’m ready to kick her the fuck out of my life, and never have her approach MY family ever again. 

Do you guys agree? What do you guys think? I’m honestly interested.",1603944215.0
668,My roommate almost killed herself then blamed me,"I (24F, cis) had a big falling out with my roommate (33F, trans). I moved in with her after I had to back out of a lease last minute and couldn't find a place, she wanted to help. We'd only been living together for two and a half months and had a bunch of conflict, a lot of which was my fault, but she handled it in really childish ways (like ambushing me and ordering me to move out). It started when she asked me out like a month in and I said no, and the way I said it was kind of transphobic - unintentionally. I don't feel like explaining, but she had a horrible reaction and fell apart for days. We made up after that though, and then we had many more minor conflicts, which mostly had to do with me being too judgmental of her and complaining too much about the house (it was kind of in disrepair and was super messy and a little gross). She was right about those things, I should've been nicer or just not said anything. I also made a couple small comments that were transphobic and I did not realize they were, and she called me out and I immediately apologized and learned not to say those things. My roommate then ambushed me, as I mentioned before, out of the blue one day as we were talking about our rent and told me that since I ""had so many issues and problems"" I'd be happier somewhere else. That was super passive aggressive but she was sort of right. However, the way she went about the whole thing was really traumatizing. The next day she apologized and said I didn't have to leave and that she was just trying to stand up for herself and that it got out of hand.

Our third roommate moved out with her girlfriend, and my roommate decided she didn't want to live with me by herself because she was uncomfortable with me. I don't blame her. However, she took in her friend (30F cis) who is super sick (gastroparesis and diabetes) and has a kid who would be living with us three days a week (partial custody). My roommate didn't really ask if it was okay, just pressured me to make a decision. First night at our house, she almost died right in front of me from low blood sugar. Happened again the next night, and then less severely a few more times. It was terrifying. She wasn't monitoring her sugar and we were basically her nurses.

She kept coming downstairs to eat in the middle of the night and the kitchen was like 10 feet from my bedroom, and she kept waking me up at like 3 am. The third time or so, I yelled at her for waking me up. I should not have done that, but this girl told my roommate I ""screamed and growled"" at her. Def an exaggeration. My roommate then said she was kicking me out the next day, told me I was a ""bossy, fake, judgmental piece of shit"" and that I shun disabled people, even though I myself have a disability. Also said I was treated our other roommate ""like a leper"" because she's a sex worker - she dances at a strip club - because I had said that it wasn't a good idea to have a sex worker move in with us during a pandemic.

Anyway, I found a place and I moved Wednesday night. Tuesday night, I came home and there were cops at my door. My roommate messaged several people making gestures toward suicide. Apparently she had a fight that day with a girl (30-ish F cis) who I'd met but didn't know she was sort of dating; that girl also turned her down, and I was told they had a complicated history of fighting and making up. Roommate is alive now, we found her, but it was so so so scary. I also found out she hadn't been going to work regularly for a month.

On Friday after I texted her I left my keys to her place on her coffee table, she texted me, ""Thanks for ruining my life. Never darken my door again. Here's how I'll remember you"" and sent a screenshot of her FB story which said ""I never thought the potential cost of helping someone would be that they would destroy my job, my relationship, and my home life. Maybe I should help people less.""

I told her I hoped she felt better soon, that I wasn't going to take that personally, and that I would be blocking her number, which I did.

Look, I know that people are responsible for their own actions, and I am not to blame for her crisis, especially the work and relationship stuff - I had no idea she was even skipping work or dating anyone. She does have a history of depression and has been suicidal two other times this year; she has had such major issues as dealing with psychosis and ending up beating up a friend many years ago who hurt her verbally. But I can't stop replaying all our conflicts over and over in my head and feeling like maybe I am partially to blame for how much she spiraled. I know logically that this is not all on me, but it's really haunting me. Can you guys put this in a more objective perspective for me? Can you talk some sense into me so I can stop believing her words??",1603694700.0
669,25 y/o to foster 13 y/o,"Hi guys,

I am a 25 y/o female. I was an only child til I was 20 when my father remarried and they had a baby girl who is now 5. My step mother is an immigrant and also brought her two sons over to America shortly after. Now they are teenagers, 18 & 13. 

Long story short I have been reporting my fathers abuse of my two step brothers to CPS for two years. They finally got some movement on the case and he has been living with me through kinship care for the past month.

Two weeks before he started living with me I quit my full time job and started going to school for my masters. I have my own business and still consult for the company I used to work for.

I have depression and CPTSD from the mental, verbal, emotional, and physical abuse my dad has put me and my family through. I love my brother so much and want the best for him, but this is starting to wear me down. Trying to juggle my mental health, grad school, two part time jobs, a dog, and a teenager is leaving me exhausted and unable to fulfill any duty at capacity. Since having him here the stress has been reeking havoc on my body, kidney infection, UTI, intense back pain, severe exhaustion (sleeping 10-12 hours a night), and my IBS and acid reflux are acting up again after 2 years of being dormant (finally got them under control after doing intense EMDR).

Just looking for advice on what to do. Foster care is telling me to make the decision now if he stays with me or goes to a foster home. I’m afraid he will hate me forever if I say I can’t do this but I’m also worried if I try to do this long term I might end up depressed and digging myself into a deeper hole.

Thanks for listening...",1601944952.0
670,How do people cope with close family commuting suicide?,"Sorry for the length of this but I think im a bit lost and need some way of knowing how to cope with it.


Yesterday I woke up at 5 am to my mother breaking down and my father in shock. I knew it wasn’t going to be good news, but I never thought it would be as heartbreaking and as the situation actually is. I live in a small town in NS Canada where you really don’t hear much crazy events happening, or any suicide rate for that matter. My grandfather died 1 year ago as of a few days ago which I just kind of got over, but he was going on 85 and had liver failure so I knew it was his time to go, but this time is so different. My cousin was 23! Grew up with that beautiful human all of my life, I knew he had issues but not this bad :( I heard that my first cousin was dead at 23 and thought maybe it was a car crash or an accident but my family told me later that day yesterday that he went to our aunts cottage and hung himself with a rope in the shed. My uncle (his FATHER) was the one to find him hanging in the shed along with a note he wrote to them. This was something I could never dream about in my worst nightmare and it’s happened out of the blue. I’ve been crying intensely every few hours thinking about him. Anyone know how to cope with a loved ones suicide?",1601387175.0
671,I think I was sexually assaulted/abused by my uncle as a child and I repressed the memory.,"Hey... this is a bit long but I really want advice or opinions and thoughts here on whether or not I seem to have repressed sexual trauma? Specifically from my uncle. I just. Need to know. I want to know. I wish I remembered. These are most of my symptoms and some backstory, they’re not perfectly in order but.. 

    1. I did “games” with my friends where they’d “prank” me and do something semi-sexual. Stuff something down my pants and I’d pretend not to know and they’d laugh at me. But these were all my idea. (I feel so guilty for this... I didn’t know what I was doing and I so much hope it didn’t affect them) 
    2. I had rape fantasies growing up. And rewatch rape (or buildup) scenes or think about them. 
    3. Don’t remember any other childhood memories of him/memories where he’s not present
    4. I’ve had certain symptoms my whole life
    5. Being uncomfortable around uncles in particular and scared
    6. At some point developed severe sexual intrusive thoughts that were 90% incest based, none of them involving him, but that’s because they only ever involved people I was near physically and I would almost never seen him.
    7. Vaginismus which is often trauma caused
    8.Insane guilt complex around sex like not doing something the other person wants
    9. Never been able to cum during sex
    10. Until sex was normalized at 17 for me I found it disgusting and refused to learn or talk about it
    11. Once I was educated on mental illness, I immediately identified that it felt in every way like I’d been sexually assaulted- but I didn’t have any memory of it.

    12. I have OCD and a trait of OCD is intrusive thoughts and because of that my previously good therapist told me I didn’t have sexual trauma, however every care professional I’ve had (which is quite a few), upon seeing my diagnoses, symptoms, and story with mental illness, immediately asked if I had any sexual trauma with a confused look on their face. And when I said no, some even followed up with “uh, are you sure?”. I know there was nothing in my chart because although I experienced symptoms, I felt SUCH extreme guilt and shame and grossness- I refused to tell anyone. 
    13. I’ve had 3 friends with major sexual trauma (all of whom had also repressed their memories for most of their life) tell me I definitely do have it. One of them even describing the exact same symptoms I have. 
    14. The uncle whom I think did it’s entire family makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I’d refuse to go to family events if they were there but specifically the male members
    15. I have a very weird very vivid memory of my uncle, it’s one of the only ones I have from childhood, I don’t know how young I was, but young enough to be afraid to close the door when using the bathroom and to get fully undressed to pee. He walked past the open door but saw me out of the corner of his eye and stopped. Turned and stared at me. Laughed to himself. And then continued staring for a long enough period of time for it to make me uncomfortable. I can’t remember if he leaved because he wanted to, or because I asked/begged him to. 
    16. Tonight I was high and processing symptoms with my friends (two of the previously mentioned), and later sitting outside, began trying to visualize it. It was a weird experience. Like a slideshow of stock photos of me and my uncle, different situations. They didn’t feel real. But then one specific image appeared. And I immediately tried to get rid of it. But my brain kept going back and setting on that one. I tried to place details to the memory. Like if it was outside or inside. How old I was. Anything. But all I have is an image where almost every detail keeps shifting. It’s me, in his lap, lying on my back and him looking down. Hand on my stomach usually. Every time I thought about it I would feel scared and uncomfortable and gross and try to get rid of the thought as quick as possible. And I would tic (I have a tic disorder that only comes out during panic attacks lately) and it’s like my brain would reset and I’d have no memory of it. And within a few seconds the memory would fade back in. And I’d tic even worse. And the pattern would continue. Then I started getting other physical symptoms. I started to cry. I shook. I got cold. My heart raced. And I fell into a panic attack.
    17. I finally realized half of my symptoms and how much they connected.

Can anyone give me thoughts or opinions or anything? This has been plaguing me.. sometimes causing panic attacks. I’ll break down sobbing. I just want to know if it’s real. I just want to remember and I hate that I can’t.",1601362405.0

But when I confessed my feeling she... laughed I was so sad (it was through text btw) so she said “ I’m laughing lol 😂” so I texted back that yeah it is it’s ok to laugh  it’s funny while crying.

673,Why is my life boring?,"I’m 15 years old, my academics is just fine—above average. I’m a guy known in school only for my talents in guitar—and lack of proper growth and practice. I’ve a knack for thinking of solutions through patterns, and figuring things the way I do it... though I seem to realize that this is the root... maybe.

Not one person in my life has ever touched my heart, opened my eyes or ever nourished me, teached me, more than I did myself. I had to find my own ways, since my parents are too occupied to make our lives stable. (We lived through rent since I was born.) I had little friends through childhood due to very volatile and childish—but also painful—temper. (I had thrown and hurt and cut and stabbed people back then. That made me look like a wolf to other kids—growling like one. And yet I threw chairs at them.) One, two, sticked through and put up, as I changed so much.

I had no romantic relationship—that stuck through, atleast... I had little experience...

No one taught me. And all I am right now is just trying to get by through—like a weed trying to grow through nook and crannies without ever growing upwards. And I don’t even have any desires or goals or emotions or... anything. I don’t fucking know. I don’t wanna kill myself—I’d just ruin everyone’s day, moreso my already struggling family.

I want someone to help me, and teach me grow. Someone to look up to, or someone to grow alongside with, or someone... I just want a change of paths—Something to actually look forward to. One thing that just, I don’t even fucking know why it was a good idea but I stuck to my brain that “oh, no matter what, I’ll always get through by myself, I could figure things out.” “I’ll just keep up appearances—no one has to know. Nobody needs to know that I’m becoming more of a fucking shell.” The only emotions left is anger and sadness. I can’t even get myself to smile genuinely for people I do care. I don’t know what the fuck I’m trying to do, and I want someone to make me see. See the things I could be. Make me feel—feel emotions and thoughts that motivate me from deep within. I want someone to make me grow. Is someone out there, please. I’m suffocating, and I don’t even know how to show it.",1597239117.0

676,Struggling with someone telling me I'm fucked up.,"I'm moving out of my apartment this month after living with my roommate for a year. We each treated each other badly, and I fully own that. I didn't pull my weight with chores and cleaning, didn't think of her feelings sometimes, disrespected her property, and meddled in her love life once (with good intentions, wasn't doing it to be malicious, but it was still unacceptable and she felt betrayed). She could be condescending, passive-aggressive, or insulting, was unpredictable sometimes in her reactions to things and treatment of me, unreasonable, very judgmental, and controlling. Would handle conflicts by terrorizing me to a certain extent, insulting me, and once, threatening me. Just generally scary; I'm afraid of her now.

She doesn't recognize that some of her behavior has been unacceptable - double standards, unsolicited advice, unnecessary harshness and meanness. But because I've done selfish things this year, and I mean truly selfish and inconsiderate, she feels she can't trust me and has condemned me as a person. We had a stupid dispute last week where I asked our landlord to jog my memory about a rent question, and she accused me of going to him to steal her security deposit. Yesterday she confronted me and she justified that by saying that since I technically broke our lease - I waited to tell her I was moving because I was afraid of her reaction, not that breaking a lease is okay - that she couldn't trust me anymore and therefore assumed I would steal from her. I don't blame her for not trusting me anymore, although accusing me wrongfully isn't okay. She said I was a selfish, fucked up person. She used those words exactly: selfish and fucked up.

I'm having an EXTREMELY hard time processing this. On the one hand, this is just one person's experience with me and I have treated hardly anyone like this. I have had some issues with cleaning with other roommates, but that's a common issue, although I'm not saying it's okay. I've learned in therapy that I tend to think I'm much worse than everyone else, I take harsh words as fact, and I'm very very hard on myself. I've always been treated like I'm screwed up, bad, broken, or like there's something wrong with me - my own mother told me I was fucked up when I was 14. In therapy in general, I've been taught to treat myself with the same BOTD, understanding, and kindness as I give other people, and not to absorb the things mean people or family members say to me, because it says more about them than it does me.

On the other, she's right about some things. I've been disrespectful and selfish, and I've had more minor issues with that in the past. I have a history of only thinking about myself sometimes and violating people's boundaries.

So please, be honest. Give me some perspective: what shitty things have you done? In the grand scheme of things, are these things reprehensible? If you need to ask details about our conflicts to make a judgment, please do. Am I a fucked up person? Is this enough to determine that I haven't just done bad things, but that I am bad? Or is this just salt in a long-standing wound and because of that, I'm feeling worse than I need to and magnifying my faults?",1595098482.0
677,What can I do about this co-worker?,"My office manager is insecure and is always looking for credit. Today I was doing notes outside the conference room. He was talking to the regional team and he was shouting. I overheard him say.” The changes in production we have made is going the right direction. The back office will be going through a phase with the new DA. I will not allow them to say no to any treatment. They will have no say in that. I will continue making them better. 

The reality is after covid our schedules took a few weeks to fill. I’m a work above and beyond. Offer same day dentistry to patients type of dentist. I diagnosis with confidence. My patients accept treatment. My assistant has a can do attitude  and my hygienist will double column. The office is doing well again . The patients are coming in. And the back team is doing exceptionally well gaining trust and providing treatment. OM has not once had to tell us why this treatment can’t be done today because.. most of the times they are started.  So to hear him take credit for everything with the regional team was so upsetting.

He has a trend of making calls in the region and spreading false rumors about me to the region. When others come to help out and work with me.. they all say Dr. you are misrepresented in this community. You have been portrayed falsely. I’ve had 5 people tell me this. I love my office. My back office and my patients. That's why I haven’t left yet but assistants have left citing him as the reason. One assistant even told me that he calls me a psycho bixhj to her whenever I question him. That assistant quit because she couldn’t understand why om is being so nasty towards me.

I’ve involved the regional manager with some of the discussions but She is best friends with this OM. He always calls her and misrepresents me when anything happens and she gets to not hear my side of the story. Either because I’m busy with patients or I have no faith in there ever being any repercussions.

679,Devistated,"I'm VERY well versed in both CBT and DBT. The guy i've been seeing and I were making plans for the future. He was finalizing his divorce with his ex( My bad but this was new territory for me), and at last minute got cold feet. He DID finalize the divorce, but before he did I got so drunk in trying to cope that i gave myself a concussion, which obviously freaked him out. Then he went into a depression where we went from sending at least 100 messages back and forth per day to nothing for two days. We decided to scale things back to friendship, and rebuilding trust. Which i was totally on board with as long as he let me in and let me help him cope. Yesterday, I felt pushed out (totally my own head trip). Regardless, i didn't know how to cope and turned to alcohol again to try to do so. I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just in so much pain that all the skills i've learned in therapy are failing me. Last night, i got shitfaced and gave him an exclusive tour of my struggle with living with chronic suicidality (usually well kept under control, but with the current circumstances, it's at full-bore). I'm almost 40. I've never been in love with someone the way i am him. Even if we fully take a break, i feel like i'm going to implode. 

If anyone makes a comment about him being a shit bag, it will be deleted. He's not. This is just a horrible situation that neither of us could have seen coming. 

I'm so depressed that often times i'm capable of nothing but staring at the ceiling. When i'm feeling ok, I'm taking advantage of that and being as productive as possible. 

Honestly, i don't expect anyone to have any advice for me. i'm coping as well as I can. This situation is just fucked, and there's no way to back up or reverse because i'm already so emotionally invested.",1593093981.0
680,My life feels like it’s falling apart,"I genuinely don’t know how to start this but I can’t post about tbis or talk to anyone I know yet as I don’t think they will understand
Throwaway account and some
Details changed for obvious reasons



A bit of background is that I live with my mum, and two younger siblings, my father isn’t in our lives and their father is barely in the picture. 

My mum got diagnosed with MS, arthritis and CFS and other things over the course of a few years after I turned 11, and I’ve had to adapt to that. I’m now 19, (F) and it’s been hard. She also has memory issues due to the Ms.

I’ve recently been diagnosed with ME/CFS, IBS, depression, anxiety and found out one of my kidneys that’s hasn’t been working amazingly since I was born, is getting worse to the point my stomach on that side hurts constantly. I’m also underweight and have been struggling to put that on, which I’m bringing up to help explain why I have not got a lot of strength*

I haven’t been able to keep any jobs as I get too tired, and it causes me a lot of pain doing so much. I’ve been trying to maintain a job as a bartender and often come home sobbing. I try to keep these jobs as I need income and my mum has called me out before for just being at home in bed, without a job.

Me and my mum are both constantly exhausted, which has lead to us arguing a lot this year as since she had the second baby she hasn’t slept at all, she usually sleeps really well but is still tired due to the CFS, but now without sleep she’s started to have extreme mood swings, which is entirely understandable considering!! 

I try my best to help around the house and help with my younger siblings (one is 3 years and the other is 7 weeks) the one who’s 3 years is nonverbal still and we don’t actually know what that’s about but with Covid we haven’t been able to visit the doctor appointments for any of us

A lot of our arguments start bc my mum feels like I’m not helping enough, but she also screams at me if I start to put away dishes, or sweep bc I’m not doing it right or fast enough, and this causes me to start crying as I feel so guilty that I’m not doing enough for her or doing things well enough to help out. I struggle* to hold my siblings sometimes when she needs me to, and that can cause arguments also. She is the most amazing mum, she does everything for me and she’s brought up three children while being so ill she’s sometimes in bed scream crying and it’s been so hard these past few years. It’s gotten worse since she had the babies, and I love them so fucking much.

I recently tried to take my own life, and ended up in hospital. This was when I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and got given medication for it. I’ve been doing well since and felt like my life was getting much better!! But recently it’s gotten much much worse again, as my mum isn’t coping with my siblings at all and spends a lot of time crying. Today was especially bad as the 3yo was screaming all day, non stop, and has taken to banging her head on things and biting my mother.

It’s 1:25 am right now and, my mum sent me a text at 12:30 saying she can’t do this anymore and she’s giving my siblings to their dad as she can’t continue to live like this and it’s not fair to them, she said she’s so sorry she’s failing me and them, and that she clearly can’t look after children and she’s worried she’s the reason I’ve ended up ill and suicidal, and I genuinely haven’t known how to respond, she’s downstairs sobbing but has told me she doesn’t want to talk to me. I don’t know what to do, how to cope, what to think. I can’t lose my siblings. I can’t. They’re the only things other than my mother and girlfriend that are making me smile lately, I have my mums best interest at heart but I just don’t know if I can deal with this. I love them. I love her. I’m so scared to be alone, my mum has had suicidal thoughts in the past herself and last year police had to bring her home after she left in the car around three am and I had to call my nan and the police. This has made my household sound so unstable and toxic but I promise you it’s the most beautiful home and usually is just so amazing and I’m lucky to have my mum, as again she does everything for us, and she’s also accepting of me being gay, was there for me when I attempted, has been there for me through my illnesses even when she’s been so sick herself, she pushes herself too much and I know she can’t cope with my siblings but I can’t help but feel it’s my fault and I haven’t helped enough. Some days I just stay in bed and don’t even help with things like the dishes or cleaning the house or looking after my siblings. This whole post is a rambled mess and I don’t even know what I’m looking for I just
God.


Edit: My mum spoke to me a few days after this and told me she was just really sleep deprived and hadn’t taken her meds and ended up freakin out, and has realised she does not want to not see my younger siblings again so she’s not going to be giving custody over to their father!! I’m going to be doing my best to get out of bed at 8-9am each day and stay awake and help out, I take so many naps a day and I’m going to try to limit them to only when my mum takes a nap so I’m awake when she is and needs me!!

Edit 2: My girlfriend broke up with me today, bc she can’t deal with me being so tired and having to cancel so often, which is understandable, she said she just wants me to be happy and still cares deeply for me but god it’s hit hard.",1593044988.0

682,What if I am the reason for my problems?,"Hi, I don't know if this is the right place for this and I am sorry if it isn't. The thing is that I (15) am currently at home with my family. Normaly I am at bording school, so i don't have to deal with them. I never had the best relationship with my family (My sibling once triggered my phobia of human touch until I broke down crying, my mom told me that she never wants to see me again and that she wished, I wasn't her child usw.). I am also suffering from chronic headaches, the mentioned phobia and some other things and my family is always moking me for it. I never was really popular at school and hadn't had healthy friendships until I started boarding school last year. (Sorry for whining)

But recently, I started wondering if maybe all this was my fault. What if I am just a shitty human being and the reason my family doesn't like me is that they know me and know that I am a bad person. What if I nerver had any friends, because I am just unfriendly and not a nice person. What if I don't have headaches and this phobia, but I am just whiny and if I would be more mature, I would just deal with it because it is normal? I don't want to be a useless, bad person, but what if I am and my family has been right the whole time. I mean, they should know, they have known me since I was born. Now, I feel bad for asking for help or talking to people because, I don't want to burden them with me, I mean: no one wants to be near a horrible person.

So... the whole reason behind this post is that I need someones opinion about it. Sorry, if i wasted your time.",1591129173.0
683,Zero Privacy issues from parents,"Im confused and I need to ask real people rather than the google engine because it’ll just give me generalised answers but i have zero privacy from my parents and they don’t care. 
Just for some background information, my parents’s office is situated right in the middle of my bedroom. We live in an apartment with two bedrooms and they basically own both of them. first bedroom they sleep in and have their closet and their bed but the room is solely used for them at night (my dad sleeps on the couch most of the time though). Then there is the ‘children’s’ bedroom where my brother and I sleep. In the room, my parents have two computer desks and a printer which my dad uses at any time of the day and never even knocks. Never mind the fact that he uses our bedroom, but also I’ve asked him politely and in a calm manner to at least knock but since his work is more important he says I should just live with it. Also we have an en suite bathroom which my dad uses for himself and so whenever he feels like showering, he’ll just bust into the room regardless of what time of day it is. 
As a child I never questioned it since he is the ‘boss’ of the house and he makes the money so I can’t go against him but it always didn’t seem right. Especially when friends would be able to come for a sleepover I was also so embarrassed because even those from lower income households, shared a room with their siblings but not with the office of their parents. 
Now I would like to mention that I do acknowledge that loads of people have it worse than me in the world and that many households have to sleep in one room so even though I sound like a spoilt ass brat as I’m always called, I’m just not sure if this is okay anymore. 
Anyway so as a child I never questioned it but since im older now, I finally am able to ask him why doesn’t he and my mum just sleep in here, then they have their office and bathroom in one place and let my brother and I have their room, but according to him I’ll move out in a two three years anyway so it doesn’t matter. For reference, he has been saying that ever since I was about nine (I.e. you’ll move out in seven years anyway so what’s the point).
This I’ve just come to accept and agree with but it still bothers me how little privacy I have. I never got to watch things or do anything without constantly wondering when someone was going to come in. (I’m not doing ANYTHING suspicious 😂 or hiding stuff I promise, but it’s just an uncomfortable thig if that makes sense). And even when told him this earlier he just says ‘tough, sucks for you’. This really bothers me and I just want to leave this house but obviously for financial reasons cannot.

685,Bad roommates.,"I'm living in a place that has had coronavirus pretty bad for a while. When it first seemed bad (end of Feb), my boyfriend's roommates (m27 and his live-in girlfriend f20... they are super toxic but that comes later) went to New Orleans, came back crazy sick. Coughing, sneezing, fever, the works. Kept going on with their lives. Got my boyfriend sick and he actually did the prudent thing of staying home until he felt better and had no more cough.

So when Coronavirus shelter-in-place ordinances came in 2 weeks later, we were worried about sheltering at his place. What sealed the deal is a few days before the official shelter in place came in, they had spent the day helping her undergrad friends move out, brought in a ton of food and objects from other people's houses, then one of the people they had helped tested positive. When we asked if they would try and isolate to their own room in the apartment as much as possible, the little kid said very curtly ""i can't focus in our room. i don't deserve to be less productive because you don't want to get sick"".

Needless to say, we got the fuck out of there and have been quarantining at my place. Now my lease is up and we have to move back in at the end of the month. We are moving slowly to not make it a miserable day, and as we were dumping things in the basement (with outside access, so we don't need to go into the main apartment), we see the christmas lights in my boyfriend's room (keeps remote for that by his bed, no where near the door) turned on and the blinds are open. A few days later we come back and the lights are off, with the windows closed.

I send a message to the roommates saying 'please stay out of our room' as politely as I can, they just deny it, claim a power surge turned in on, and the little kid accused us of ""sneaking"" (is it sneaking, looking into the window of your own room?). Now I'm super worried that they will keep going into that room before we move in, and since we rent 2 rooms, one for an office, that they will keep going in even after we move in.

These people are so unreasonable and upsetting. My boyfriend has pretty severe depression and just can't confront people especially at this time.

688,I Don't Even Know What's Wrong With Me,"Hello. You can call me Rachel even though it's not my real name. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was ten, having seen seven different therapists all except one with whom I never connected. The one I did connect with was only available for two weeks before she moved out. I cried. Each of these therapy visits have only taught me one thing and that's to never overshare or go in-depth with how I think or feel. Therapists are only in it for the job and they're only there to say ""Okay. Yes. Mhm. How does that make you feel? Why do you feel this way? What could you have done better in this situation?""

I feel like a lot of my problems come from unresolved childhood issues around school and peers, and it's shaped me into who I am today, a quiet, shy, severely emotionally repressed woman. On the inside, I'm logical and methodical. I *fucking hate* people. They piss me off a lot of times. I have intrusive thoughts that hearken back to bad memories where I was impulsive. On the outside, I'm the quietest person you would know. I've been described as very business-like where nobody would've known I was grappling with shit unless I straight-up told them. They see that I seem to handle it well when I don't got it all right upstairs. We all go through shit. Thing is, I can't tell my family or therapists what I just wrote here because they don't take well to it. They'd give me a solution to try and fix it instead of listening and helping me to feel comfortable with talking about it. They will *shame me* for what I think was simply being a child or teenager.

I have decided to call the 16yo who likes me CG

I have decided to call the sister of the 16yo PH1

And finally I decided to call the cousin PH2


They are not involved in this story, The following people who WILL be in the story:

• Me

• Therapist (Debut) 

Now time for the story: 

I FINALLY got to tell my therapist all about it and she was shocked


Me: I CAN’T BELIEVE IT, CAN YOU???

Therapist: Yes...

Me: I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN

Therapist: You can get through it, You did it once, You can do it again 

Me: .........Thanks, I really needed that 

I continued talking about it and blah blah blah blah, I eventually realise this:

Therapist: We need to find the source of you not liking this 

Me: I have the answer

Therapist: Ok...

I then tell her everything, How it started and why I’m doing it

Me: Wait a second...

Me: I have no proper reason to keep doing this.........

Therapist: It’s ok that CG likes you, Let it come and go

Me: It’s ok for her to like me, It’s ok if she steals my heart, Nothing bad will happen to me, I will always be me no matter what emotions I experience

Me: She steals my heart, So what? She can have it anyways 

And blah blah blah blah until the interesting bits

Therapist: You don’t have to find this out now, You can just stay not knowing, Can you stay for a while?

Me: Sure, I’ll do it someday but not now, I deserve a rest, I’ll go slowly today

Blah blah blah

Therapist: We’re going to need finish for today

Me: I needed this session more than any other session 

We both say bye and looking back at that memory:


PH1: “Because you’re cute”


I no longer am hurt by those words, Instead if focusing my attention onto that, I’ll let it come and go, It can’t hurt me anymore, But man, Therapist’s words gave me the strength to move forward

I seem to be going backwards and overthinking ""what have I even learnt from this"" and trying to understand what the questions I need to answer for my assignments actually want you to do, etc :/ How can I get through this a bit easier? With any set task, I go into flight or fight mode and everything gets too much.

TLDR: studying online is causing me too much stress and anxiety and wants to drop out soon. Wants to find new strategies to overcome barriers.",1582691587.0
696,Sudden sensitivity to clothes,"Around August I started to develop extremely weird and irrational hate for bras and underwear and sheets. I originally thought it was perhaps an anxiety thing and that I'd just get over it after life calmed down. It went on for a week to the point I was no longer sleeping because everything around me would wrinkle and I'd have a full blown break down. I found ways to cope and by cope I mean I avoid everything that ""triggers"" me. I talked to my therapist about it but she could only offer me breathing exercises. Because obviously it's my breathing that makes everything that touches me and wrinkles underneath me makes me want to pull my hair out. Well it keeps getting worse. My Jean's now feel too tight and constrictive. My boots felt horrible for the longest time because when I tied them they one felt tighter than the other, but now I just leave them extra loose or dont tie them. My problem is that I can't wear much now because everything feels horrible. I dont know what could help me and I dont want it to progress. No one seems to be able to help.

697,I’m broken,I’ve never been in love and I never opened up with anyone. But I met someone I fell so deeply in love and opened up so much It felt amazing.

She said she loved me more than she’s ever loved anyone yet she left me for her alcoholic ex because he begged for her to come back since he went through therapy.

700,I want to escape,"I’m currently in a position where my social life is a lot to handle. I’ve always found it pretty exhausting but right now it’s worse. I’m losing a lot of people I used to be very close to and it feels too uncomfortable and hard to take up contact again. I’m afraid I’ve lost all interest of being their close friend. Or friend at all. I dream about leaving this town and exploring something new. Being out of reach of everyone. One thing though, I have a girlfriend who I’m very in love with and attached to. We have the same network and she’s also been losing the same old friends. I don’t want to leave town if i have to be away from her.

Thinking about my old friends gives me a lot of guilt, anxiety and grief. But I would never be capable of having a relationship with them either. They seem to miss me and the sad part is that I don’t feel like I do. It makes me feel very guilty. How can someone that has mattered so much to me suddenly seem to mean nothing?

704,How to deal with narcissistic father,"For context: I’m 19, a female, still living with my father, have a younger brother, no mother (died when I was 13), and can’t get out of living situation because I go to college.

My father is a narcissist. You can’t confront him with this or else he’ll freak the fuck out. In fact, that’s all he ever does. He needs to validate himself for everything. He’s paranoid and thinks literally everyone is out to get him so he’s constantly aggressive. And I mean constantly. As in going to him on a “bad day” with a question or asking for a favor done will result in heavy sarcastic, condescending comments in where he’ll laugh at you if you ask him to speak with some decency. 

I’ve learned to live life this my entire life. He got worse when my mom died because he had no one to tell him to chill out anymore. It’s harder now that I’m in college and am constantly stressed. Any blow up he has now makes me feel stupid and worthless so I cry in my room. But that’s exactly how he wants me to feel, and I know that. But the stress paired with it is too much. 

What can I do? This might not be the subreddit to ask but I’m at a loss. I can’t just stop talking to him, we live together and I help him with a lot since he’s in a wheelchair. What do I do?",1574919265.0
705,Everything is going wrong,"I’m a freshman in college and everything has gone wrong.  I wanted to go to a community college for a year because it made college in America cheaper because I’m nowhere near rich and I’m destined for student debt. I tried to remedy that by going there to take my pre-requisites for Nursing and I also took Spanish because I wanted to minor in it. 

I was going to transfer to a actual college which is super popular in my state but then I found out that I couldn’t do that because of how difficult it was going to be just to even get in the Nursing program and because there are some many students in that school the teachers aren’t able to help and I wouldn’t get good education. I was upset because I created a whole plan for this school that I’ve wanted to go to since I was in elementary. And this summer my sister and I made a plan to move out on our own onto campus. I went to multiple advisors both at my school and the other school and found out that I was making a mistake. I had to cancel everything. 

So I decided to just work towards going to my back up school  that was smaller and had better teachers but is a private school meaning it’s more expensive. However, I had a better chance of getting into their Nursing program. 

Btw the other college was already hard enough to get into just as a freshman undergrad and people have to have a ACT score of 28 to get accepted their first year.  So most people transfer over and can get into the college itself but not necessarily the program of their study depending on how competitive it is. 

Anyway I was just going to stay at the community college for 2 years so I could get my pre-requisites for pre-Nursing to be able to get into the private colleges Nursing program as told by an advisor. 

Then today I find out that I messed up my financial aid. I wasn’t able to afford one of my classes so I had to drop it and dropped it too late so I got charged for it. Before dropping the class I let my teacher know that I wasn’t going to be able to buy my online homework code ( All of our homework and tests are online and we have to buy a code to be able to access the book and the homework along with the tests) at that moment and I had to wait until I got paid next (which turned into 3-4 weeks because of bills I have to pay) and she told me that if I didn’t have my stuff by the midterm (Mid-October) then she was going to have to fail my first quarter. 

I also I had to buy my Spanish book which was expensive too and I let him know he just extended my time. 

I just got the money to be able to buy connect codes for my classes 2 weeks ago which was a week before Midterm meaning I would’ve had to catch up on 3-5 chapters in psychology. So I dropped it because it would’ve affected my grade and I was just going to take it the next semester. 

This is where everything went wrong. During the beginning of the school year I had gotten a later class for English. It made it difficult to get home because I got out of class during rush hour making it harder and longer to get home and gas was being used up very quickly. I tried to schedule an earlier class, found out that we weren’t allowed to reschedule classes after the last registration aka the first day of school and had to go back to my 4:00 pm class. I thought I would be fine. 

Now I’m finding out that my financial aid got cut because I did that. I had been going to my financial aid at the school for a whole month and none of them told me this was the reason my financial aid wasn’t covering my bill. They kept telling me two different stories and told me it was going to drop on these certain dates or things weren’t signed when they did get signed but it wasn’t working in their program so they were emailing different people. so my mom called some other people and they finally told me what really happened. 

 Now I have to pay for my Spanish class out of pocket because it’s not part of my course of study (but I thought it was supposed to be part of a class I had to take because we have to take an arts class or a language as first year students but apparently not for me. I didn’t know that). And I also have to pay for my Psychology class out of pocket bringing my balance to  $1550 for the first semester. And I have to have it paid if I want to go to school for the second semester.

Second semester registration started on Monday and I barely even have $100 in my bank account. I’ve been trying to keep a saving account but I have to pay bills too so it would keep getting emptied out. 

Now I can’t go to school next semester and am going to work a full time job to pay my balance but I’m just really upset because everything has gone wrong. I don’t know what I’m doing and messed up everything and now I can’t go to school because I couldn’t do what I needed to do correctly and I’m upset with myself. I feel like a failure. I use to be a extremely good student in high school and was a section leader in marching band and now I can’t even attend school. And it’s not even a actual college and I’ve already messed it all up!

I’m also suffering with my mental health . My dad left our family again before I entered college. He was emotionally abusive so I was glad he left. But I was still left with the repercussions and to add college and a job that I hate to the mix has caused me to be depressed and I’ve always had anxiety. I’ve been trying to find therapist and just recently paid $126 for this months therapy sessions and I’m trying to find a therapist that is covered by my insurance so I don’t have to pay big fees. 

I’m completely devastated and embarrassed. This wasn’t supposed to happen. 

I don’t have many friends and I’ve been talking to this guy who I really like and he feels the same but I don’t even know if I should even entertain having a relationship since I’m in a bad mental state and won’t be attending school next semester. I don’t think it would be fair for him to feel burdened by my huge baggage. 

I guess it would be a distraction from everything that’s going wrong but I already know relationships will not fix my problems. It might even make it worse. And I want to be able to give him love and attention too. Depression makes it hard sometimes. 


It’s just that I feel doomed for life. It’s like things are farther and farther away from me. It’s like I’m losing everything. School, love, friends, my sanity. How much worse is it going to get! 

All I want is to be happy and get my degree so I can be a nurse practitioner. That’s all I want. I just want to succeed in life. I want to travel. But I feel like I’ve fallen into a hole that 1,000 miles underground and can’t see the light.",1572085034.0

710,How To Cope With A Drug Addict,"My friend died this month leaving behind a 50 year old son. The son has inherited the mothers home, money and stocks. Unfortunately, he is an alcoholic AND a drug addict. He has already spent all the money, sold her jewels, sold the cars and is slowly selling everything in the home. He uses any money for alcohol and drugs-either coke, crack or pills. His family -uncles, aunts, etc-has essentially walked away, urging him to sell everything and leave the state. The only thing that remains of value is the house, now tied up in probate.  That process will take 6 months to a year.

Seeing my friends hard work being squandered hurts me. That he may kill himself, or someone in the group of sharks circling might kill him, really concerns me. Ive looked in conservatorship but the fees are eye watering and out of my reach. An attorney for me, one for him AND a panel of five. Does the state want to help or make money from these cases?

I dont know what to do at this point in time. Last night I found him smoking crack while his friends snorted coke. The environment isnt safe for me and I hesitate now to visit. Others have told me to walk away but hes got no one else trying to help.

712,I don't feel like I'm good enough for anything. I have no ambition. But I feel like I'm running out of time.,"I should've appreciated my adolescence more. Made more out of it..But when I turned 14, everything in my life kind of took a nose dive. People beat the hell out of me everyday, and when I tried to confide in someone like the principal, they acted like I was lying. More than that, he blamed the bruises on my parents and said I was making up the bullying to get attention, just because he never actually saw anyone bullying me. More problems piled on. It doesn't matter anymore..All that matters is all these problems led to a shit self-image..And I spent the rest of my teen years a depressed person who never spoke a word. To anyone.

Anyway..I'm now 26, and I'm still dealing with the problems of my past. There've been a few suicide attempts. And especially this year, all I can think about is going away. Maybe not directly killing myself. Maybe just by venturing out somewhere away from people, and let come what may. I've never been happy here. Nothing has ever felt like it's gone my way. The only friends I have are the friends I visit in England, and they're the only ones that have actually been kind to me and me feel like I'm *worth* something. Most of the other people I see are just neighbors or locals in their 40s or 50s, all of which, including my family, think I'm a genius. And I guess I should think that too. I got into honor roll for six straight years, I was always an A+ student, and I graduated a year before everyone else in my highschool. I could've even made it out two years, but I felt scared about being thrust into the world. But what the fuck does that mean, anyway? That I surpassed the bare minimum in a school riddled with drug abusers who occasionally overdose in the bathroom? And so now I should be proud of myself?

I was thinking of pursuing computer science as a major. I already passed the introduction class, and now I can branch into whatever I want. I've been around computers since I was born. My whole life's spent with computers. I even finally managed to build my own after saving up from my first job. I wanted to do it since I was 14, but the money was just never there. And then there's people I meet online who've been coding and programming since they were 14, and I'm just now getting into it. So even there, I completely out of my element. Because all of this interests me, but as a kid, I was so busy moping and dealing with my depression, I just didn't do anything. And I want to learn. Knowledge is the most important thing to me in this life. But I just feel like I'm never going to be good enough. The only thing that ever made me happy was counseling other people online and fixing *their* problems.

All I do anymore is compare myself to others who have more or have done more at my age than I have. The way I feel right now is that if I can't go back and have another chance, then I just don't want to exist. I just don't feel like putting in the effort anymore. And last year, I completely fumbled at my first sales job selling smartphones. I couldn't handle the social anxiety. I feel like I'm not good enough for *anything.* Not love. Not a career. Not at socializing.",1565098002.0

714,anxious about growing up,"Basically Im a anxious human being. I get anxiety for almost everything...it makes me feel like my heart is beating so fast that it will just explode, fainty and shaky...

Nowdays i cant stop being anxious about growing up.

I always have wanted to live far away, be independent (have my own place, go grocery shopping alone, signing stuff etc., i know it seems nothing but idk why i love those kind of stuff that make me feel like an adult since i was small). During uni, I got the chance to experience them. I lived in a foreign country all by myself for like 5-6 yrs. And I always plan to live independently after Im done with uni, as soon as I get a job.

But idk nowdays i feel weird. I feel time is going fast, my parents aging. Im the youngest in the family, my parents had me quite late so my siblings and i have a large age gap. they are all well established in their job and have their own family. i feel that im so behind everyone else and ....im trying to word this correctly but i feel that i dont have much time with my family.

i miss my time with my family. everything is going so fast. my family isnt quite close with each other, but...i want to be. its just that everyone lives far away. everyone in my family has jobs that require them to travel so you cant see them much... it was the same even before i went away for uni. and i feel lonely. i feel im going to be lonely forever. i know no one lives forever, but i want them to live forever.

my parents are not so love dovey either... their saying after they retire their gonna just go away (like my dad wannna move to a different country and my mom somewhere else). im not sure if this gonna really happen. but it makes me sad. i want them be together. their not always together because of my dads job. its like my whole family is far away. ever since i was born, my siblings were away at their boarding school then uni then jobs and my dad away for his job, only saw my sibling and my dad like 2-3 times a year while i was growing up. its still the same now. i just wanna spend time together and maybe go out as a family. its been so freaking long since we all went out together. sometimes i see some of my friends family and they are all so freaking close and spend time together. and i want that too.

every time i think of this i just cry. i know is stupid but idk. i feel that if i was born earlier closer to my other siblings, then my parents would be still younger and hence more time together.

720,All of my friends have left me.,"Hello. I am a 16 year old who has recently gone through something that was really hard for me and my entire friend group. A guy in the group had hurt me, specifically he has sexually assulted me. Soon after this happened I had felt able to tell the other people in the group what had happened, and for a long time I believe that I had their support. But soon after a school sponsored trip (that they all went on, and I stayed home) I began to realize they weren't talking to me. Infact they were completely ignoring me. Finally I got contact with one of them and they told me that during the trip my abuser had the chance to tell his side of the story, and that in doing so, they all ""switched sides"" and now believe that I have been falsely accusing him. I've been completely alone this entire summer and it hurts like hell. I've lost my best friend and the rest of the group just because of this kid. I literally don't know what to do and honestly just feel horrible right now.

721,I feel like my behavior is spiraling out of control,"Ever since I was a very young kid, I’ve been extremely aggressive. I was diagnosed with O.D.D at some point but haven’t needed treatment for it for awhile but...I feel like my aggressive behavior is starting to get worse. I don’t act on violence but sometimes I do and I always feel so horrible for it afterwards. I have violent thoughts about hurting people when I get angry, but I don’t act of them. I’m afraid I’m starting to become an actual psychopath. I’m afraid to ask my mom if I can schedule an appointment with my therapist because of financial strain. I also have G.A.D and extreme clinical depression that I take meds for. I don’t blow up with people except for my sibling and mother, the people who I should be closest with are suffering because of me even though I love them and the thought of them being hurt by me makes me cry. I’m scared if my behavior continues to spiral it’ll extend to my future boyfriend, husband, and maybe even my kids. Can somebody maybe point me in the right direction or am I just too far gone?

727,Recovering from rape & rebuilding intimacy,"I’m not sure if I need advice or just someone to listen.

We are still together. He’s the one who took me to my doctor appointments after the assault occurred to make sure I was okay. It’s been about 8 months now, and I’m still having a lot of trouble being intimate with my boyfriend. Things were good recently, I was on the up, but now I feel like I’m starting to exhibit symptoms of ptsd that I haven’t had since the very beginning of my recovery. This is all incredibly hard on me, it is the worst feeling in the world not to feel comfortable in your own body, your most primal home. This is also incredibly hard on my boyfriend. I know counseling would be a good options, but I feel like if I’m forced to go before I feel ready, I am going to resent the whole situation as well as the people who pushed me to go.

736,"I'm in crisis, and I can't see a way out.","Hello, everyone. This is a new account I created to avoid unwelcome reprisals because of my story here. Please take the time to read everything, and be gentle. 

First, a bit about me. I am a white male, 29, overweight but not so bad I can't do everything. Just enough to make everything difficult. I still live at home with my parents, though not for selfish reasons. My mother is permanently disabled, and my father is suffering through chronic back pain from a poorly handled hernia that we can't afford to have dealt with surgically.

Now, my crisis. I am realizing, at this point in my life, that I'm never going to get out. And that's only part of the problem. The actual root of the problem goes back 20 years, to a time I never talk about, with anyone. But I'll be posting it here. 

My cousin, female and 4 years older than me, taught me about sex. If I'm being honest, I don't really recall how it made me feel, but I can tell you it didn't last long. She decided to stop. I was young enough that I couldn't understand (and she refused to talk about it), so I went to my little sister, the only other female I knew. And, to my everlasting regret and shame, I led her into the same abyss. By the time I had anyone actually explain what we were doing (without knowing we were doing it), we had a routine. And even though we stopped (and I hope I at least helped my sister a tiny bit by actually explaining why, and apologizing profusely), it profoundly impacted my social life. 

I avoided girls like the plague in school, because I had this twisted fear that somehow I was a deviant for being attracted to them. That I was a horrible person, who shouldn't feel the way I did. I've since realized it was bollox, but at the time it destroyed any chance I had of developing social skills. 

After high school, I convinced myself I'd moved on. I took a few years off, then went to college. I started a program in computer science, and made a couple friends. I even started cultivating a friendship with a woman I met, and was contemplating asking her out. And then my past blew up in my face. My sister, who I had believed had gotten past this as well, decided after all these years that she needed to talk to our mom about what happened. And I get it. She needed to, and I completely understand. But I was paralyzed. I thought my life was about to hit the fan. I remember having such dread that day, such paralyzing fear, that I couldn't move. I thought my parents would hate me, and they'd kick me out of the house. 

But they didn't, obviously. As I posted earlier, I'm still living with them. My mom was about as understanding as you could expect anyone to be. She didn't rage, but she was disappointed even though she insisted she wasn't. Due to the venue my sister chose to reveal this to my mom, though, my aunt learned of it as well. She's never looked at any of us the same, and she's standoffish with us in general. 

Around that time, my grandfather was living with us and in hospice as well. And it was a rocky year of hospice, which defied all expectations. The doctors had estimated he would only last a few weeks in hospice when they sent him home. So a year was a lot. And while it negatively impacted me, I must say that the hospice nurses that helped him were some of the most amazing people I have ever met. Truly amazing. But he was in pain, a lot. He had a terrible fear of dying, though, so he refused to be taken off of hospice, and the hospital refused to take him back. He'd have good nights, where he slept or watched TV, or played his Nintendo golf. But he'd have bad nights too, nights spent screaming in pain, or trying to stand and falling because he forgot he was in hospice. None of which was easy to listen to, let alone think about. 

Which, ultimately, is why I dropped out of college. I couldn't think straight, and my sleep was practically nonexistent. Even my work was suffering, and it's a mindless job. Between the hospice problems and the bombshell of my past being revealed, I was emotionally devestated. So I left college, and now I'm paying for it.

Which, finally, brings me to today. My parents make very little money, and my siblings make next to nothing. I work part time, minimum wage, at a mom and pop shop. And it's not enough. The house is falling apart, my car is practically dead already, and I'm spiraling deeper and deeper into despair. I was always told I was the smart kid. I feel like such a colossal failure, and I don't see a way to turn it around. And on the days I think maybe I could, the largest part of me knows I don't deserve to anyway. I passed on the corruption that defiled me to my innocent little sister, and part of me knows I deserve to rot for it. 

If you've made it this far, I commend you. It's not a pleasant or easy read. For what it's worth, my sister is in a better place, mentally. She is trying to get a career started, and she's motivated. She and I talk regularly, and she doesn't blame me for everything that happened, or hold it against me. She's kinder than I deserve. My cousin is similarly in a better way, as well. She is trying to turn her life around as well, and I long since forgave her for what she did. She was a very troubled teenager, at the time.",1502948078.0
737,"What if Linkin Park's music was always a cry for help from Chester, but we were all too busy relating to the lyrics to understand? Now it's too late.","I am really struggling with this whole thing.

The lyrics have given me an anger outlet; they've given me strength and hope, comfort when I felt alone, empowered me when I felt helpless. There was always a fit.

740,exboyfriend and i had a major fight last night,"hi

at a real loss right now. i'm not a danger to myself or anyone else.

last night my ex (who i live with in a 1br apt, we broke up a few days ago) and i got into a major fight when i got home around midnight. he was awake and i went to go get clothes from the bedroom we shared prior to breaking up and put on some music in the bathroom so i could shower. 
i guess i walked in on him jacking off but had no idea because he had just went into the living room moments before to get his cat to put her in the bedroom for the night with him.
so he asked me to knock in the future and i kind of brushed him off and told him i hadnt seen anything, i was just looking at my dresser to get clothes and get out, because i wasn't wanting to argue and he had tried to start a few today already over text. he also told me not to come in at midnight and play music and i told him you're awake, i don't see an issue. so i walk into the bathroom and close the door behind me and he barged in and grabbed my phone and slammed it down on the ground, effectively destroying it. i don't have any other backup phone or anything. i don't know if he's going to replace it or not. he only said he would because i grabbed his laptop and asked him how he would feel if i did the same. otherwise he said he owed me nothing and would only replace it if i paid him back.

He also slapped me on the face which triggered me to swing at him, which ended with me punching him on the side of the head. it didn't last longer than that physically. there was a lot of negativity shouted and a lot of hateful language.

we're stuck in this lease for the next year and i don't know what to do. i can't afford to move out for another 2 months due to money and he refuses to move. i'm triggered from a past relationship where almost this exact same thing happened (minus the phone busting) and i was threatened with murder while being cornered in the kitchen. i am scared of this. he has become someone i don't know and is so unpredictable. he hasn't ever threatened me like this but now its all i can think of.

unfortunately, we are a couple of gay transmen so there aren't a lot of resources available to me in such a time. i emailed a therapist at the health center i go to but without a phone, i'm sure i wont be seen immediately. like i said, i'm not a threat to myself or anyone else, i'm just having panic attacks and am scared of being at home with him because of previous experiences.

if he does not follow through with replacing my phone i will be contacting his parents, who pay his half of our rent. i took pictures of my phone with my manual camera just in case. 

i have to go to work now but i haven't been able to sleep. i'm going to try and take a half day so i can come back and try to separate our belongings as much as possible and get some sleep while he isn't here.

741,Just found out my long distance boyfriend has a family....through social media. I'm a mess.,"I'm currently shaking and sobbing so I'm sorry if this is all over the place. 

About a year ago, my best friend from high school and I started dating. He was in the military, but his status changed from active Duty to reserve. Things were great, it was hard because of the distance, but we both seemed committed to making it work.... Until Sunday. 

He works at a sport store, and does a lot of physical labor, so he's exhausted. Sometimes so tired he doesn't get to text me. That's fine. We've been through 3 deployments, not talking every day isn't the end of the world. Our last conversation was on Sunday. He had told me earlier that week since summer's around the corner, he'll be really busy. But I send him texts everyday, just a simple good morning/night, I love you sort of thing. Today is no different. 

I miss seeing his face though, so I go check his Instagram. And lo and behold. His 2 most recent photos are of him and this girl.... And a child. Sleeping. Together. With his arms wrapped around both of them. Her comment on it was ""i think this is my favorite photo of us so far <3""

I message him, just asking what's up. He sees my message (it shows the read receipts) and doesn't reply. He doesnt answer my texts, my calls go straight to voice-mail. 

I ask my friend to check out his Facebook (I deleted mine ages ago), and his relationship status says he's dating Instagram baby mama. It was 2 days before my birthday, which was last weekend. 

I don't know what to do. I had cried earlier, but now I'm just numb and empty. Everything was just a lie. I'm left here questioning everything that happened r years ago in high school. Every moment we shared, all the things we said, the promise I made to him never to cut again, how he made me promise never to hurt myself either. To stay alive for him. 

I'm devastated. Please help.

742,I am going to kill myself sometime this month.,"I don't know what to do. I am a 39 year old woman and I don't see any other way out.

A year ago, I had a fantastic job at a ""mom-and-pop"" business. It paid well, it nourished my creative artistic side, and I had every reason to believe it was going to last until retirement. I had no kids, no responsibilities other than myself. My boss was a father figure to me (my parents have both passed away some years ago) and my co-workers were my family.

Then my boss died very suddenly. He was only in his fifties. He had told us several times that he had a will that left the business to us employees, if anything were to happen to him. His ex-wife showed up the day after the funeral, and completely expected to take over the business. Ha ha, we thought. She had been a bitch to us when they were married so we ignored her setting up an office in our storage closet. She went to her lawyer and got everything. Apparently the divorce wasn't 100% final when he died, so she now owns the business and kicked everybody out - even the workers that had been there since the 70s. I live in an ""at-work"" state so there is no recourse. The business is now going rapidly downhill as the woman has never held a job before in her life, but that's not a comfort after all the work we put in to make it a success. That was a year ago. All the other employees have disappeared, I haven't been able to find where they moved to. I have no other friends.

I was stupid about future planning and had no savings. I could not afford to keep renting my nice house or leasing my nice car, so I gave it up, sold everything I had to sell, and eventually had to move in with my aunt or else be homeless. She said that to do that I'd have to give up drinking and smoking, which I did, cold turkey.

There are no jobs. There is absolutely nothing within walking distance, or even biking distance. Online I haven't found anything that makes more than a dollar an hour or so.

My aunt treats me like her slave. When I moved in the house was a mess (she is a hoarder, but not of anything worth money) and I cleaned for both our sakes. It took several days. Now she expects nothing less than absolute cleanliness everywhere, and I'm talking every window better be sparkling, every floor better be mopped, every light fixture had better be dusted and polished, the oven had better be scrubbed on a daily basis. It doesn't matter if it's clean, she wants it done again every day. I also do all the cooking, and pay for the groceries with my EBT card.

She is incontinent and I have to launder her nasty smelly bedclothes every day, by hand in the bathtub because she doesn't have a washing machine. She takes insulin shots and is ""scared"" she can't do it herself properly, so that's something I have to do. She also insists that I bathe her and wash her hair. She has other children, but they don't ever come around or even call. She has applied for home health care, but the government apparently doesn't see her diabetes as that serious.

She has a crappy car that she allows me to use to drive her to and from church functions, of which there are many, where she insists I attend (I'm an atheist, but if she knew that she'd throw me out). She likes to brag to her church friends that I was a sinner who was drinking and smoking, and good for nothing, but she took me in out of the goodness of her heart. The only times I am permitted to use the car is when she is with me - groceries, gas station, doctor's office, church. Those are literally the only places I've been all year.

On top of all this any small amount of money that I do get (from selling my things online, or for getting a Fiverr bid to do some small data entry) goes directly to her pocket. She knows everybody at the bank where I have my account (it's a small credit union, she's been a member for decades) and she went to them and put her own name on my account without my permission so she can draw out money ""just in case of emergency"". My account is always empty soon after I put any money into it, and I can't go draw it out in cash because I have to drive there. I got $200 a month for the first six months thanks to unemployment, but those checks went to ""bills"" and now they are gone, probably in her private account that I don't have access to. I asked the bank manager if I could quietly take her name off the account, he said no that would have to be something she signs an agreement for. It would piss her off anyway, she would kick me out, so I gave up on the idea.

I have tried discussing these things with her but it always ends in a screaming match about how ungrateful I am, and how I can walk out of her house at any time if life is so terrible.

In the past year I have no friends - I am not allowed to have anyone over to the house - I have no cell phone (LifeLink gave me one but she keeps hold of it at all times for ""health emergencies""), I have this rinky dink slow computer that she knows how to check the history on because she's afraid I'm watching porn.

tl;dr I am stuck here, in this tiny town without any public transportation, having what little funds come in sucked away by a hag. I can't get out. I want out. I don't want to hurt my aunt but she'll be okay without me. I don't have anyone who will miss me.

749,My friend called me special needs and said that's why her parents don't like me as much.,"My (24f) best friend (24nb) and I had a long talk last night.

for background, I have cptsd, depression, and anxiety due to events that left me orphaned at a young age. in high-school, my best friend Kat and I met, her parents sort of took me in as a daughter- made sure I was taken care of while they could. however I've always had a very hard time connecting with them....I'm horrible with parental figures. I get uncomfortable wheb treated like a daughter.

there were also some times where, before I was medicated, I had some loud outbursts and bad reactions to stuff. I'm now medicated and have the skills to no longer have those reactions. but at that time her parents had to deal with me.

I'm now living alone, and somewhat struggling. My bestie and I have been talking about moving in together- but nothing was set.

I have no savings, loans to pay off that I had to take to keep afloat, and bad life skills that I'm trying to really work on

Kat has a friend, Angel (26 i think?), who came out of a bad, but not as physically and emotionally abusive as mine (not saying her situationwasnt bad, just that the situations were different), household. Kats family took her in.

kats family LOVES Angel. they take her places and pay for things and talk to her all the time, invite her out, pick out clothes for her- all of that

now Angel wants to get a place, but she wants a roommate. she doesn't need one- she would be more than fine by herself from what I've heard-

but Kats family is pushing for Kat to live with her...they aren't even considering me.

I asked Kat just why Angel was treated so differently....and what she said just....made me so damn mad

she said it's because Angel isn't special needs like I am

Kat has her fair share of mental and physical needs as well, that fall outside of Angel's ""normal"" Kat is far from neurotypical and her medications prevent physical violence towards herself and other, it's not like she's less of a 'special needs' case than I am

so I'm also mad at her parents...they've taken care of me in the past...but they've made no effort to understand me even when, now that I'm medicated, I've been trying to make efforts myself.

I guess it's too late for me to connect with them....I was too misbehaved as a teen. I never did drugs or broke the law or anything dangerous- but my personality was shit anyway. and that ruined my only chance at a family

if only I wasn't ""special needs"" I guess.",1679063539.0

752,Vulnerability in relationships,"Why is it necessary? How is it useful? 

I absolutely HATE it. When I start to feel like I'm being pushed into a vulnerable spot I get angry and defensive. I've also ended past relationships because I felt vulnerable. My brain just screams to me that it's a danger zone to be avoided at ALL times no matter the cost. 

Logically and realistically I know I can't live a healthy life without it though. I know I can't keep close friends or really any relationship of any kind, if I'm not willing to be vulnerable with others. 

All of that being said, I have managed to maintain a nearly 8 year relationship with a really wonderful guy. He deserves nothing but the very best because he's given me nothing but the best. I want to become a better person and a better partner for him but I just don't know how to.

757,I don’t like living with my mom anymore. Should I ask her to leave?,"Hey y’all. I’m a 24 year old and I’m having problems w my mum. So me and my partner were looking for a place to moved into in the beginning of this year. During this time, my mum was also looking for a place. Reasons: she was having issues with her own mum. 

Fast forward: My partner(25) found a place. A 4 bedroom place for all of us. Me and my partner one room and my mum (45) occupying 3 because of my two (1 (20) other( 11) ) siblings. Everything was ok at first. But it all changed ones my mum started to complaint about my partner. She complained about any little thing like “he left the closet open” to then complaining about anything and everything. My sister would also complaint about him and she would tell my mum things about my partner. Which I later found out that my sister did it because she was jealous. (“Jealous that he spends so much time with me and she can’t have me”) I found it dumb because my sister doesn’t even look for me like that..so? What is there to be jealous of? Anywho, My mum “recognized” it. But as time continued, she would still complaint and blame my partner for anything/everything. She even said “why can’t he take us all out and pay for all of us”. And I find it unfair. Me and my partner are used to spending only for us two. But paying for an extra adult and “two kids” is too much for us when one of us is a full time college student.
Ever since we all moved in, we have provided nearly everything. We have them a lot of hygienic products that we had, all the appliances are ours, we would buy groceries for all of us, every time we need someone to come over to install something or fix something we have to ask our work for permission because my mom doesn’t even want to do that. 
I’ll give an example of things she complaints about. We had come up with an agreement of cleaning days. My oldest brother cleans ones a week and me the end of the week. My brother has no job or does school. So he’s home all day. I clean on weekends because I work full time and do school. But I noticed when I cleaned that I was deep cleaning a lot. Sometimes I would noticed some things untouched/clean. But why are they untouched/unclean if my brother cleans? So I’m fed up that I clean for all of us while they don’t clean everything. I have a lot of things going on but they don’t. My mum then complaint and said “we’ll your partner does clean” to which I responded “he may not clean but I clean for both of us. He’s at work and he’s not gonna stop working to clean”. And I find it ironic that she’s commenting on such thing when she doesn’t clean at all. From these past months we’ve been living together I’ve seen her clean at least once or twice out of the 6 months living here. The excuse she’s given me is “I work a lot” she works night shift, 5 days a week. Weekends being off like me. But instead she goes out to clubs and parties. She has time to go out but not to help. 
She’s made me feel bad about me and my partner and it’s been affecting my mental health drastically. It often feels like I’m the mother because of the way she acts. There’s so much more into the situation but it’s a lot for me type. Plz anyone..what would you suggest?",1663693101.0
758,The world is unfair and I feel helpless.,"It started when I was sad the last few times. I called my mom and she told me at some point „i don’t want to say this but imagine going through a hospital. I’m sure they would all want to switch with your life.“ 

So now whenever i started being sad i thought of news or true crime podcasts, where the worst things happened. A girl was sold for 600 $ in Iraq to some old man. Another was raped by a group of 5…things like that. And now I get even sader because I feel so awful and helpless for what’s happening in their life. And here I am. A 25 year old woman crying about their stupid ex. I can’t cry about that anymore. Now I feel bad all the time because all the time much worse things happen to other people. I don’t know what to think anymore. Also my grandma said her life wasn’t great and she wouldn’t want to life backward if she got the chance. And that broke me too. 

At this point and I know what the point is anymore. Life is awful most of the time and then you die. Great.

764,I just left an emotionally abusive friendship with someone with BPD.,"I have a lot to say, but I want to put a disclaimer out there that not everyone who has Borderline Personality Disorder is like this, nor are they as manipulative and harmful as this person is. I just wanted to share my story because it is extremely important to recognize when to speak out or step away. 

I had a four year long friendship with a close friend who was textbook BPD. She was recklessly promiscuous from an early age, binge ate herself into pre-diabetes, self-harmed, formed extremely close and dependent attachments to people whereupon she would discard them if they failed to live up to her expectations. She habitually stole from stores, had extreme mental breakdowns, would lash out at people, become passive-aggressive, and had an overall “my way or the highway” attitude. All of her personality was ripped and adopted from the latest trends/people she idolized/social media. She had an excessive need for validation and attention.

The way these traits manifested were much more obscure (sans the breakdowns) than you’d expect. She was black and diagnosed with ADHD, which she used many, many times to leverage herself in a way that made people out to be the bad guy. If you were upset with a particular way that she spoke to you or treated you, she would often use the excuse, “I’m sorry, I’m a black woman. That’s just how I talk,” after saying something offensive or rude. If she didn’t want to play a particular video game or watch a movie with our shared friend group, she would throw a tantrum and derail it, making things tense and awkward. Her excuse for that was usually, “I have ADHD so it’s difficult to focus my attention on one thing.” When I spoke out about this, I was attacked by her best friend who would tell me that I was being ableist. 

She had formed a very strong attachment to me in particular. We met online on an obscure website circa 2016. At the time, because of the small size of the website, I was popular. I was also 14 and questioning my gender identity, and thought I was trans at the time. She formed a massive crush on me and would argue with other girls or friends of mine online. This, along with her other behavior, caused her to be heavily cyberbullied on that site. Before I left the website in late 2018, I sent her a message apologizing for being cruel to her the way that I did at times due to her clinginess and erratic behavior. She thanked me and asked to stay in contact with me. Since I felt bad about the way I had treated her and wanted to turn a new leaf, I gave her my Instagram handle and phone number. 

It was downhill after that. We became very close in 2018-2020 with cyclical fights. She often brought up the way I had treated her when I was 14-16. She also talked about how she would bang her head against her headboard while talking to her boyfriend about me because she felt like she was, “always fucking things up,” with me. She said that she’d looked up to me and felt that she could never please me or be enough for me. She also felt that I was much more intelligent than she was and that she couldn’t understand much of what I would discuss with our friends, which led her to feel stupid and left-out. She would also often project onto me by saying that she felt as if she had to walk on eggshells around me because I would be a little upset if she said something offensive.

Many of our mutual friends would have her side over mine to keep the peace because she had a way of demanding people be behind her. Her argument skills were strong and often included screaming and breaking down/sobbing. I carried that with me for years, believing myself to be ableist, to be condescending or overly judgmental. It wasn’t until I started dating my boyfriend that I realized the behavior wasn’t normal or healthy. 

My boyfriend would point out ways that I was being degraded and humiliated, find flaws in her logic, and correct the things she had led me to believe about myself. My closest friend is also her close friend who often acted as a mediator. That friend has many of their own personality and mental health struggles, so when it came to arguments, their judgment was sometimes skewed to favor hers due to their relation to her struggles. 

I am still healing from six years of constantly walking on eggshells and feeling as if I were obligated to stick with her after multiple attempts of breaking it off. Whenever I tried, she would breakdown again. I had lost all sympathy after many times and tried to convey how exhausting it was. She even recognized this, yet did little about it. 

I want to state again that BPD is not a blanket experience for everyone, and this friend was an extreme case. I do want to highlight, however, that it can be covert when conflated with societal issues regarding race, sexuality, and mental health. I myself share some similar experiences as a mentally ill queer woman, but I think it’s important to talk about how some people in our communities use their identities to excuse harmful behavior. This is not to dismiss the very real injustices that queer people, mentally ill people, and BIPOC experience. This behavior is a minority to say the least, but it’s a very real one, and it’s harmful to those experiencing actual struggle.

Please, please, please try to step away if you think you’re dealing with someone like this in your own life. It may seem small, but it will suck the life out of you. Your self-esteem, self-image, perception of reality, and mental wellness can be absolutely crushed. Having to relearn myself and my relationships is a jarring process that I am continuously working on and improving. Please get the help you need, and get out of this verbally/emotionally abusive relationship ASAP. You deserve love, kindness, and confidence in your relationships. Feel free to comment or DM with any questions if you feel like you need someone to confide in. I love y’all.",1659506883.0
765,How do I deal with not knowing if he is alive or dead?,"I (F29) broke up with my ex (M31) of over a year about 5 months ago. 

When we were together he broke up with me a lot, during arguments, and would always saying things like I'd never see him again, and he'd make it impossible for me to contact him (change jobs, change house, delete his number etc). The worst thing he could do to me would be to block me and he knew that. I'd always beg for him back and we'd stay together. Eventually I just said ""ok"" and left him when he broke up with me. He said he wasn't leaving me and I said I was, and we broke up.

We got back together a few days later for another 6 weeks because he threatened to kill himself. He went into a lot of detail about how he would do it, he said it was due to low job prospects, his race and place in life, serious family trauma etc. He said he had tried before after his ex left him because she'd made him feel worthless and then he had to go through heartbreak and he'd promised himself he'd never go through heart break again, and me leaving him was causing this to happen.

He always said that he wanted me to walk away, not look back and just move on. Go travelling and that I then wouldn't know if he was dead or alive. Obviously I responded that this was crazy and I could never do that. He would give me full scale panic attacks whilst telling me about how he would die and I'd beg him not to, to please get help while he'd be really calm. Occasionly he broke down fully in tears if he got to a point of doubting his plan. He started drinking straight vodka and taking risky supplements that are high risk of cancer etc. He said it stopped him feeling so much.

Eventually we had an argument after he told his baby sister it was partially my fault he was going to die and he turned on me, blamed me for him wanting to die, said I was evil, that his death was on my hands, that he hoped I never did this to anyone else because they would kill themselves too. That he'd lied about the reasons and it was because I was abusive and I'd pushed him to open up too soon and because I was horrible to him. He said if I'd loved him he would live.. he ran away and the next day he ended up saying goodbye to everyone, taking some pills (he took 8, he needed 45 but he always said 2 or 3 would kill him and idk if he believed that or not) whilst on the phone with me  and telling me he hoped I always suffered as he died. I had him sectioned and he was fine, taken to hospital, released within 12 hours and sent home. 

He told his best friend to block me and never forgive me etc. He told everyone I was awful and had made him suicidal. His flatmates said I must have just got on his last nerve and they thought he was in the right (I think they thought he beat me up even though he never did). He then texted me begging me to come back, and when I said no he screamed at me that it was my fault he was suicidal. I said no one else can make someone kill themselves and he screamed that I could and I did and it was 100% on me. I walked away and he broke down and said I wwas abandoning him. A week later he got his sister to text me repeatedly saying he was going to die today and it was my fault etc. I ignored it with the help of his best friend who was keeping me secretly updated. His best friend also believed my ex might kill himself but he didn't know what to do or think. He promised to tell me if anything happened and said it wasn't my fault. He was a big support for me and helped me not go crazy with worry.

His best friend blocked me a month ago with no warning. I managed to message and he said this:

""Hey OP , everything is okay with EX don't worry , his moving on and I hope you are too . 

Sorry for not messaging I had to block you , EX kept asking me if I was still speaking to you and if I have blocked you .. I couldn't keep lying to him"". 

He then ignored my reply. 

 My ex has deleted all social media. I have no way of contacting him, he's changed number. I have no idea if he's still alive. 

I live in the same town as him. I drive past his work and home a lot. Everytime I see someone that looks like him (he's black) my heart skips a beat. Everytime I drive near his work or home or his parents home I feel sick. Everytime I see an ambulance I feel sick. His friends hate me and if they see me they would refuse go back to him and say how I'm unattractive or dressing badly or a ""downgrade"" etc. It makes me really self conscious. I don't know if he's alive or dead. He always said he would make it so I wouldn't know. He also knows I have extreme anxiety and abandonment issues from a previous abusive relationship and this is literally my worst nightmare. I've had 2 people close to me kill themselves in the last 3 years and he knows this. 

My mum keeps asking every few days about him, telling me how he's proof that no one can stand to be around me etc (I don't get on with her for obvious reasons) and asking if I've spoken to him at all and how he's such a good guy amd can't we get back together (she knows he threatened to kill himself because I left). My friends all think he must have mental health problems due to a difficult childhood and that we were just toxic as a couple and to just move on and get over him as we are no longer together,  it's not my problem.

No one seems to understand that I CAN'T. I can't figure out how much I am to blame. I can't figure out what I keep doing to make people abusive to me. I can't figure out if he's straight up abusive and deliberately doing it or if he really does think he's the victim and I'm somehow abusive and if he really is struggling and I walked away and abandoned him. I can't even hate him in peace because I keep getting into cycles of suddenly thinking he might be dead and it wasnt his fault he just had undiagnosed mental health issues. Or worse, I did push him to open up too soon (I did because he was such a closed book i basically said incouldnt be with someone that couldnt be vulnerable with me) and that this caused him to kill himself. If he is dead all his friends and his family and my family will blame me. It sounds crazy but they will. Even though I haven't done anything other than move and we had a a few arguments when we were together. 

I can't get over the panic that he might be dead. He told me I wouldn't be allowed at the funeral. He told me I was to blame. He told me I would never find out if he did die. I worry that the reason his best friend blocked me was to spare my feelings so I wouldn't know because I'd never forgive myself. It makes me want to throw up thinking about it and I can barely contain my panic and stop myself driving to his house and banging on the door to see if he's there, but his flatmates would not let me in and then if he is alive he would realise his tactics still work and either paint me as crazy or drag me back in with threats of suicide and guilt tripping again. Or if he is dead his flatmates would yell at me that I'm to blame and maybe even get physical if they got angry enough. 

I'm in therapy and it's helping with some stuff but it's not enough. How do I deal with the anxiety and the anger and resentment and confusion? I really need to talk about it and work out what the truth is but no one wants to listen. And even if they did, theres no one who would actually care. I feel like all my friends are sick of hearing about it. My family blame me and dont care.

766,I know well.. this is a random request. I never posted before so... I'll try.,"I want to be there for people. Be someone's friend, and change people. I also want to learn sign language it would be fun to be friends with anyone who has any issue. My hope is to be there for people, for someone to lean on. Life is cruel and I've been bullied all my life, cause I was different. And I want to be there for people, that think they are different and don't deserve what ""normal"" people have... I want, no I wish I can be a friend to anyone so they can have someone to lean on and trust....  


         Life is still hard for me, I get bullied all the time from the disabilities I have that make me different to everyone else. I have breathing issues so I cant run much, I have scoliosis so I'm in pain all the time, and well... I'm going deaf and I'm worried about it. My hearing has been fainting for the past few years. And its been hard always not hearing anything or what someone has said, and I need to constantly repeat ""what is that"", or even sometimes get a book to ask them to write on it to read what they said...  


        But even though I don't trust anyone, I saw someone else get hurt from another today... And it made me realize that maybe others are going through even worser things. And I want to be there for someone, because no one was there for me. I want someone that I can trust and someone who can trust me when I get to know them at least.

My anxieties stop me doing pretty much anything that I SHOULD be doing. I still live at home with my ageing parents. I have no license. I find dating difficult and have never been in a serious relationship. I simply just don't see my life ever moving forward? I don't know where to start, or what to do. The more I stay shut away, the harder it gets yet I just don't know what to do to change it? When I try anything, I get shut down. When I get a push to apply for a job, if I get a call for an interview, I panic and can't bring myself to do it. I am too nervous to date after some bad experiences. I don't think I'll ever have the money to ever move out or do my own thing. Don't want this to come across as 'woe is me' I know many people have it so much harder. I'm lucky to have a roof over my head, and to have family who care, but I simply wont have this forever. I have literally done the same thing every day for 8 years since leaving school.

I don’t know if anyone else feels like this but I can go on for weeks without talking to anyone. I think It’s a really bad habit I picked up as a child when my parents would give me the silent treatment whenever I misbehaved - there would be whole weeks where not a single word was spoken in my home and I’ve gotten used to it I think. And for a long time (I’m currently 22), none of my friends have ever had a problem with the fact that I only leave my house or socialize every once in a while. It wasn’t until I met this girl a couple of years ago that it really hit me how not normal it is for me to be so closed off.

maybe it's me, maybe I'm pushing everyone away but idk why or how, I'm rlly conscious abt how I act around others and what i say, maybe it's because of my obsession with things that normal ppl don't do, I'd consider myself a hardcore tech enthusiast and I get picked on at school for being ""a nerd"" no one likes me because of that.

771,My friends ignore and disrespect me,"Hey. I don't really know where to start with this but it's just been too overwhelming for me for a while now. i have a friend group of 4 girls in my class. We have known one another for 4 years. We all used to be close but something changed this year. I'm naturally an introvert, a good listener, i tend to give the word to others first without ever saying bad stuff to anyone. I was always there for them and helped them as much as i can but now they seem like they have forgotten everything. The girl that sits next to me, let's call her A, doesn't talk to me anymore (she only talks to me when she has no choice not to, when it happens to be just the two of us..) and when she's telling a story she doesn't even look at me, it's like she's only talking to the others but not me. Not even sharing stuff to me anymore. It makes me think that she got tired of me and simply finds talking to me boring. I've always defended her and stayed by her side even when she was at her worst. Never said a word against her. I was closest to her and we had the best moments together. I think that me being kind annoys all of them for some reason. Then there is this super extroverted girl, imma call her B, she goes to parties a lot, always has stories to tell and likes to talk shit about people. Her toxic energy and tough ""i don't give a fuck about anything"" manner somehow managed to drawn the other girls towards her. They think of her as interesting, they admire her and all she does is she never shuts up. She just radiates that pick me energy. Makes me think they are afraid to ever speak up against her or have a different opinion from hers. My gut feeling tells me that she has probably talked shit about me to the others and that's the reason they changed their behavior towards me. I've also noticed that she never talks directly to me. Maybe she has sensed that i can see her for who she truly is, hiding behind her mask. I started going to school with a negative mindset that every day is the same. I just quietly sit on my desk and stay on my phone. She's there talking super loud, they listen to her with ears wide open. I'm not even kidding, this girl never shuts her mouth. Most of what she's talking about is herself. All the time. My damn head hurts like hell every day after school cause she sits right behind me. I gave up engaging in these conversations. They consist mostly of gossiping and inside jokes. Whenever i try to say something i get either ignored or talked over. They completely exclude me from conversations as if im not there. I've tried multiple times to participate but they just don't do anything to include me. I'm really pissed off and it just gets worse and worse. Today we had a math test and i talked about one of the answers and she literally looked at me and said ""Oh you're finally talking🤣"". I stopped immediately, just looked at her with a deadly stare and turned my back. Didn't speak for the rest of the day. I'm so sick of all her manipulative tactics, they just don't work on me. So, basically, every time i try to talk, girl A and girl B always find a way to bring me down.. Why is this happening, what can i do about it? I can't just leave and find new friends cause im sitting next to them. Plus, being in this class for 4 years now, all the friend groups have been formed. I'm basically stuck with them until we graduate next year. I can't stand this one more year. I also can't share this with anyone, i feel like y'all reddit people would understand me the best<3
(P.S. I didn't mention girl C in the story, just because she has always been a good girl, such a sweetheart with so much potential, it's just that girl B considers her as her best friend and sort of thinks she possesses or maybe gatekeeps her to herself only, so i don't have the chance to talk to her throughout the day...)

773,Ex-Fiance has sex with me while he thinks I'm asleep... I need help/advice.,"Hi, I'm (30F) new to Reddit, please forgive my mistakes, I am just really desperate to share or talk to someone about what is happening to me and I cannot share it with anyone in my life.

So, for background I had been dating this guy, let's call him John (32M), for about 6+ years. I recently broke up with him because it seems like he has changed into a person that I don't recognize anymore and he kept breaking promises, lying and hiding things from me. 

When we started dating he was honestly THE best and sweetest guy. He helped me cope during a difficult time in my life, he supported me, he protected me, he made me feel exceptionally special and I was drawn to him quickly in a romantic way once he verbally made it clear that he was interested in me. The first few years were absolute bliss and I was elated that I had found someone who seemed to care and love me so much. I was in heaven.

Over the course of our relationship, we got engaged and later moved in with his parents (he insisted it would be fine - it was not fine) 
His parents despised me and I only found out the day after we got engaged. They were enraged and his mother said that I didn't deserve him. I was crushed. I moved out soon after and crashed at a friend's house.
As time progressed things got harder for my fiance and I but we decided to move far away from our hometown to start fresh, just the two of us. I was so happy because I thought that was the beginning of our new life together.

After two years of living together things slowly started going down hill... He stopped helping out with the domestic chores. At first I just thought he was overworked and that he needed a break, so I took over his share of the chores too, so I was taking on all of the cleaning, cooking and taking care of our pet's needs etc.
He stopped paying attention to me in a general sense, and basically we got to the point where we could be in the same room for hours just coexisting without speaking a word to each other. I was confused and sad but chalked it up to ""he must be stressed out"", but started noticing that the only time he touched me physically was when he wanted sex. 

I admit that I became clingy. I tried to please him in any way I could think of with the hope of rekindling our bond. It didn't work. He became more distant...except when he wanted to touch me sexuallly or to have sex. I don't know why I went along with it. At some point I broke down crying and asked him if something was bothering him, or if he had lost interest in me or met someone else. He denied everything and said that it wasn't a big deal and that he felt stressed from work but he loves me and that we're just going through a little bit of a rough patch. He promised to change and be more present, and help out around the house. He helped out for a week or two and stopped again... 

Skipping forward... I reached a point where I decided that I would be better off alone than to be in a relationship where I felt like an unappreciated housewife / human fleshlight even before we were married.
 
I broke up with him. He was upset but said that he understood why I chose to end the relationship and that he was sorry his behavior. We decided that we would still live together till we could each find alternative housing and that we could remain friends. At that point in time I made it CLEAR verbally that I do not want to engage in sex anymore after the break up, as I wanted to do sexual healing and therapy. He agreed and said that he supported me and my decisions.

After a while I started having ""sex dreams"". It became a weekly thing but I brushed it off... Till one night I woke up and he was.. Inside of me. He was having sex with me. I started moving and then he stopped and quickly pulled out and waited for me to settle again... I pretended to be asleep, and he penetrated me again and continued having sex me. I froze. I didn't know what to do. I started staying up at night and kept busy to avoid sleeping. He noticed and suggested that we look into getting sleeping pills so that I could get some rest and that it was unhealthy for me lose so much sleep. I half agreed but told him that I was worried about forming an addiction to the pills and tried changing the subject whenever he mentioned it. So I started  sleeping on the couch, and when he questioned me I said that I had ""fallen asleep on accident"". I got away with it for a bit but he became visibly annoyed after a while, so I caved and started ""sleeping"" in the bed again. 
He began having sex with me again, and this kept happening over the course of a month, and I became very depressed, physically drained and it felt like I was going crazy... I didn't know how to confront him, but one morning I asked him straight up ""did you have sex with me last night?"" he blatantly denied it, and that's when I told him that I woke up while he was inside me and that I didn't know how to confront him at that time and that's when he admitted to it and that he's sorry and that he just couldn't help himself and that it would never happen again (I didn't tell him that I was aware of all the other times, don't know why). 

It's been two weeks. He just had sex with me again while he thought I was asleep. I waited for him to fall asleep and I am currently sitting in a locked bathroom bawling. I have no money to my name because we own a little business that we started together but he stopped paying me a salary a while back because the business was slowing down but he always bought me the essentials that I needed each month so I went along with it. And so I can't just pack up and leave right away, I've been looking for a job in another city, so I am planning on getting away when I get the chance.

I know that I hold all of the blame for allowing things to happen the way it did and that I'm a fucking idiot for not leaving sooner. The thing is, I know that what happened is wrong, it's just he doesn't seem to understand how wrong it is. He brushes it off and goes on with his day, and it kind of rubs off on me because it's like I too become rather meh over it all and keep questioning myself IF it really is wrong. Its back and forth in my head. I blame myself, I blame him. I hate him for what he's done to me, yet at the same time I feel so much for him it kills me to think of moving away and not speaking to him but it feels like my body wants to run away. I should leave, I know. And I will soon. 

I don't know what advice I'm seeking exactly. I think I just needed to get it out of my system, tell someone, anyone. Kind of feels Ike I need confirmation that I'm not overreacting or, I think I need validation or an explanation.. I'm sorry, my fucking brain is fried at this point Im feeling so hopeless.",1653267612.0

I know you could argue that I'm only 16 (turning 17) and that I should seek medical help but I've been scared from that shit because all through out school I was just told I'm faking it and I should just fuck off and get a grip and even to the point the counsellors I've had have just turned around and ignored me. like yes I do have big goals in life such as my music and editing but I find it so fucking hard to even cope in that shit like I jsut feel like I'm not good enough and even people I love and who are close to me ahve just told me to get a better job but I can't like my anxiety fucking kills itself around a wide amount of people.

I feel like my relationship is just going to shit too like I just feel like I'm boring her and pushing her away and fuck I hope I don't but I really jsut don't see the point in living anymore and if I told her that it'd break her it'd break her even more if I go but I'm jsut really sinking down deeper than I've ever been and I really jsut don't see an easier way into life than just to kill myself.

I just really want to feel like old me without feeling like a fucking disapointment to everyone I love and even to me. the doctors did try to prescribe me with meds for my anxiety but It just made me 10x worse and I've resulted to codiene and anti depressants jsut too feel something but the thooght of killing msyelf jsut keeps getting worse as the days go on to the point I'm deadass on the verge of flipping a coin and if it gives the answer I wants I'll jsut do it.

784,How do I cope with the likely probability that free will doesn't exist?,"Sorry if this post is a mess but I need other people's opinions on this.  
Recently I've been thinking about our universe and going by how physics works, it's overwhelmingly likely that free will doesn't exist, and I just can't get it out of my head. If everything is governed by the laws of physics, that means that humans are as well, and that means that at the end of the day humans don't make choices, we are just chemicals that tricked ourselves into thinking we are. Whether you look at the universe deterministically or not (quantum randomness), the fact is that I myself (if ""myself"" truly exists, and not just some particles thinking I do) didn't have any part in it, everything I've done with either always going to happen or just randomly happened as a continuation of past events, with no reason to it. 

The only ways I can see this not being true are the existence of a divine entity that bestowed humans free will (which I can't really reconcile with my views) or that humans have some way of altering quantum probabilities with their consciousness, which seems really unlikely.

My story feels like it's already written or out of my control, and all my dreams and ambitions don't matter because what happens to me is just some outcome of a random number generator basically.  If I'm doomed to a fate I won't like there is nothing I can do about it, and if it does end up favorably for me did I really do anything or did I just meaninglessly get lucky.

785,Can you help me to understand my feelings?,"Hello to everyone!
I'm currently working two days a week (due to personal reasons I dropped off university and I will start a new bachelor in October). My job consist in help a middle school child with his homework. 
The workplace is the boy's house, really far away from my home (almost 1 h and 30 minutes). 
They pay me only €10 per hour (three hour  in a day so 3 hours of bus travel that cost me 10€) but I need to gain some money during that gap year. 
My problem is that I feel really uncomfortable. 
The boy's family try to treat me ""as a friend"", that really put me in discomfort (I'm not their friend, nor I want to be), they are really aggressive with the child, they frequently scream at him (thats pretty scary), and also the child (I don't want to put the blame on  him, cause its only twelve) is disrespectful (for example last week I ask him ""How are you?""

786,What would you put in a “depression resource kit”?,"What would you put in a depression resource kit?

Like many, I’ve suffered with depression in the past. Back then, I really didn’t have the energy to help myself a whole lot. I was lucky that my partner persevered with me and helped me. These days, I see more and more people struggle with depression (colleagues, friends, relatives) but the advice I give them: “go see a doctor / psychologist”, “get a mental health plan” etc. isn’t always helpful to someone who doesn’t have the motivation (or a close support person around them) to help find a suitable health professional, figure out if they can afford it etc.

I was pondering creating a “depression resource kit” that I can donate to people when they look like they could do with a bit of help  with their mental health - but I’m not sure what to put in it?

Existing online options seem to focus on alternative therapy stuff like head massagers, a acupressure rings, herbal teas etc. 

I don’t know what I was expecting. Maybe some uplifting books by people who’ve been through it, or maybe vouchers for healthy food prep services, lists of local mental health professionals with details on their services / pricing. Reflecting on when I was going through it as a twenty-something male, these are some things that may have helped me.

But everyone is different and there’s no right answers - which is why I was just wondering…

TL;DR: what would you like to see in a “depression resource kit” if someone gave you one as a tool to help with depression?",1644112751.0

788,I don’t know if I have any real friends,"I’m just super confused right  now

So a little info about me to make the situation more understandable. (im gonna try and make this as anonymous as possible)I’m a junior in high school and  I’m involved in after school activities at my school. These activities require me to be there for at least 3 hours after school and sometimes 8 hours for about 2 weeks during the summer. We also have sometimes 12 hour or a few day long trips over the weekends. 

There are a group of kids that i’m around often more times then my own family. At first during my freshman year of high school none of them liked me(which looking back at it is understandable) but now i’ve matured and changed a lot since then. during my sophomore year i started talking to them more and getting to know them. I started becoming really good friends with them. We would hang out alot, go out to eat etc. But over these past few months they have slowly started to distance themselves from me, i’ve asked one of my friends who i believe is a close friend what they think of me, and its always I don’t know or something like that. During these past few months i’ve realized how much they distance themselves from me and this has caused me a bunch of mental issues. I’m not suicidal or depressed but i feel like i’ve come close to it multiple times. I constantly feel like i’m just tolerated, like I kinda have friends but i’m not sure. I feel like no one is really there to help.

Never in my life have I felt like i’ve had any real friends and this whole situation has made it much worse. Everyday I feel like they hate me and don’t want me to talk to them at all and i’ve done so much to try and fix problems or be a good friend but nothing seems to work. It just looks like the despise my presence and hate when I come around. I’m so scared to confront them about it because knowing them they would just laugh in my face or something. Might I add I see them literally every single day and i’m scared to tell them what’s going on because I’m scared they’ll see me differently. I don’t open up to anyone at all because I can’t trust people, I never have. My trust issues are so bad I don’t even like opening up to my own mother. No one bothers to check up on me and I feel so alone, I’ve never had a friend to lean on or talk to when times get rough but i’ve always been that friend to lean on and talk to when times are tough. This situation is causing me to lose passion for the activity and lose motivation in school, and I really don’t want that to happen at all.

They have multiple group chats for the soul purpose of excluding me. They treat me like shit. They don’t engage contact with me. I really don’t wanna let go because I feel like it’s still semi salvageable and I care for them so much, but it just seems like no one cares for me.There’s just nothing I can do about it anymore I feel so lost like a shipwreck at sea.

789,How do I cope with being raped by my close friend?,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I was raped by a close friend in June. It's been really hard to deal with. There was a time that he did care for me and would get upset if I was upset. Then he told me he lost respect me for at the beginning of 2021 because of my depression. He called me pathetic. He yelled at me for crying because I was ""trying to make him feel sorry for me."" He would break stuff and blame it on me for upsetting him. He just changed and become aggressive out of the blue. I really wasn't expecting it. We had been friends for 6 years. Again, he said he lost respect for me at the beginning of 2021 and I think that's why he eventually did what he did. Because he didn't care about me anymore and looked down on me for ""being pathetic"".

My life was already falling part before this happened. I lost another friend in the middle of 2018. I've started to acknowledge that my family is toxic and slowly become estranged from them. I don't have a lot of people in my life. I have 2 acquaintance and one person I would call a close friend. However, my close friend is still going to remain friendly with my rapist since the have a bunch of mutual friends. Since it would be too complicated to cut that person out of their life.

After going through a lot of stuff this has become the icing on the cake. I've pretty much become a shut in. I don't leave the house. I don't have any desire to leave the house. I don't want to make friends or, meet new people. I'd honest be fine with spending the rest of the year at home.

i took driver’s ed sophomore year in hs and i passed the knowledge test this may (6 months ago) with a 90. decent grade. anyways for my 16th birthday i asked if i could go to driving school. my parents said yes.

my mom told me to wait until school started in september so the driving school wouldn’t be so busy (i already had a bad feeling) then around last month i contacted this driving school near me and we emailed back and forth and i told my mom they needed certain documents like my birth certificate and my SSN card. the driving instructor would take these to the DMV and get my permit for me after i was done with the six hours behind the wheel with the school.

my mom didn’t like this very much but it is literally required and the school has a good reputation because it is listed as one of the driving schools the DMV recognizes as you know, driving school. anyways, on friday (three days ago) the driving instructor was supposed to come around 3pm. i got picked up after school and asked my dad if the driving instructor was going to come bc it was more or less 3pm when i got in the car.

he then told me he said no and that he didn’t trust them. when i got angry he told me that if i had attitude, i’d had to wait until i was 18 to drive. my mom was then like “why do you need to drive at 16? where are you gonna go?” (YOU DON’T EVEN LET ME GO ANYWHERE 🤨) and she was fucking switching to my dad’s side even though prior she was encouraging me to go to driving school and seemed fine with it.

i asked my parents multiple times and they said yes and now just before my information was supposed to be submitted so i could get my permit (after 6 hours of driving school) they said fucking no. they led me on for six fucking months. i ignored my parents friday, saturday, as well as today. they tried talking today to me, i got frustrated and told them that they literally did no let me do anything (they don’t).

they then proceeded to laugh at me and brought up shit like “what car are you gonna use? you need to buy a car” you don’t let me get a fucking job??? and they never fucking brought this up before. they’re make every excuse they can so that i won’t go. (i only have enough $ saved for driving school due to birthdays and holidays and shit lol)

i am not a person that cries but i have cried over this five times now in the span of three days. i am so fucking frustrated right now because they knew how excited i was for this and honestly i am just completely devastated. i cannot believe they led me on for nothing. 

now i am giving them the silent treatment and let me tell you, they deserve it because i’m done with them. you want to treat me like a child? go again, i’ll act like one.",1636958784.0

hello reddit! I apologize for the long post, but i feel like i need to tell the story with full context. I feel so angry and sad but I don't think I'm correct in blaming him so much. please help. 

I (22f) was good friends with a boy (22m) in my school. We met because we lived next door to each other, and we had 4/5 of our classes together. We started doing homework together almost every days and established a good friendship.

\-I told him many times, some seriously , some casually, about how i did not want to be anything more than friends, and that i never wanted to do anything physical. He took this fine, said that he would be down to get physical, but was fine without it and ofc wanted to stay friends with me. I really trusted that and that reaction grew my trust in him. Also, he knew that sex meant something to me, as I have only ever done it 3 times with boyfriends. 

\-He asks me to get a drink with him alone about 2 weeks before this incident. I told him I was sick and tired, he pressured it constantly, saying get up, your fine, get up etc. I did not go after explaining to him multiple times that I did not want to. He was mostly joking around but it still felt weird.

\-We are still friends at this point but I feel some discomfort with the thought of going out alone with him. I think I'm overreacting and that he just wanted to go as friends so i ignored it and assumed i was being crazy.

\-Then, about a week later, he asks me to go out for drinks again. he said he was sad the night before because he was alone, and wanted to do something. i told him i was drunk from dinner with a friend and wasn't feeling great. he said “I was all hyped now ur gonna bail??” then i felt bad. i told him I would go as long as we got home early. we ubered there, I wanted to go home after the first place and i told him this many times. he said no no lets try other bars. we go to another one, then another where he buys me a drink even though i said i didn't want another.

we uber home, he asks to come up to mine. I \~being so drunk and blindly trusting him\~ allow him to come up. Now, things are fuzzy since this last drink, i don't remember many of the events because of how drunk I was. I’m not sure how drunk he was, but he was without a doubt less drunk then i was. we drank the same number of drinks and I had drank before and he weighs about 100 pounds more than me

I got in bed to sleep while he was sitting at a chair and talking. he got in my bed, we talked, I couldn't tell u what about. he gets up and offers to leave in a weird way saying that he feels like he's bothering me and like giving me this suggestive look. I say its ok you can stay (I don't know why). We are sitting next to each other, he kisses me and pushes me back on the bed. I have no idea why I do this but I kiss back. I was enthusiastic. I guess he took this as consent for sex because he took off his clothes. I don't think he asked specifically about sex. But I think he asked ""is this fine"" at some point and I said yes. I did take off my clothes I think??? he kinda pushed me down and I remember saying I was nervous and he said “just put me in” 

\-At some point I stopped it and ended it when I realized. I didn't tell him I was uncomfortable because I was so confused.

\-He spent the night, tried to touch me in the morning and I laughed it off. I took a shower and he left, before leaving he asked if I felt taken advantage of. I know a lot of this is my fault. I think it may stem back to a fear that he wouldn't be my friend anymore if I didn't do it.

\-Since then, i've kept more and more of a distance each day as I get angrier and angrier. 

\-he asked to go out for drinks again the next Friday. I said no and he kept saying that he wouldn't help me with my homework or anything anymore if i didn't. I still didn't go, and I think he was mostly joking, but I haven't talked to him much since then. Seeing him makes me feel sick. I don't know what to do or what happened. I know I can’t expect him to read my mind, I didn’t show any signs of discomfort when it happened, I was borderline enthusiastic

807,I feel so alone.,"WARNING: LONG read!

Everywhere  I go, all I see are these beautiful young people who are out living the  lives of their dreams, happy, unafraid and free. Beautiful, young  adults, enjoying their youth. People who have grown into the features  that they used to feel insecure about as teenagers. And thats the thing,  they grew past that. It wasn't only those physical traits they disliked  about themselves, it was the social awkwardness, it was the  intimidation talking to older people gave them. And now, I feel like  it's just me. I'm all alone. I'm the only one that can't do any of that  stuff right.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I see people my age  (22 years old) or around my age who can walk right up to anyone and  start up a very interesting conversation. They make it look so easy. It  seems the words just come to them so effortlessly and they sound so  mature while conducting the entire conversation. They're so graceful and  they have such a sense of humor. I look like a maniac!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's  like being in a store and buying what you need. The people I see can  buy and do everything they need and start up a conversation all at the  same time (gracefully). Me? I look like a maniac! Most of the time, I'd  hurry up to cashier and pile my stuff onto the checkout in a mess. I  just can't think of anything to say to them even if my life depended on  it! I'm just too scared! I'm constantly in a hurry and just want to get  my stuff and go.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Im not like  everyone else and I'm not just saying that to say ""oh I'm not like other  girls!"" LOL! No! Not at all! In fact, I'm different and not in the  ""special"" type of way. It's more of like a curse. Ever since I was in my  pre teens, I was made fun of, discluded, singled out and called the  weird girl. The problem is, It never ended. While everyone else got  their fairytale glow up, I stayed awkward and quite frankly ""ugly"" I  never grew into my features.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had  and still have a variety of issues that I never fully recovered from.  Was bullied in 7th by a girl who spread terrible rumors about me to my  entire grade. When I got into an accident that involved me hitting my  head, I was pulled out of school and never went back (got my diploma and  graduated highschool, but never went to prom and got all glammed up  like I wanted to. It was my dream, but turns out my bully followed me to  the school I transferred to the very next year, never saw her because I  was online schooled for the rest of high school. I told her way too  much before I transferred and that's how she knew and apparently she was  still dead set on making my life a living hell even after I almost  died. So I guess not going wasn't tok bad of an idea) . I basically ran  away from life because I felt worthless.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The  thing that makes all of this much worse for me I that my parents and  everyone around me is embarrassed to be seen around me. My dad in  particular. Whenever we go to the store he tries to talk to me as little  as possible. With my other sisters, he talks to them all of the time  and actually laughs with them. With me, he doesn't. I even remember my  sisters talking really negatively about me before my oldest sister moved  away behind my back. They'd say I was ""so ret\*rded"" that I was  ""embarrassing to be around in public"" that I was ""ugly"". Things like  that.

I actually do get stared at a  lot in public and made fun of. Strangers do this. I have a nose like my  fathers and it's pretty big! I don't have a pretty voice either. It  actually does sound retarded, but I can't fix that at all! My mom gets  complimented and hit on and she 52 ! Its never me! When its not my mom,  it's my oldest sister. When strangers see me, they always look away and I  can see them smiling as if they are trying not to laugh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My  mom is always the one people talk to, if my moms not there and it's  someone else, they'll talk to that person. I get avoided and eventually  talked bad about with the same things.  ""She's weird"" a freak, a loser,  ugly ect...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just want to grow up  too! I want to turn into a beautiful swan and be a young, elegant,  graceful, youthful woman with class who is worthy of her parents love  and being proud of. But no.... my dad is ashamed of me. My mom ignores  me because the conversation becomes awkward. I just can't socialize o do  anything right!!!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The only thing I  have to like about myself is my intelligence. In high school, I got on  honor roll. I was the only one of my sisters. I could write really smart  sounding papers when I give it my all. Right now, I'm depressed and  really don't feel like it. I just want to be normal like everyone else.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I  don't know, what are your guys' thoughts? Can anyone relate? Even if  your case is not as bad as mine? I still feel you. I personally hate  when people try to say well, this person has it much worse than you!  That never makes someone else' situation less valid! My mom actually does that  to me all the time, but I just let it go. After all, I can't change her.   I'm in need of support. Please help.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

{And... There's one more thing I forgot to add. People just don't like me and It doesn't matter how old or young they are, they'll make fun of me regardless. I'm not rude or purposefully mean in any way. I try to be the best human being I can be. I see everyone around me having friends, being in love and just having someone to talk to, but when it comes to me no one wants to be associated with me. Even relatives or family members that I used to know as a child and that swore they would have always loved me, started to dislike me too. It's like the bond we had was never even there to begin with.

I can't form ""real"" meaningful relationships and most of the time, the moment I even begin to think they're real, those people I thought had my back begin saying that I'm all those things mentioned above and that nobody actually likes me. Everyone is just so likeable, sociable and pretty and I'm the opposite.}

With the exception of a few small mishaps, its been a good 3 months at the job.

811,"Living in the past, dying in the present","I just graduated from college a few weeks ago.

And with that, a lot of suppressed thoughts and painful emotions have come up to the surface. I have been obsessing about my past/mistakes every single day now and I seem to can't stop. For as long as I can remember, I was the kind of kid who was quite anxious to grow up. I (REALLY) hated change and still do. I thought that would shake off of me by now, but the way life becomes more and more real as you get older- of course, this would punch me in the face at some point. You can't run away from it. And if you try to, it will only eat you alive. I realize that with every year, in the back of my mind I would tell myself to ""enjoy it while it lasts."" the freedom. the lack of responsibility. youth. nights where you are with your friends being stupid. flirting with guys and having flings that didn't amount to anything serious. I knew that one day, I'll be a full-grown adult at some party dressed head-to-toe in some flashy gown with my parents smiling from afar, proud that their daughter looks the best, ready to be taken by some guy and shipped off with a ring on my finger.  That I would be the happy girl, the pretty girl, the successful girl with straight As who would pick a 9-5 job, but also be able to find the one and have kids at a young age. I wasn't looking forward to any of it for a long time, and I am not sure if that is just because I am a scaredy-cat, or because I don't want it at all. I have a lot of deep issues that I realize I had from a young age but manifested themselves into something bigger in my 20s. I became the worst version of myself. I was the sad girl, the anxious girl, the addictive personality girl, the binge-eating girl, the one who became a shell of themselves at home stuck in a cycle of deterioration... kind of girl.

Now I have been a person who has been constantly living in the past for a few years now, but the past few weeks have been worse than ever. I am suddenly obsessing over ALL my mistakes at once, to the point that I can't do anything. I have shut off my phone, ignoring all my friends, just smoking, and eating food. Ignoring the fact that I need to take my life more seriously and make some real decisions.

I am pressing pause on my life, but it keeps going anyways, without me. I am in deep misery over the past 4 years I have wasted, all because I hated myself. All because I was scared of having new experiences. I kept telling myself I couldn't go to that college class, I couldn't go to that party and talk to that guy, I can't go on that trip with my friends, not until I felt better. Not until I looked a certain way. Not until I lost all the weight from my binge-eating disorder. Not until I stopped smoking this joint (I have had a long, terrible relationship with weed). I became the absolute worst version of myself. I was a girl who was happy, a good daughter, friend, just going with the motions, living life every year at school, having fun, going out to movies, on trips. Not worrying over grades, boys, and my future. Depressed, moody, angry, anxious, needy, etc. And then, when I graduated college I realized that it was over. I was no longer some young kid that could deeply romanticize life and complain and be *reckless*\- now I was an adult doing it. And it just doesn't feel good. 

I can feel like there is almost some pull on me, keeping me in this twisted dangerous life-sucking mindset. I am not an idiot, I know how it sounds. I know there is no point in focusing on my past mistakes since it's over. I know I should take this experience and just start living NOW. But I can't help it. I feel deep shame and sadness that I didn't realize my sickness was blinding me. I wish I snapped out of it. *Why do I feel like life is over and that I can't have fun anymore?* Why do I feel this way and why am I like this meanwhile everyone else in my life seems to be able to accept growing up? I loved being young and I am sad that now I have all these things I need to do. When I don't want to do anything at all. I feel paralyzed. 

I guess I am writing this to release some of the pain. I wish there was someone out there who can tell me they have gone through something similar. I wish there was a piece of advice that can actually get to me and help me for the first time. I wish there was a book that talks about this and can teach me ways to stop wasting my life. I wish there was a way to stop my instinctive thoughts.

I wish...

814,Too many stressors,"I just found out today that my grandfather has dementia in the early stages. He doesn’t know right now, but in a few weeks my grandmother is bringing him to an Alzheimer’s clinic to get a broad test. I only know because after my grandmother called the cops on my sister, she was really upset and wanted to explain why. She called the cops because my sister was threatening suicide if she didn’t get her phone back. This is not an exaggeration, she really did threaten to do it suicide if my mom, who was in Wisconsin which is a few states away, didn’t completely unlock her iPhone and disable restrictions. Today, right after I found out, my sister threw a fit and said she had been locked in the car (which isn’t possible because of fire hazards and motor vehicle laws) and started attacking my mom. She hit her four times while I was waiting outside the car and when we started driving, she stabbed her with a large safety pin and claimed it was an accidental stab when she was “just trying to hit” my mom. She’s 13, but she’s 5’7 and weighs 175 pounds and is seriously threatening to those around her. She has ODD, and she blows up at anyone who tries to criticize her or tell her to stop doing anything, no matter how small. She is a menace to everyone around her, and it’s been escalating. The stab in the car made my mom bleed. I’m not sure what to do, and my neurological, physical, and mental illnesses make it hard for me to try to do anything. My autism prevents me from getting close to anything loud with severe anxiety and nausea, my sympathetic nervous system, the one that controls the bodily response to stress, is hyperactive to the point that it’s now a medical issue and causes severe tremors even when I’m not stressed and a high heart rate and high blood pressure, and I have a severe form of EDS and my joints dislocate and my organs slide at the smallest misstep. Not including those, I have 19 other severe diagnoses and I have been passing out, vomiting, getting cluster headaches that wake me up, migraines, and my mental health has taken a dive because of her. I have no idea how to deal with this. Some people have said that it’s just a kid and this is normal, but I don’t know anyone who’s sister makes their mother bleed on purpose. My dog is my main source of comfort, and she has stress induced seizures, mainly caused by my sister’s tantrums, which then gives me more stress. Other people have said that because of the trauma she went through (our father, who I now have a restraining order against, was abusive, but I took the brunt of it because she’s my little sister and he liked her more (aka he just hated me passionately). I can’t have any semblance of a conversation with her because it would put me in bodily danger, but I also can’t continue like this. My house is a toxic and dangerous place simply because of my sister. She cusses, gaslights, steals, hits, throws stuff, screams, and manipulates everyone around her and no one knows how to deal with it either. She is all forms of abusive and is making me worried I’ll have another psychotic break (I have a genetic weakness to psychosis and my pernicious anemia) and I’m struggling to keep calm around her. She’s like this at least twice a week. How can I begin to deal with this?",1622083523.0
815,Etiquette for catching up with old friends after a hiatus filled with devastation - Help & Advice needed.,"I hope this is the correct sub to post this. 

Long story short, the past 4 years have been a nightmare. I'm in my late 30s - just got a slight handle of dealing with fallouts of a very abusive and toxic childhood (and young adulthood)..and everything was going okay... when the people closest to me started dying. Will try to be brief:

* Best friend got murdered at his job - my life was thrown into disarray, without even having time to grieve or process - criminal proceedings take years and do nothing to help no matter what the outcome. This was a person I considered parent-like. 
* Another best friend got shot in the heart during a robbery. This sucked so much. I didn't even find out till months later, because I live in a different country. We went to Uni together... now they are gone, leaving behind a wife and 2 kids.
* Another friend (from Uni days) who happened to live in the same block as me, ""fell"" out their window. I saw it happen as I lived below them. Apparently, they succumbed to the throes of untreatable depression. (yay lack of mental health care)
* Another best friend, whom also was very parent-like to me, also succumbed to depression. This one I saw happening and I couldn't do anything. The person did everything they could to try and save themselves, but being put through the wringer that is ""mental health care"" where I live resulted in them deciding to go with dignity and on their own terms. 

It's been barely 4 years where all this happened one after another. My brain feels absolutely squashed and somehow I'm barely getting by. Covid was great, because it finally let me isolate my self at home where I could slowly start to sort out the shitstorm that happened. My house is filled with dead people's things (that I treasure and use, but it's really hard at the same time to look at things that are supposed to be in my friends' houses.)

&#x200B;

Recently, I've tried poking my head out. I commented on an old friend's fb post, and they started wanting to catch up. This person is really cool, and older and wiser...but we haven't really had a chat for more than 5 years (different state).

How the hell do you ""catch-up"" with a friend when that's what's been going on in your life? It seemed cruel to even start describing what happened, but then it's like I keep getting told you need to share things with your friends, otherwise they won't know....

But how?

Is there some kind of etiquette to deliver this kind of news? I felt really bad - I had to eat a bunch of mushrooms and chainsmoke just so I could muster the strength to do the video-call with this friend. 

It's weird because even my job (which is something that I've worked hard for and very passionate about) is very closely tied to my relationships with the now-dead people. Like even something seemingly innocuous (e.g. How's your band?) is a really fucked up thing for me to get into. 

(oh my band is fine. half of it got killed, so here i am stuck with a collection of my best friend's instruments, and hard drives full of various projects in various stages - I cannot bring myself to listen to these yet because my friend's voice is going to break me. I also inherited a cat that watched a murder happen, so that makes 2 life-forms with PTSD in my apartment. I don't want to play any of those songs yet, because I also don't want to freak out the cat. My friend had the cat for 15 years, since he was a kitten.)

Anyway, as you can all see - it gets rambly because I don't know how to summarize stuff like this. I live in a large country where people move a lot and it's normal to not properly 'catch-up' for years. But this is ridiculous. I feel like an ass, because usually my friends and I would casually msg or comment as a way to stay in touch. But I've also been the one that's in hiding all these years....didn't know what else to do.

And then I'm wary that there will be ""well-wishers"" and lots of unsolicted advice from people whose worst experience the past year was maybe a flat tire and not being able to go out with their friends due to covid.

Don't know how to deal. Please help. Thank you to all who made it this far with my ramble.",1621281267.0

Help??","We had a cat pass away two weeks ago, we had him since he was a kitten, he was a mane coon (I think how it's spelled) type orange tabby we named Canelo after the boxer, we got him 6 years ago and he was still young, at first we thought be had a bladderstone as he couldn't pee, then he couldn't poop, and we couldn't have a vets appointment until it was two late.

Friday morning at 5 am, I woke up to the sobbing from my brother and mother, the night before he wouldn't stop meowing at all of us, and like an idiot asshole, I didn't pay much attention because he was starting to get a bit better, jumping and all that, and it was usual for him to meow frequently, so I just ignored him, I was reading Beastars with my boyfriend because he wanted to listen to it and he knew I kinda liked it for the plot. When I had awakened, I knew what had happened, they were right to the left of my bed, he had chosen to died in the midway of all of our bedrooms, he must have wanted to be near us. My brother told me 20 minutes before I woke he took his last breath in my mother's arms, it took me thirty minutes to start crying, I didn't even get to say goodbye.

I want to say I'm over it but I hear him and see him everywhere, mind you, we have another cat who's been taking it okay, but was heartbroken until a few days after, but he hasn't been where I see Canelo, I keep seeing him in my dreams, I keep hearing the silly way he used to pur by your head while you slept, but there was no cat around. We found out that Canelo had a massive internal tumor, he was suffering from cancer and didn't show any signs until it was too late.

There's a cat for adoption at the local shelter, his name is Elmo and he is a brown/gray tabby, he's a kitten about 8 months or so, and his life story makes me so sad for him, but my mom tells me not to get him as it may be too soon for me, and that maybe we'll be moving soon, but I just don't know what to do, I'm afraid I'm angering people with how often I call them at like midnight or three am crying about him, but there's so much I miss about him and I don't know how to get over it.

I just wish the day he died I could've had the day off, I work at a local McDonald's and they were overstaffed that day, but because it was one of my last days there, they wouldn't even give me an hour to stop crying so I had to force myself to stop, so I quit the same day after my shift, I know it was a shitty thing, but they couldn't bother to help me?

I'm sorry this went on and was all over the place, I just don't know what to do and am still overly emotional about it, it feels like it's a dream and I'll wake up and he's in his usual spot and meowing softly at me, but I also know it'll never happen, does anyone know any good ways to help?

Im 20 and dropped out of colledge during 2nd semester (theyre 'free' but mostly complete bullshit in my country) because I couldnt go on on this course of studies (it was mostly deprecated and extremely low quality + tons of unnecessary stress). 

&#x200B;

When corona came I was trapped in my 100 squarefeet single apartment and completely isolatet with alcoholic neighbours. that was the  starting shot to pause it. -> lets not argue that, Im pretty sure that Im going to finish it when corona-lockdown is done (or next year, whatever happens earlier). 

During colledge the relationship to them improved and went to nearly peace. so i thought it would be fine. Well. now its winter, everyone is working in homeoffice and hates or each other except my 2nd brother. I think i found out that their toxicness is related to winter.

I tried to fix it now but my dad gets offended easily because he takes everything personally. My elder brother doesnt but he is the type of guy that is willing to snitch for some extra 'control' others.

&#x200B;

instantly after my return in the month corona started, I started working on a project, that could be my way out of this situation and get me into a specific university i couldnt afford.

Deadline is end of january. im around 90% finished, but i ceartainly wont get the last 10% with that emotional baggage from my dad. I tried fixing it for the last 3 years. it didnt work. I even asked the people in my former circle. Didnt work. so i tried minimalizing damage via grey-stone strategy.

&#x200B;

However Now I got 2 stressfactors, a rational (no problem I'm good at that) and an irrational ('family').

I asked the people I know in this location, but I never was able o build solid friendships because I didnt know how to keep them up and I have trust issues.

I live in a more rural area, so no libarys and so on here. and its freaking cold, so i only can escape for an hour outside until i get sick. 

**BUT I need to focus and work on the project. I dont have any savings left and cant spent my time on working next to this project.**

Is there anything I can do? (without friends, family, money). and without giving up?

for those that know MBTI: 

I would type them like this:

dad, brother1 : ISTJ (high probability to be ""vulnerable narcissists"", always playing the victim)

younger brother: INTP

me: INFJ/ENTP (I was forced into rationalizing and escaping from that ""ideal"" picture of being able to have a harmonic family. It really changed me, but i dont think its healthy)

All I need:  a calm space with warmth and energy+wifi so I can finish the project.",1607678833.0
829,TW: Does it really get better?," Hey Reddit,
  
 Im a 15 year old trans male. I am currently living in a house that doesn’t accept me. Over the past two months i have been repeatedly sexually assaulted almost everyday by a guy in my school. I fell into a rlly deep hole of addiction to many substances and am considering where i go from here.

My friend whom i thought was a nice person has been making fun of my substance problems and sexual assault behind my back. 

 My grades are slipping and my family is starting to hate me now. Its clear I’ll never make it in photo/filmography. 

 Everyday feels the same, im living for my girlfriend. Shes the light of my life but i know im never going to be enough of a boy for her, no matter what she says. Im just afraid that if i leave shell go too. And she deserves better than that

 Im so down. Everyone tells me “it gets better” when its only ever gotten worse...... How do find purpose in a life where everything keeps going wrong?",1606957233.0

Ive lost it, i need advice from people with more life experiences. Sorry for whatever this post is. But im losing it all",1606196986.0
831,I'm not sure where this belongs but its more about my feelings towards the neglector than the animals so I'm guessing here. I'm having a hard time not giving her a piece of my mind,"I rescued a chinchilla from a bad owner. Her mother got the chinchilla as a I'm dying yolo thing. She had her for 2 years before her passing. Once she died her daughter got it and kept her for a year. She said that the chinchilla was in way worse shape when she got her but idk about that or how that's even possible. 

This was her condition day 1 with me:

She was In a one story cage barely suitable for rats

Super thin, I could feel every rib and bone without trying

Mats everywhere! I had to do a lot of grooming. It took me 4 days to get them all. I did 3 ""shifts"" a day that were 2 hours long so 6hs x 4 days took me 24hs to get them all in one little critter. She was so good and thankful when every mat came undone. The biggest one was about 2 inches in diameter. 

Her teeth and nails were extra long and needed trimming

She said she got dust baths regularly but I saw very little evidence confirming this

She had no toys, no salt tabs, only a wheel that she never used because it was to small. 

I don't know what kind of food she was getting but it was definitely not good for her. She gave it to me in a coffee can but the pellets where pretty pale in color and some were really long so I'm assuming it was the cheapest food she could find. 

She had no hay only pellets

They kept the bark AND MOSS on the branches they gave her. 

She's also small and underdeveloped like she's frozen in chinchilla teenager years.

Laslty, she was alone and suffering from depression 😔 

Vet gave her a cleared her of any issues and says she just needs more and better care. 

My issue:

I'm so mad at her previous owners for letting her get to that extent. Every day I look at her I feel grateful that she's with me and happy now but then I go to bitching out her previous owners in my head. I can't stop it I just want to get in her face and give her one hell of a spit spraying speech. People like that should be punished for what they've done to an innocent animal. 

The help I need:
How do I stop bitching her out in my head? Should I take my anger out on her through text? (I know this is rarely the answer) I have her number still and never said anything bad to her yet. Just thank you for the chinchilla and an update saying she's much happier and doing better. I have to stop myself from giving her a hard time. At the end of the day she did the right the thing by rehoming her. My conflict is that her mom should of never got a chinchilla and the daughter should if got the chinchilla help a lot sooner.",1603567581.0

837,The ganging up didn’t hurt as much as the betrayal,"If you have the time I need advice. I’ve been having anxiety shakes for about a year now that makes my body feel numb and even when I repeat the situation over and over again I have no clue on why I’m hurting so bad or why I feel so vengeful was wondering if I could get some advice?                                                                   When I was Highschool I got into physical fight with two girls that where verbally bullying literally every day for a year and a half I  told 6 adult trying to fix thins but no one help so I just took the abuse.the one who was suppose to fight me had her friend do it so I had no clue then she jumped in I fought back pretty well even tho it was two against one one girl was crying and the other stopped helping her friend after I hit her in the face (I’m told I’m heavy handed) I had no exaggeration 8 teacher holding me back while she had her friend who was helping her fight then stopped. My childhood friend watched me get snuck and ganged up on but never help and that broke my heart plus none of the people who say they where my friends help either that hurt me so bad. The fight was 10 seconds so pretty quick. 

When I got back from suspension some a lot of people felt bad for me since they new what was going on I cried in my bed for a couple of days because even tho I stood my ground the people I was fighting were popular plus the most popular guy in school was friends with them so they swayed the freshman and sophomore opinion of me  but the junior and seniors tried to be friends with because of it. 

I had to remediate with the girl but the girl who fought me would not look me in the eyes and the girl who jumped in was doing all the talking when I asked why the girl hit me her friend spoke for her and said she hit you because you were talking about me. The principal and the girls both told me to get over it and to move past it which angered me even more plus the principal told the girls who denied it that they did jump me and since it was a two on one I lost but the few people who where there said I did good and their jump was so bad it should be considered a tie.

my childhood friend mother mad an excuse for her daughter saying that it was not really jumping because the second girl didn’t hit me the whole duration of the fight and my child hood friend lied and said she was being held back then admitted that she just wanted to see how I would fight so she didn’t help. 

Anyway I hate the way I feel now it’s like I hate everyone and I feel betrayed by everyone it’s to the point where I created a fake persona that allows me to get close but not to close with people and I keep having these anxiety shakes that make my body feel numb I don’t now why I feel this way what do you think?

I did post this on the mental health Reddit and haven’t gotten any responses, so I figured I’d add it here. 

I made this as a throw away for personal reasons and I’ll add a few tldrs. On my phone so sorry for formatting

I had a friend and we dated a bit a few months ago but broke it off, very... roughly? It was not an easy break up. But recently we chatted a small bit and it seemed she (I’m a guy) missed our relationship despite already being in one and saying over and over again that I’m a “trap” though messages me bi-daily. The other day I asked her if it hurt her for us to talk as friends as I’ve gotten over us, and as I said, she talked a lot about our old relationship like she missed it. At which point she said she didn’t know and asked if I’ve gotten over her. I said “Yeah, I reminisce every now and then but nothing serious or worth acting on” at which point she said “That’s all I needed to hear” after that she became really cold saying that she was “emotionally detaching herself.” I offered that rather than folding away those emotions that she should face them, she brushed me off saying “I’ll be fine.” And I’m thinking this is exactly the problem. During the breakup she closed off and hid her emotions only for them to re-emerge when we became friends and hurt her more. I try to get her to see that but she still brushes me off and self pity’s herself saying things like “I've already accepted the fact that no one will truly like me and want to date me, so I’m set for life” despite being in a relationship during the conversation. After that I tell her to stop self pitying and that there’s 8 billion people, it’s nearly impossible for her not to find the right one. She jokes about commuting suicide, which isn’t new behavior as she’s done it before, and then makes remarks about her parents “moving the gun.” 
This was last night, she didn’t commit suicide, she viewed my insta story this morning but She’s so unstable and I want to steady her but I don’t know how to do that without hurting her or that she even wants help. 

TLDR: My unstable ex gf that’s now my friend misses our old relationship despite being in one already. I confront her about it and she closes off and threatens suicide (she’s threatened it before and is fine as of this morning). I want to help her but don’t want to hurt her nor do I  know how to help. 



Issue #2: 

Also if you’re still reading, I truly thank you, I know this is a lot. 

My friends accuse me of being narcissistic and egotistical. Nearly daily. I often make jokes about myself saying I’m the “sexiest man alive” or haven’t “largest ass ‘round town” fully knowing I’m actually a low 3 with a tiny ass. And it usually gets a number of laughs. I always carry myself strongly and don’t take insults, like actual insults and not jokes, well, usually placing a well aimed insult back on the other person. As well as when I play games I’ll fight hard until I die, not the type to give up. As well I’ve slapped people for touching my hair, which is the love and pride of my body. I don’t think I’m either. I understand where they may be coming from but the difference is I don’t believe I’m above other people, I’m fully aware I’m below a lot of people as well as I empathize with those below me and as you’ve seen above that I care for people. What do you guys think? Am I narcissistic and egotistical? Willing to answer questions, just take it easy on me though because I’m also known to be oblivious at times. 

TLDR: My friends think I’m narcissistic and egotistical due to my jokes about being an attractive person despite me knowing full well I’m not, and unwilling-ness to lose. Though I don’t see myself that way as I’m empathetic and understand I’m below a lot of people, what do you think?

I don’t have any friends and I can’t go out to make some, I don’t know my teachers so school is very hard and worst of all they always say that I’m spoilt and should have some empathy for them.

If you’ve read this far, thank you but now we reach the actual problem. My parents two nights in a row have ranted to me about how bad I’ve been lately. On the first night they started of with little stuff like saying “you’ll never make it to university, your not smart enough” “you don’t have a good enough work ethic to make the military”. Those were fine but on the second night my shouted at me “at this rate we will make you pay rent” and my mum said “hurry up and fucking move out” with them calling me an asshole in between.

I don’t know how to cope with these situations, by the end of them I was so angry I wanted to just stand up punch someone and leave the house. Anywhere I read says to walk out of the room and calm down but my dad thinks disrespectful and last time I did that he lifted me by the neck.

857,I just need to put this somewhere where I'll actually get a good response,Look I really need some help. I'm in a relationship about to be 7 months in. She's not the problem. It's me. I have a big ass problem where I get used to the presence of my partner. And when she's not around I get sad and think about how happy I would be if she was. But then that makes it worse because I feel like if I did something more she could be here next to me again to tell me imma make it and comfort me. Someone please wtf am I suffering. It's harder to love myself like this. I don't feel like it's her fault because she hasn't done anything more than love me and been there when I needed her just like I have for her but I don't understand why me missing her is enough to drive me to tears more often than not like how I am right now. I really just want to wrap my Honda around a freaking tree rn. Do I hate myself too much to love wtf is it someone please I need an answer I need peace again with myself I can't lose her and I feel like I will if I cant find peace with myself and get through this.

858,My mother told me she has depression,"About a month or two ago, my parents told me and my sister to come downstairs and had a talk with us. My sister is 11 and I’m 13. Our parents basically told us that we were doing a pretty shitty job at being children and that we weren’t really doing anything around the house (not with those words of course). I was aware that my mother wasn’t well, both physically and mentally, for some time but I never thought that she had depression. (She also has Borderline because of her childhood but that’s beside the point) 
My father told us that we were partially responsible for my mother’s depression. (I don’t know about my sister but I cried a whole lot after that talk) That was a really shocking statement for me and I’ve been feeling really, really awful since then. I’ve been trying to better myself and I think I’ve been doing a mediocre job or something like that... 

I recently realised that I’ve been blocking that “experience” out in order to kind of cope with it (which doesn’t get me anywhere, tbh). 

I’ve been feeling numb since that happened and my memories have been feeling like they’re not mine but rather someone else’s. It feels like I’m watching a movie when I’m remembering stuff. I sometimes have moments or entire hours where I feel like I’m watching myself doing stuff. 

Any advice for me? I’m more or less used to taking criticism but please still try to be a little bit nice about (or not, it’s nothing bad if you’re not nice about it, someone needs to wake me up at some point)",1583784766.0
859,I dont know where else to go.,"I (23m) have been in an ill state for the last 3 years. I have had people in my head talking to me. They act lie psychopaths and even rape me at times (fumbling with their private parts and anal penetration). Sometimes they also force me to be one, leaving me with no emotions. I even feel their pain and they involve me into conversations that I dont want to participate about rape and murder even snuff. Even friends have been in my head and since then I have lost all my respect to them. Even though they can be nice i find it so disrespectful towards me and humans in general. They do what they want and dont listen to a single word that I say. They have even been doing it to my family and worst of all, my dog. I have been to a psychologist and they diagnosed me with scizophrenia. Problems that I have with this is that I only fit into one definition (illusions, if it even is illusions, otherwise its real or delusional) of scizophrenia which shouldnt particularly clasify me as one. I just seriously think the people are in my head trying to mess with me and I believe that there are technologies around to do all of this. I dont remember the name now but Ive heard it mentioned. Saddest thing is that I've been through a worse phase in life before this. I was extremely social phobic and could not leave my house. The only way I liked to move around the city was my bike. It was my only source of getting out. This and I had a few friends around at the time including one that lived nearby. I really liked all of them but I went to a festival a year before and people were horrible to me, calling me a psychopath (i had social phobia and couldnt talk to anyone, i was alone) and I ended up in a trauma. I even had a guy spit at me out of knowhere. This was at the start of the festival but at the end I had a person come into my head like described above and they asked me to merry her. This gave me emense anxiety issues and all I could do was run away and ask for help. Returning to the time before when I had my friends around I felt nothing but anxious. It was like they were responsible for all of that. It was particularly bad around the one person that asked me to merry me in my head. She used to be a great friend before but we were slowly distancing ourselves. At some point she was around me and I felt like she wanted something in a way. This was a bit of a shock for me and from then on out I had no idea what was going on. I just ignored it for now. But then she invited me over some day for a cup of tea. She just asked for sex and i was overun with anxiety. That was probably the moment awkard moment in my life. I even blacked-out and couldnt remember much. I even thought that there was never even a question at all. Now I'm not good at talking so I said good bye. When I got home I was bawling crying. I feld bad that i couldnt say anything so i wrote her a long messaged about why it has all been so strange for me but she never really wrote me anything  relevant back. I even send another message saying that she could do whatever she wants but she didnt reply at all this time I was really scared to lose her as a friend. Problem is these kinds of senarious happened so many times that I started to hate her and i even considered her a psychopath (she wasnt) at some stage. This I never said as I wanted to keep my friendship with her. She was an important part of my life a few years back. I thought I would just act normal again and enjoy myself. But then she did it again and again and again like leading me on. It made me feel horrible. I didnt even want anthying and I tell her multiples times about this. Even my other friends got involved in this and that made it all worse. One day I lost that bike I  and I almost threw myself off the 4th floor. That really was the final straw for me. I WANTED TO FINISH COLLEGE AND LEAVE. I will go to a psychologist to deal with my issues and find a girlfriend far were they were. I was finishing my reseat exams and failed because i could but attend since my anxiety seems to have developed into a more sever schizoid disorder(when you stop caring about social connections and how they treat you). After college I was waiting for the autumn resits to finish. Just before my last exam a voice appeared in my head. Two days later i attempted suicide but I could not open the window. After that the thing with people being in my head go a lot worse... They made me masturbate to other people one that I thought was the one I wrote about early. I was okay with that at the time but i never really agreed with any of that because they should not be in my head. They even made me fall in love with her and I called her to say that which is really difficult for me. She never even really replied. This was also the night that I was spiked with acid i think or something similar. The night I followed a cat thinking that she would be there. It was my brother that told me all this. I felt so embarrassed . What am I even doing anymore... i regreted aĺl of that so hard. I had even made her a digital picture with us as birds. I still have it as a memory but im stiĺl considering to burn it. I dunno. Nowadays I am just getting raped in my head and even though it is a very bad, i cant describe that state of depression in which I was when I had my bike stolen. Countless hours of a num, meaningless life that was not worth living. I still wish that i had done it so that this isnt happening anymore. Only harassment in my brain. I know this is reaĺly long and might be disturbing to listen to and I would be forwever greatful if you have read this far. I have a psychology meeting in a few days and I wiĺl show her this and ask for some meds to help calming down. Again I think people are actually doing this to me deliberately. Does anybody know if something like this exists? I'm actually in a good mood atm but I just have no social motivation. I still have anxiety which makes it really difficult to find friends that dont have ties to my old friends and I cant make any. I have tried tinder since I have not had a girlfriend in 7 years and it is getting reaĺly lonely in rural Ireland. I have written to a few but they never end up replying maybe because I am not the most attractive man. I am very skinny. I also have extreme difficulties approaching women. On top of all of that I have a sexual disfuntion related to the anxiety. My family is around but dont seem to want to help me and tbh i almost find it good because I can atleast feel like a normal person around them even though we dont get on socially at all. I dont even want friends around me. I will hopefull be planning to travel in a few months time with my dog so hopefully life will get better eventually. On the other hand i just want to shoot myself in the head to have it all over with... life is not worth living sometime. Does anybody have any advice? Im considering moving to a city to have more options in women. Is that a good idea? Ive been keeping myself active and things and eat enough. I dunno. Is there anywhere else I can post this? I could really use some support. I only really speak to people 1ce a week or so. Even if someone here can get in contact with me that would be great! Thank you so much for reading! <3",1583198411.0
860,Online disagreement,"So, about two years ago, a former coworker of mine said incredibly vile and racist things about black people and Mexican people and insulted my hobby of language learning. They never faced any repercussions at work and recently they were re-hired at my old job. I decided to get it off my chest and tell them what I thought about them. The first time, I made a fake Facebook and told them what I think. But then I realized that they probably didn’t get it. So then I decided to use my own Facebook two months later. They got it this time, but on further reflection, I feel bad because I think I went too low and I was a bit too mean. I want to apologize, but I’m afraid if I send a third message I could get in trouble for harassment. Bear in mind, neither time did I make any threats or anything, but I want to be sure I won’t get in trouble, for apologizing of all things. For reference, this is in America, I don’t want to disclose the state unless I have to. I feel conflicted, I didn’t even tell the person that they personally insulted my languages which was a huge point because I got too caught up in attacking their character. Bear in mind, they aren’t a very good person, but I shouldn’t have gone down to their level. Anyone have any advice? Thank you.",1581780778.0

My dad never has and will never care. He doesn't like to talk about it, and always says ""there all the same!"" My mom absolutely hates this, she says ""no hes not, nobody's like him"" and they go back and forth until my dad cant handle it anymore. This is where it gets the most frustrating.

""Then you must like him."" 

""No I dont, hes just the same as all the other ones.""

My boyfriend of 5 years was an abusive alcoholic and was arrested in January for domestic violence. On the night he was arrested he barged into my apartment threw me to the floor, destroyed my living room and kicked in my truck doors. Someone herd the altercation and called the police(something I am ashamed to say i wouldn’t have done as I was convinced it was done out of love). They caught him trying to leave the state. A no contact order was put in place and he violated it several times. Going out of his way to harass me on social media and vandalize my truck a second time. I never reported it.. and most likely never will. 

A few months after the incident in January my best friend and I took a trip to Mexico. On this trip I was drugged and raped  by the man who hosted us. When I woke the morning after I was terrified, and I ran to her for help. To my horror and disgust my best friend of 12 years not only didn’t believe me, but asked me several times to apologize to my rapist for being a rude guest. She has since completely cut off any form of communication with me, in total it’s been about 6 months since she spoke to me. I have tried to make contact with her several times but stopped after it was clear she wanted nothing to do with me. She has seemingly moved on with her life as though I never mattered at all.
