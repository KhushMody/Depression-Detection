1,I did it. I was genuinely happy today for a full 24 hours after close to 3 years of crippling suicidal depression.,"I look forward to tomorrow. I look back on the past fondly. I feel like I'm actually, how to say it, quite a worthwhile person.

The feeling has been building up for months now after so much grueling work, which felt like trying to fill up an empty ocean by spitting into it. At first I felt less sad during my nonsuicidal moments. Then I stopped feeling suicidal. Then I started feeling normal for an hour once and a while. Then I felt happy for another hour. Then for 6 hours I could not even remember what depression felt like, and so on.

I'm still here on r/depression and r/SuicideWatch because I know it can come back at any time, and I want to support others who are in my situation. In my heart I feel I have accepted that depression has and probably always will strike me down again. But each time I fall down into the pit, I climb out higher.

I am finally actually and truly thankful I did not kill myself.",1535190931.0
2,Rumination 101,"Hey friends. The following is a really long mind-dump of everything I know about rumination (adapted from [my blog](http://screwdepression.com/rumination-101/)).

One of the major characteristics of depression you will find in the background of every waking moment of your day: mental chatter.

For the average person, mental chatter is probably about themselves, what other people think of them, and what to eat or watch on Netflix. For depressed people, this mental chatter takes a darker tone. Your thoughts are almost constantly negative, self-critical, and highly repetitive.

This type of thinking is called rumination. The term “ruminate” comes from the process where cows digest their food by regurgitating it and chewing it up, over and over. Like cows, when we ruminate we regurgitate mental content and turn it over and over in our minds.

On a moment-to-moment basis, mental chatter (or “self-talk”) is important because it is your background to every waking moment of the day.

On a more big-picture level, these many inconsequential thoughts are important because they back up the personal narratives we make for ourselves. What is rumination in this moment can go on to become ingrained in our stories of ourselves, and influence how we act in the future (aka “self-fulfilling prophecy”, fueling further depression).

### What makes rumination different from regular thoughts?

* Rumination is self-centered.
* Rumination is repetitive.
* Rumination is passive, focusing on current problems and causes, but ignoring solutions or taking action.
* Rumination occurs in the absence of environmental demands that require the thoughts.

Finally, rumination is usually based in [cognitive distortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion). Cognitive distortions are irrational thought patterns that fuel depression and anxiety.

**Some cognitive distortions are:**

* all-or-nothing (or black-and-white) thinking
* overgeneralization
* discounting the positives
* jumping to conclusions (mindreading or * fortunetelling, which leads to self-fulfilling prophecy)
* magnification or minimization
* emotional reasoning
* “should” thinking
* labeling
* personalization and blaming

I find cognitive distortions are also closely related to [pessimistic explanatory styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explanatory_style) and [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias).

###Why does rumination happen?

**Evolutionary psychologists believe that rumination may be a problem-solving adaptation.** If you were confronted with a serious problem in your evolutionary past, it would have been to your benefit to cease other action (like eating, socialization, sex) and bear down on the problem until you had solved it.
There is a lot of research associating rumination and depressive traits with higher creativity, problem-solving, and intelligence.

(While those traits are nice, if you’re reading this article you’d probably rather do without the depression part.)

**Rumination is addictive.** Ruminating feels addictive because it seems like you are right about to find some giant insight into your problem. But like a scratch that just causes more itching, the payoff never comes, and you only ruminate more.

**It’s your brain.** Because your brain is plastic (meaning flexible, not meaning the stuff you recycle), when you use certain pathways, the synapses between neurons in that pathway can become stronger.
Likewise, if you don’t use certain pathways, those may become weaker. This is also known as “Neurons that fire together, wire together”, and is what allows us to learn things, or forget others.

In practicality, this means that whatever you do a lot, you will get really good at. Throwing a lot of fastballs strengthens the connections in your brain that throw fastballs. Ruminating a lot strengthens the connections in your brain that ruminate.

But in our case, firing the rumination circuits doesn’t only make them stronger: at a certain point the circuits can take on a self-sustaining life of their own.

This is because there is evidence of physiological positive feedback mechanisms in the brain that fuel rumination. 

In the brain, some of the areas that impact the positive feedback of rumination are:

**Overactive amygdala-hippocampus:**
The amygdala (a little almond-like thing in the middle of your brain, responsible for feelings like fear, aversion, and negative moods) fires to the hippocampus (a seahorse-shaped part extending from the amygdala, responsible for episodic memory). When you ruminate, this connection becomes hyperactive, resulting in the reinforcement of negative associations with old memories.

**Underactive prefrontal cortex (PFC):**
Luckily the prefrontal cortex is able to inhibit repetitive and negative thoughts.  Parts such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exist to regulate the amygdala and hippocampus. However, in studies of people who ruminate, these areas are much more underactive than in regular controls.

**The short version:**

When you ruminate, the parts of your brain that think bad feelings and memories are overactive, and the parts of your brain that inhibit the other parts are underactive.

**It’s the system.** Finally, this all takes place within the larger context of your life, and other habits or environmental factors that affect depression.

Examples:

Ruminating may distract you or lead you to ignore opportunities for socialization (weakening social support).

Ruminating can reinforce irrational beliefs and biases (further supporting the reasoning behind ruminative thoughts).

Lethargy creates an environment where are you are inactive and lack physical distractions (leading to more rumination).

Social isolation creates an environment where there is no one to distract you or engage you in the external world (leading to more rumination).

###How to not stop rumination

Trying to solve rumination through sheer thought suppression merely backfires (known as an [ironic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory)).
If you need proof of this, try the following thought experiment:

**Don’t think of a purple elephant.**

…what did you just think of?

Thought suppression is theorized to work on two systems, a vigilance system and a distraction system. Trying to not think a thought with brute force makes the brain more sensitive to that thought (vigilance system), and when thinking something else inevitably fails (distraction system), you’re back to square one.

Research suggests that goal-oriented approaches (trying to think positive thoughts) outperform avoidance-oriented approaches (trying to not think negative thoughts).

###How do you stop rumination?

**The fastest and most simple way to short-circuit rumination is outward distraction.**
Intense physical exercise (something that makes you sweat and breathe hard) is best.

*I could write a whole separate post about physical exercise. Physical exercise is the one best “cure” for depression: in studies it beats antidepressants over the long term and is highly under-prescribed (probably because medical institutions can’t make money from it).*

Anything constructive that makes you engage with the outside world helps.

Examples: socializing, music, dancing, gardening, working with your hands.

**The most direct (but slower) way to beat rumination is to deal with the mind itself.** The best way to do this is meditation.
Meditation teaches us to not suppress thoughts (which backfires and lets them control us), but to observe them neutrally, and let them pass (as they naturally do).

The best way to start a meditation practice is to choose one technique, such as mindfulness, vipassana (insight), or concentration.

**Noting practice:**

The single technique that has helped me most to disengage from rumination is “noting practice”. The technique is to simply note whatever mental content comes up with a single-word phrase.

This is used in meditation to anchor people in the present moment and keep them from being distracted. It can also work in your everyday life. It is easy to learn, and simple to put into practice.

Examples – “Thought” **(Noting)**:

>“I have no friends.” **(Negativity), (Loneliness), (Sadness)**

>“Why did I do that one embarrassing thing a long time ago?” **(Past), (Embarrassment), (Remembering)**

>“I’m afraid I won’t pass my exams.” **(Future), (Anxiety), (Fear)**

>“I really want a donut.” **(Craving), (Wanting), (Food)**

>“My legs hurt.” **(Pain), (Aversion), (Legs)**

The point is to make notes as quickly and honestly as possible, without being drawn into worrying about accuracy, or following further down the mental trail of disassociation and spawning new mental chatter.

What this simple-but-powerful technique teaches us is to disengage from our mental chatter, see it as impermanent, and stay grounded in the present.

**Finally, the most fruitful thing you can do is to change other factors in your life that affect depression.**
Rumination will lessen as you improve other factors of the system, like becoming more physically active, doing less drugs, and socializing more.

###Conclusion

Rumination sucks. 

You can’t permanently beat the thoughts behind ruminations. Even if you’re the most successful person in the world, you will still have thoughts of doubt and negativity. If you didn’t, you would be insane. But the power of choosing to either follow these thoughts or simply let them go can be strengthened over time.

If you can become aware you are ruminating, you can beat rumination.

3,"My best and heartfelt advice to, ""I'm scared I'm losing my entire life to depression. Please help me.""","This person’s Reddit post stuck out to me, and so I wrote a detailed response to them. Perhaps some of you may find this information useful as well. Even if many of you have never felt this level of depression, everyone needs to get out of a funk once in a while. Realized I wrote this 4 years ago. Funny to see how I've changed as well. Good luck out there.

**Original Post: “I’m scared I’m going to lose my entire life to depression. Please help me.”**

*“Hi everybody. I’m a university student. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember and have self harmed since I was 9 years old. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for years and it’s pretty much a miracle that I’m still here. I’m taking antidepressants and going to therapy but my moods fluctuate all the time and I’m in the middle of a pretty bad relapse at the moment.*

*I want help. I’m tired of feeling like this. I’m tired of being way behind on my classes and I’m tired of staying in bed all day because I don’t have the will to get up and I’m tired of torturing my poor boyfriend who selflessly deals with all of my bullshit. I’m terrified of losing him because if he leaves me it will be the final straw and I don’t know how to cope after that without him.*

*I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried the no zero days and the excuse journal and I’ve tried celebrating small victories like cleaning my teeth or taking a shower and I’ve tried just forcing myself to be a functional adult but none of it works. I’ve lost my whole life to depression and I want it to go away.*

*Please help me. If you know any way that I can start getting my act together then please tell me. Depression is an illness that tries to push everyone you love away and it gets you on your own and then it kills you and I’m scared that’s the way I’m going. I want to be normal. I want to be able to go more than one day without crying and I want to be able to do my homework and I want to be able to go to my classes and I want to be able to be happy. I want to have good days. I want out of this mess. Thank you for reading.”*

**Me:** 

“Hello friend. I don’t know you but I promise that I care about you, I truly do. From a 25 year old finally finding some stability, here is what I can offer:

YES to therapy. All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn’t learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh\*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

YES to medication. It’s a booster, it won’t change everything. A mood stabilizer helped me more than an anti-depressant. It's meant to give you enough juice to do the real work, the deeper stuff, and stay on top of responsibilities. Once you are healthy for a long period of time, you can take it or taper off, your choice. 

YES to regimented sleep. I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it’s because during full moons when we didn’t have fully dark homes would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I’m a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I’m a wreck. I need 7-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication (stay away from benzo/opioids), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming.

YES to exercise. It works, it works, it works. Don’t do sh\*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom.

YES to finding self responsibility. You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35-year-old struggling son living back at home. I told her, “Sorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom’s roof.” It’s how common masculine psychology works. There are feminine equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. You would suffer through it and get to the other side. You are capable. 

YES to long term goals and short term habits. This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren’t going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning.

YES to sobriety. I don’t drink or smoke and I’m very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don’t have breakdowns. And I don’t have binges. And it is so, so much better. You’ll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

Do not flail your fists violently at depression. It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions. Not “I’m NOT a terrible person!” but, “OK, sure brain, I’m a terrible person. Here, I’m going to get up right now and knock this person’s coffee out of their hand because I’m terrible. Wait, of course I’m not going to do that. Can I really be terrible? Hm…”

YES to trusting others. Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I’ve been there. “That’s all great, but…” You are in the fog so you can’t SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing  how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end. Be well, I am here.”",1620748316.0
4,"After 20 months of medication and therapy to treat my servere depression, I just took an ""after"" picture today. I thought someone could benefit from seeing the face of a mind that has been revived.","[Here is the side-by-side comparison of my face](https://imgur.com/oAXzWFK)  


So, a little background:  

I had a violent and troubled childhood with physical, mental and sexual abuse. I have also unknowingly suffered from inattentive type ADHD simultaneously, and I was excluded from all extended family. Apart from this, I was raised by a mentally unstable single mother. As a child I feared acting out or upsetting my mother because I was scared the stress would cause her to commit suicide.  
By the time I was 15 years old I had developed a servere depression. Since I was still afraid of upsetting my mother, I refused to treat my issues in ways that affected other people, and so I started self-harming. I also started cutting off my hair during episodes and dyeing it in obnoxious colours - I had no idea of how else I could tell people that I was desperately ill, because I didn't want to tell anyone that my mother was a bad parent (again, because I feared it would upset her and push her to suicide).  

Evidently, because of an unstable situation at my home, my worsened mental state and the persistent pressure of my school and work, I broke down and ran away from home in November 2014. This was my turning point. I realised that I had been put in a situation that was completely unfair, and that I could no longer accept how I was treated.  
At that moment, I realised for the first time in my life that it was okay for my to put myself before others when I needed to do so.  

After a lot of long and tearful conversations with my mother, I moved back home, and I became increasingly aware of the fact that I was definitely, *positively* not all right. Fast forward to the day I took the ""before"" picture, I had spent some hours on subreddits, reading about depression and its symptoms. I decide I need to get help, and I make an appointment with my student counselor so I can figure out what to do. I also take a picture of my face, and then I spend the next 1.5 year waiting for the day I can take a follow-up.  


The next 6 months I was put on a sick leave to treat my depression. I start talking with a psychologist, I take anti-depressants, and after I finished my treatment I start over in school. In February this year I was officially diagnosed with inattentive type ADHD, and I have been on Ritalin for the last 4 months. Now I've been diagnosed with PCOS, a hormonal imbalance that has caused servere acne - but despite this I have never felt more happy with my situation. I considered putting on makeup or editing my ""after""pic, but evidently I decided not to - I finally feel comfortable in my own skin; acne, redness and scars from self-harm included.  

I'm sorry if I posted this in the wrong place. I just wanted to share this in the hopes of helping someone overcoming their demons. You can withstand far more battle than you think. You can fight it all. I'm not saying it's easy or that it's a matter of ""just believing in yourself"". It's hard. But it's worth it. And you can do it.",1473437302.0
5,"After a bad breakup, I found myself dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety. This is for anyone who needs to hear this today ..","It won't be at the bottom of a bottle, or at the end of a cigarette. It will not be at 2am in the arms of someone else. Or on the tear streaked shoulder of a friend. It won't be easy, nor fun, nor fast. 

This is how you fall out of love. It will be slow, and it will be painful; like slowly ripping off a bandaid, except much fucking worse. It will be gradual, like the coming of spring. Their memory will linger like stale cigarette smoke. Your senses will be deprived of their touch, their scent, their taste. The flashbacks will bring tears to your eyes and they will hit you at the most inopportune of times. A stranger will smile at you and you'll wish they weren't around to see you cry. 

This is how you will fall out of love. You will catch yourself not flinching at the mention of their name. You will speak of them in past tense, and not feel the need to correct yourself. Missing them will come in waves. On nights where you are drowning you will not reach for the phone; as desperately as you want to. Instead you will turn out the lights and fall asleep alone knowing they aren't beside you. You will find yourself staring at your reflection in the mirror and smiling. You will remember the way they kissed your cheeks but you will not miss them. You will allow yourself that smile because you are here, it is today and it is one step further from the last.

You will forgive them. You will forgive yourself. You will stop imagining a future where you meet up 10 years from now and start anew. There is no starting over. You will have many sleepless nights but one day you will stop dreaming of them when you do. You will fall out of love with them, they will fall out of love with you, and It will forever change your perception of what love really was or is. 

This is how you will fall out of love. You will realize that you could never promise forever. You will be greatfull for what once was and excited for what is yet to be. You are worth it, you are not broken and you will be okay.",1453818966.0
6,"Thankfully, I hanged myself in the barn.","I originally posted this on /r/offmychest, but after recommendation from /u/RedErin, I'm posting it here as well.


Two years ago I decided to hang myself. After I had made that decision I remember feeling a strong sense of relief and inner calmness that made me even more certain with the decision I had just made. I went to work as usual, and after I went straight to the store and bought myself a rope and headed home to do the deed. I figured the outside barn was as good as place as any, so I threw the rope over the beam and set everything up, and in no-time I was standing ready on the chair. I put my foot on the seat back, and as I was about to ride the chair down towards the floor, I experienced a flash memory of myself doing exactly that as a kid. I could feel just how fun doing that was back then, and it was at that moment I knew that I wanted to live. But it was too late. Not mere moments ago, but right now, it was too late. Too late to fix everything that was wrong with my life, too late to fix what I had just done.

I don't remember what happend after having that epiphany, only that I woke up on the floor with a broken beam above me. I am alive, I thought. I AM ALIVE.

Today, I am a happy man. Today, I have a girlfriend as of eight months and engaged for two. Today, I have friends. Not many but a few really good ones. I cherish these people above all else and I will always be there for them as I know they will always be there for me.

7,I sold my guns.,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

I’m out of school, never worked. I haven’t had friends in 2 years (not interested atm), I lost all of my hobbies, interests and goals in life due to my crippling depression. I suffer from severe social isolation, I only see humans through my screen but I’m not directly talking to anyone, so it messes with my brain and how I connect to people. I’m on my iPad for 17 hours on average each day, with 7-8 hours of sleep. I am on my iPad the entire day, with only exception if I need to go to the bathroom or make food. Recently I’ve been ordering food online because I ran out of food and even making the simplest meals are too much effort. I can’t even get out of bed, walk downstairs and grab a snack because it requires too much energy, even chewing my food is too exhausting. I feel paralyzed. I have to suffer in this state for months on end until some magic happens, like my medication works or therapy helps. I’ve been in this state for over a year now of constant pain without any way of leaving it unless I go to sleep. But once I wake up the depression and anxious thoughts kick in. It’s a never ending cycle. At this point there really isn’t anything you can do to help me. I’ve been complaining on mental health subs for years, any advice or tips hasn’t improved my mental state. I haven’t changed my mind about suicide in 2 years now. If I had access to some pills that would surely do it or a shotgun I would do it. I can’t even let my brain relax for 5 seconds or the negative and suicidal thoughts kick in telling me to kill myself, putting me in a constant unattached state of mind, which inevitably results in DPDR episodes. These past 2 months have blended in so much that I genuinely thought it was March 1st today. I’ve been so depressed recently that I piss in bottles even though the bathroom is directly across from my room. My room is covered in garbage and dishes. 

Realistically speaking I just want this post to be upvoted so people can see how much pain I’m in. I just need some attention to be brutally honest. If I don’t get enough attention in general, I will go to the hospital for psych evaluation and get admitted to the ward. But that doesn’t change anything, I’m still depressed. I don’t care, I’ll kill myself. I’ll do it like it’s nothing. If I become manic my chances of killing myself are very high. I don’t think I’ll live long. I said I was going to kill myself in summer last year but I got too depressed to actually put in the effort to do it.

Within the last year I discovered something that seems to have changed my life.

I've developed what worked into what I call ""good dog theory"". The idea is that you are not your brain, your brain is just this thing that's there and it's really helpful and does lots of cool stuff like help you think about things and makes your body move around and breathe. But it's not you, and as such it does not know what you like, but it wants to help you. It's like a dog that wants nothing more out of life than to prove to you that it loves you, but all it can do is act and see how you respond.

If your dog pees on the rug, and you give it a treat, it will pee on the rug again, thinking that's what you like. But if you tell it ""no"" and bring it outside as soon as it happens, it slowly learns that it's supposed to go outside, and its impulse will change from ""pee on rug"" to ""let's go outside"".

Imagine a terrible day is your dog peeing on the rug. A lot of people, myself included, get the impulse to drink away the resulting misery. But alcohol is a depressant. So by having a drink, you're giving the dog a treat for peeing on the rug. Your brain does not know what you like, it just makes chemicals and you have to deal with them, so by exacerbating the misery, you're telling your brain that's what you like. So next time something bad happens and you spiral, your impulse is to go for the bottle. Or whatever your darkness manifests as.

In order to change the impulse, you have to teach your brain that you actually like the chemicals that make you happy, and those are the ones you'd prefer to feel after something pushes you towards the edge. Something like going for a run that releases endorphins is going to teach your brain you don't like feeling bad. That run is like taking your dog outside to teach it where it's supposed to pee.

I know how hard it can be to force yourself to do those things, but there are easy ways to start. Basically, it's about starting with easy good habits that feel good, and those good habits will breed other good habits, just like bad habits breed bad ones. Things like going for a run when you feel okay, or any kind of exercise, is a big one. Eating healthy helps a lot. Bonus points if you like cooking, it's like an hour or so every meal where you're creating something for yourself, and then enjoying the fruits of your labor. If you're at all creative in any other way, act on it when you're feeling okay. I know these things may sound too simple to be effective, but once you get into the habit of them, you can start to force yourself to do the hard ones more easily. After a while when you have a bad day, force yourself to go for that run instead of whatever you normally do that sticks you in your misery. Teach your brain that you're not actually into being depressed and/or feeling like absolute shit, and you'd rather have the good stuff. If you can do that, it won't be long before you've altered your impulses so that instead of forcing it, you actually FEEL like going for a run when something makes you feel awful.

This also has the added bonus of centering you in yourself, essentially turning off all the external forces and becoming internally motivated, which means other people and situations can't hurt you so easily.

It's about separating yourself from your emotional state just enough to start to trick your brain into doing things that are good for it instead of bad for it. I can't promise this will work for everyone, but I've told a few people about this concept in real life and here on reddit and so far it seems to be working for them.

Within the last two months, I found myself in two separate situations with different women that, a year ago, would have sent me into a downward spiral that would have thrown me into complete paralysis, but within a few minutes I was able to shrug them off and move on with my life. I was even drunk when both of them happened, which usually makes things way worse for me and pushes me into suicidal range. I haven't been dwelling on them at all, and still feel really good for the first time since I was probably 10.

I hope none of this comes off as preachy. This isn't about my success story or anything, it's just that after a quarter century of wishing I could just be someone else for 5 fucking minutes or die or anything really, I finally found something that seems like it's changed the game for good, and I want to spread the word in hopes that it will help other people.

15,What do I do when nothing interests me?,"Nothing interests me, and I don't enjoy anything. It's been this way for at least two years now. I am a functional person (showering, working), but my nights and weekends consist of distractions (TV, games, books) until I can sleep. If it matters, I'm a 25yo guy.


> What do you enjoy? Try writing a list of things you want to do. Try finding a hobby.

I don't enjoy anything, and I have zero goals/dreams/aspirations. I cannot find a hobby that appeals to me. I live in a major US city, so I'm not lacking for activities. I literally read through lists of hobbies every few weeks and come up empty.

> You should get out of your comfort zone.

And go where? I am completely directionless.

> Doesn't matter, you need to expose yourself to something different.

Honestly, how do I distinguish between directions? I'm afraid of heights, so I'm confident that I won't like skydiving. The things I come across seem either boring or unpleasant.


> You need to try random things until something sticks.

Man, this is such a depressing one. It feels like a suggestion to play the lottery. When I say that no hobby appeals to me, I really mean it. Seems like finding a needle in a haystack, something that could take decades. I guess I'm not desperate enough to do this yet.

> Medication?

Wellbutrin and Vitamin D for a year. I haven't noticed an improvement.

> Friends?

I don't have friends or a social life. I'm okay with that, and don't feel lonely or like an outcast.

> Therapy?

On my to-do list. But I'm having a hard time believing that therapy will help. I keep looking for ways to deal with anhedonia, but the suggestions I come across don't make any sense to me.

> Like exercise?

Yeah. And I don't exercise now. I just don't get how getting my heart rate up is going to make me suddenly interested in a hobby. From what I've read, exercise helps to stabilize. I don't have the lows or the highs, so I feel ""too stable"" (if there is such a thing).

> What about mindfulness/meditation?

Perhaps I've misunderstood the concepts, but the idea of ""watching your thoughts go by"" doesn't seem useful to me. That seems like turning your brain off, and I don't see how I'm going to figure this out without spending time thinking about the problem. I don't think about this all the time, but during the occasional lull at work there's littles else to think about.

> Volunteering?

I've done enough volunteering (hundreds of hours) to know that it doesn't do anything for me. I only mention the amount of time to make it clear that I've given it a fair shot.

> Did this start suddenly? Is there a reason?

Not that I can tell. I haven't been abused or hurt by anyone or anything. I've never been a particularly excited or engaged person, but things have never been this bad. I suspect this started sometime during college, but I only realized my situation a couple of years ago. There isn't anyone or anything standing in between me and some desire of mine. It's that I don't have a desire to begin with. A car with a full tank of gas doesn't matter if you don't know where you are going.


> Well, you seem to have all the answers, and don't seem willing to do anything.

I hope you believe me when I say that's not my intention. I honestly don't know how to force myself to do things that I don't think will help. I've tried to anticipate some of the common questions. Am I thinking about things incorrectly? Do I just need to suck it up and do something?

**Original Post: “I’m scared I’m going to lose my entire life to depression. Please help me.”**

“Hi everybody. I’m a university student. I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember and have self harmed since I was 9 years old. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts for years and it’s pretty much a miracle that I’m still here. I’m taking antidepressants and going to therapy but my moods fluctuate all the time and I’m in the middle of a pretty bad relapse at the moment.

I want help. I’m tired of feeling like this. I’m tired of being way behind on my classes and I’m tired of staying in bed all day because I don’t have the will to get up and I’m tired of torturing my poor boyfriend who selflessly deals with all of my bullshit. I’m terrified of losing him because if he leaves me it will be the final straw and I don’t know how to cope after that without him.

I’ve tried everything. I’ve tried the no zero days and the excuse journal and I’ve tried celebrating small victories like cleaning my teeth or taking a shower and I’ve tried just forcing myself to be a functional adult but none of it works. I’ve lost my whole life to depression and I want it to go away.

Please help me. If you know any way that I can start getting my act together then please tell me. Depression is an illness that tries to push everyone you love away and it gets you on your own and then it kills you and I’m scared that’s the way I’m going. I want to be normal. I want to be able to go more than one day without crying and I want to be able to do my homework and I want to be able to go to my classes and I want to be able to be happy. I want to have good days. I want out of this mess. Thank you for reading.”

**My Response:** 

“Hello friend. I don’t know you but I promise that I care about you, I truly do. From a 25 year old finally finding some stability, here is what I can offer:

**YES to therapy.** All of it. And not just the stuff that gives you tools on how to manage your depression, but the deep, deep childhood Jungian stuff. If I didn’t learn why I was how I was, and then go through this year of anger and sadness, and then take the necessary steps to change what I needed to change, I would never get out of the pit. You usually ask yourself, ""What made me physically ill?"". Now, ask yourself, ""What made me mentally ill?"" Good therapy is swimming through the river of sh*t so you can get to the dry bank on the other side.

**YES to medication.** It’s a booster, it won’t change everything. You might have more luck with mood stabilizers instead of anti-depressants. And, we are currently in an anti-depressant epidemic, so that always felt a little more comfortable for me. But that is just ego, don’t let it get to you.

**YES to regimented sleep.** I mean this. You know the word lunacy or lunatic? It comes from luna, the moon. And it’s because during full moons when we didn’t have fully dark homes it would keep people up, and it would trigger mania in bipolar. If I sleep 5 hours, I’m a wreck. If I sleep 9 hours, I’m a wreck. I need 7-8 like clockwork, and it seriously takes me from a 2/10 to a 7/10. Do whatever you can to manage this: yellow light glasses, sleeping medication (stay away from benzo/opioids), job changes, anything. The studies on this keep on coming.

**YES to exercise.** It works, it works, it works. Don’t do sh*t you hate: if you hate running, lift. If you hate lifting, do yoga. Do it, celebrate every workout, breathe in the endorphin freedom.

**YES to finding self responsibility.** You will never heal without it. I recently talked to a woman with a 35-year-old bipolar son living back at home. I told her, “Sorry mom. I know you want to love him, and I know he is in pain, but he will never heal if he is still under mom’s roof.” It’s just how male psychology works. I know you are female, but there are equivalents to this; such as you saying losing your partner would be the end of it. I am absolutely in LOVE with my current partner. I feel the same way. But technically, I do not NEED her. She doesn’t feed me, or pay my bills, or organize my hiking trips (now if I didn’t have those, that’s another story…). So you must find self-reliance. You can, and you will.

**YES to long term goals and short term habits.** This is called Kaizen. Your small victories are not working because they aren’t going anywhere. I know we are told to celebrate the showers and the little stuff, and sometimes that helps, but you need to celebrate the showers because that means you are one step closer to X. Being self-reliant. Volunteering for a cause. Travelling. Getting in great shape. Start with your values, create a self-mission statement, set five year goals, and break those all the way down to literally what you have to do TODAY to reach it. Write one sentence of a book. Do one pushup. Now these things have meaning.

**YES to sobriety.** I don’t drink or smoke and I’m very bored and it sucks. But I am stable. And I don’t have breakdowns. And I don’t have binges. And it is so, so much better. You’ll find a whole new world of health and friendships to explore.

**Do not flail your fists violently at depression.** It is a fog, it cannot be beat that way. You must be calm, collected, slow and steady. You must wake up to good music, cook a good breakfast, get out the door. Get out the door, every single day. Go to a coffee shop and read, whatever.

**You must confront your ineffective thoughts with questions.** Not “I’m NOT a terrible person!” but, “OK, sure brain, I’m a terrible person. Here, I’m going to get up right now and knock this person’s coffee out of their hand because I’m terrible. Wait, of course I’m not going to do that. Can I really be terrible? Hm…”

**YES to trusting others.** Everything I just said above, depression has given you reasons and excuses why it will not work. I’ve been there. “That’s all great, but…” You are in the fog so you can’t SEE. We can see you, though. I can see you be happy, healthy, stable, strong. I can see you get down like we all do, but knowing  how to manage it correctly and knowing it will end. Be well, I am here.”

**More advice and encouragement from others:**

“I read your comment and I immediately called my school’s counseling service to make an appointment. Something resonated with me and made me realize that I’m not okay, but that things don’t have to be this way. Thank you so much.” 

“Exercise. It doesn’t matter what you do: walk, run, jog, whatever. It doesn’t matter how out of shape you are. Just get outside and do something physical. You will be amazed at how good you feel after a hard hour of exercise.”

“This advice is amazing. Do this. Do all of this. You can do it! Don’t forget that alongside your habits you need to change how you speak! Speak in positives. That was what finally got me off of the medication. Don’t say, “I can’t.” Say, “My obstacle is…” Don’t say, “I don’t think I can…”, say “I think the thing standing in my way the most is”. Quantify your enemy. The enemy is not you, the enemy is your brain making you think negatively. So fight that. Fight it in every sentence you form.”

18,Depression: So much more than a chemical imbalance,"The notion that depression is largely due to a chemical imbalance is, well.. let’s just say that the “chemical imbalance” story is played out, and it never had much legs to begin with. And I get it, if you’ve bought into this story like I did, you’re probably pretty triggered right now. But stay with me if you can, because I want to challenge your existing beliefs and get some cognitive dissonance going.

I’m not saying that brain chemicals like serotonin don’t play a role in this **very** complex equation. I’m just saying that there is so much more to this story than we realize and that’s very important to acknowledge. I’m sure you’ve heard people say that someone with depression is just like a diabetic: you take your anti-depressants just like they take their insulin, and there should be no stigma about it.

Well yes stigma is bad, but no depression is not that simple. If you buy into that story, you’ll be quick to pop that pill and believe there is nothing further that needs doing. You will also be more likely to believe that recovery is out of your control. For me, this thinking was a very big mistake as I pissed away most of my 20’s thinking that all was well, only to realize that my sense of dread, worry, fear never actually resolved itself. It was only when I started doing the inner work (going to therapy, reading books, meditating, fixing my diet, exercising, understanding the way the world works, etc) that I realized oh shit.. there are **so** many legitimate reasons why I’ve been depressed for so long!

To be clear, I’m not saying that anti-depressants don’t work, or that they can’t play an important role in one’s path to healing. I use to think like that, but after seeing the way these drugs can stabilize a person (including myself), I don’t longer cast such extreme judgement. My main message here is that there are so many reasons why so many people are depressed and deeply unhappy in today’s world, and we need to start talking about all those reasons.. because recognition of the root causes leads to understanding of the true cure.

Let’s start with the reasons external to you. Western society is **deeply and** **profoundly** sick on nearly every level imaginable. We are essentially free-range slaves working jobs that don’t fulfill us so that we can earn money and buy shit to impress people we don’t even like. Our sense of meaning, purpose, passion and adventure that is so intrinsic to our true nature is completely absent. We’ve become increasingly more disconnected to each other, to human connection, community, friendship, love. It’s now even trendy for humans to hate on other humans (as is often portrayed by people who prefer the company of their dogs over any other person, for example).

Our diets are absolutely shit and the food we consume (and the way we consume it) is killing us from the inside out. We spend most of our time indoors, glued to technology rather than moving our bodies, playing and being in nature. Our attention span is shot. Social media exposes us to false depictions of reality that we compare ourselves to, we get bullied and we feel inadequate like we’ll never be good enough for the world. We’re constantly being advertised and sold to, as we dig ourselves deeper and deeper into materialistic consumerism that chains us to the comfy jobs that drain our soul.

And what do we do in the face of all this despair? We numb. Ohhh we are **so** professional number’s. Alcohol, TV, Netflix, weed, games, porn, etc. The endless access to quick/cheap distractions and indulges make it so easy for us to stuff the despair deep, *deep* down where we don’t have to feel the pain.. until we do. And when we do, we have no clue where the pain is coming from, why we are depressed and why we feel completely unable to “think” our way out of it.

And how about the internal reasons why we are depressed? The way we think is directly related to the reality we experience. If you feel like you live in a hostile world for example, your mind makes it so. You can have two different people with an identical circumstances (location, upbringing, social status, etc.) and each can have a completely different experience of reality based on the way they think.

So how do most people, depressed or not, think? First of all, they think from their ego. I don’t mean ego in the Western sense of someone who is arrogant; I mean ego in the Eastern sense of the over-identification with ourselves as separate beings from the world around us. This ego speaks through our thoughts, and believe it or not, that is not who we are. That is actually just a reflection of all our past experiences (upbringing, education, traumas, the media we consume, etc). We think all of this nonsense is our individual selves, but in reality it’s actually just an identity that has been programmed into us.

And how do we think and behave from this ego? This is where fear, worry, judgement, hate, jealousy, envy, shame, guilt, inadequacy, etc all stems from. When we over-identify with this part of our being, we are inherently controlled by it. Our emotions become victims to these automatic, unconscious thoughts and reactions to our experience of reality. And until you realize this, it seems like there is no way out. “It’s going to be like this forever”, I use to tell myself.

But the reality is, you do have control over this. It takes a lot of work and it’s certainly no easy thing, but you absolutely can take back control of your thoughts, feelings and emotions over time. It took me many years of inner work to realize this, and that’s at least how long I’d expect it to take for you. But it gets better and better along the way, and sometimes it also doesn’t. Two steps forward, one step back as they say.

I know it’s considered a sin to suggest that we bare any responsibility for the way we feel, but I would like to speak to those who are ready to own that responsibility and finally put an end to the victim-hood mentality that’s keeping you stuck. I’m not saying you don’t have significant circumstances that contributed to your current state of well-being (abusive father, neglecting parents, bullying, sexual traumas, etc). All of those things are very real, and very valid. But living for the rest of your life as a victim to your past/present circumstances is a choice.

Anyway this only scratches the surface of my thoughts on depression and why so many people today are unhappy. The world is fucked up in so many ways, and whatever your circumstances or your genetic makeup, you’ve become fucked up right along with it (while all the “normal” people run around like nothing is wrong). Well let me tell you, many of them are hurting too. Maybe they don’t realize it, or maybe they’ve just mastered the art of living unconsciously. Ignorance is bliss as they say. But the message here is, there is hope. If you want to get better, there is a path. Believe it.",1568591880.0
19,"Why people with depression don't want to get better, and what you can do about it.","We’ve all heard this parable before:

*One day a man was walking by some elephants, when he suddenly stopped, confused as to why such powerful creatures were being restrained with nothing more than a rope. It was obvious the elephants could at any time break free, but for some reason, they did not.*

*Seeing a trainer nearby, he asked why the elephants did not break loose, as they obviously had the power to break free. The trainer answered that as babies, the elephants are tied with ropes and that is enough to hold them. As they grow older, they still believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break free.*

*The man was amazed. The animals could at any time break their bonds, but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.*

**This is a state known as “learned helplessness”.** Learned helplessness happens when a person believes they have no power over a situation, and consequently give up trying to change their condition.

###Why is this important for depression?

Learned helplessness doesn’t only happen in elephants. It also happens in abusive relationships, homeless shelters, classrooms, nursing homes, and prisons.

Learned helplessness is very relevant to depression because depressed people often feel a lack of control and sense of hopelessness in their lives. Being depressed for months or years on end creates the illusion that your depression is permanent. And why even try to escape when you have learned there is no point?

###The origin of learned helplessness

The concept of learned helplessness was discovered by accident.  In the 1960’s, psychologist Martin Seligman was experimenting on dogs, trying to establish a relationship between fear and learning. Seligman believed that shocking dogs would cause them to learn a behavior faster.

In the experiment, dogs were restrained in hammock-like harnesses. Pairs of dogs would receive electric shocks of the same intensity and duration, with one difference. One dog had a lever that it could press to end the shocks, while the other had a lever that did nothing. A control group of dogs was restrained without receiving shocks at all.

In the next part of the experiment, the dogs were placed in a room with an electrified floor, divided by a low fence. This time, when the dogs were shocked, they could avoid the pain by jumping over the fence.

What Seligman found was unexpected. When the lever dogs and control dogs were shocked, they predictably jumped over the fence to avoid pain. However, when the dogs with the dummy lever were shocked, they responded by lying on the floor and whining.

When the shocks came, and the dogs had complete freedom to jump over the fence, they would instead simply lie down and suffer. The third group of dogs had learned that there was no way of escaping the shocks, and ended up suffering when in reality nothing was stopping them from escape.

###Where does learned helplessness come from?

Seligman and others recognized that learned helplessness in dogs was similar to depression in humans. Expanding their research on learned helplessness, Seligman and others linked learned helplessness to the ways people explain the world. They called this “explanatory style”.

####The three elements of explanatory style:

**Personalization (internal vs. external):** How one explains the cause of an event. People may blame themselves for an event (internal attribution) or blame external factors (external attribution).

*Examples:*

*“I failed the test because I’m stupid.”* (personal/internal)

*“That test must have been harder than usual.”* (impersonal/external)

**Permanence (stable vs. unstable):** How one explains the extent of a cause. People see the causes of things as stable (unchanging, or permanent) or unstable (changing, or temporary).

*Examples:*

*“I always fail.”* (stable)

*“I didn’t do my best today”* (unstable)

**Pervasiveness (global vs. local):** How one explains the extent of the effects. People can generalize events (making them pervasive or global) or compartmentalize them (making them local or specific).

Examples:

*“I fail at everything.”* (global)

*“I failed math, but at least I’m passing my other classes.”* (local)

Generally, people with a pessimistic explanatory style see things as personal, stable, and global. They will blame things on themselves, do not believe that they can change, and see events as affecting their entire lives.

People with optimistic explanatory style see things as situational, unstable, and local. They are more likely to blame events on external circumstances as well as see things as temporary and localized.

Pessimistic explanatory style is linked to depression as well as higher chances of poor health, infectious disease, and early mortality.

###How is learned helplessness prevented?

Later, when escaping dogs were put in the harness with dummy levers (the inescapable condition) then returned to the shuttlebox, they still tried to escape. The dogs had learned early on that if they tried, eventually shocks could be avoided, making them immune to learned helplessness.

The learned helplessness dogs could be taught to avoid the shocks, but this took at least two trials of the researchers moving their paws and teaching them to jump over the fence (threats, rewards, and demonstrations had no effect).

So how do we prevent learned helplessness in real life, as humans?

####1. Learned optimism

Seligman believed that just as people can develop learned helplessness, they can also develop learned optimism. Learned optimism can help strengthen psychological resilience and fight reactions of learned helplessness.

The most crucial step in developing learned optimism is to understand that learned helplessness is not an inherent personality trait.  Remember that the components of optimistic explanatory style are seeing events as impersonal, temporary, and specific.

One way of unlearning learned helplessness is cognitive behavioral therapy.

####2. Small wins

Accumulating “small wins” is a powerful way to increase motivation and feelings of control.

Accomplishing one small task can lead to better morale, which can make you feel more motivated to tackle the next task. When you succeed at a small task, the larger tasks seem doable.

Any “small wins” such as paying bills, cleaning a room, taking a walk, or getting something done are not only constructive, but also build feelings of control and self-efficacy.

Another way small wins help is by taking control of your environment.

A 1976 study by Langer and Rodin showed that elderly people in nursing homes who were allowed to choose their own house plants and decide when to have film night were more active, alert, and happier than a control group which had decisions made for them.

In a follow up study 18 months later, the group that took responsibility for their choices had a mortality rate of 15%, while the helpless control group had a mortality rate of 30%.

####3. Decrease stress response

One way to decrease stress response and make the brain more stress-resistant is exercise. Studies of rats showed those who voluntarily ran on exercise wheels had a decreased response to uncontrollable (learned helplessness-inducing) stress.

###Conclusion

The reason learned helplessness is so vicious is that it is self-fulfilling prophecy. By perceiving no control, you give up, losing what control you actually have. In addition, learned helplessness not only leads to depression and poor health, but also inhibits you from recovering control.

####What to do if you’re dealing with someone who is depressed

If you are a non-depressed person dealing with someone who has depression, the best you can do is to be patient.

While to you it may seem obvious that not trying to get better is keeping them depressed, understand learned helplessness itself is part of the disease. At some level, a person with depression may not want to help themselves.

####What to do if you’re depressed

If you have depression and are affected by learned helplessness, you probably feel there is no way out. Understand this feeling is a part of your disease and keeps you in the cycle of depression.

Realize that learned helplessness is (1) caused by uncontrollable stressors, and (2) is most likely to occur in people with a pessimistic explanatory style.

The best way to fight this is (1) develop learned optimism, (2) accumulate “small wins”, and (3) fight stress with exercise.

20,I can't find a way to vent my anger at this pointless shit world we live in.,"I'm working-class. There's no hope for me of ever getting out of the corporate production line. I'm a slave, and I'll be a slave until I die. My entire life exists to enrich a few parasites at the top, and nobody around me seems to care. Most people think that is the right way, the meaning of life. I don't. I don't want to serve. I don't want to be a slave. There's no other way, though. There will be no revolution. Nobody will ever remove the rich from power. I was born a slave, and I'll die a slave, and I can't even fight for my freedom in any way. So what do I do with this anger? I've been hurting myself, punching things, but it's pointless. If I could, I'd grind Jeff Bezos' head into a fine paste with just my fists, and then I could die happy knowing I'd slain the closest thing reality has to an actual dragon. But I can't. I'm pathetic and worthless, and I want to die but I can't. There's nothing I can do. I don't even own myself.",1622363868.0
21,I wrote these guidelines to help with own depression. I hope they can help you too.,"I felt compelled to write these guidelines in order to challenge my own depression and other mental struggles. It’s a way for me to talk back to myself when I’m starting to slip, but I also want to share this with all of you in case it can be helpful to anyone suffering from similar mental illness. 

So here I’ve written 11 guidelines that I personally use everyday to mitigate and mostly  overcome my own depression. For me, these have worked consistently and effectively, and I hope they can for you too!

I also want to say that of course everybody’s mental situation is unique and comes from different reasons and causes, so these methods may not work for you or even be relevant to you, but my hope is that something is found to be useful!



**- Intro -**

I’ve spent the 2nd half of my life fighting with depression. It has given me tremendous difficulty. I’ve spent much of my life feeling hopeless, worthless, pointless, insecure, incapable, alone, terrible, unredeemable, undeserving, among many other things. While it’s not totally cured, due to a radical change in perspective I’ve managed to regain control of my life.

I can’t express here the prison that depression is, but what I can do is give you mental health advice that’s worked for me. Don’t confuse me with a medical professional, because I am not! This is purely my experience. 

I also don’t want to conflate depression with negative feelings like generally being sad. They are not the same and I will try not to phrase them as the same, but they do share many overlapping characteristics. In my case, most of these guidelines helped both. 

Before I start, I need to emphasize that to effectively combat this beast, this needs to be converted fully to an internal battle. You have to isolate it within yourself, because yourself is the only thing that you have (mostly) full control over. Putting reliance on outside elements (like people or objects) to withhold your positive mental state will NOT offer a permanent or reliably-consistent solution. 

This is about CURING or mitigating depression, not delaying it. Because of this, you may notice that none of these suggestions below will be along the lines of “have a healthy support group”, or “take anti-depressants”. Now I need to clarify these: Support groups ARE important and you should find them and talk with them! I’ll talk with you! And if medicine is what works best for you then I encourage you to continue doing that. There is zero shame in that! 

But in relevance to this strategy, those methods are not purposeful to the greater message I’m trying to convey here. If you want to reduce or defeat this dark feeling inside of you for good, it will ultimately have to come from within YOU, or it will always come back. I am not discrediting the effectiveness of healthy support groups or medicine because they help immensely, but neither offer a permanent solution as they’re volatile and may not always be available. 



Let’s get started!


**1 - To change your story, you have to change your perspective.**

Outside influences will always affect your mental state. People; work; school; relationships, ect, and that’s normal! But it’s how these external elements filter through your brain that decides how you feel. That filter is what needs to be recognized and adjusted. 

Is the glass half empty, or half full? The glass isn’t different either way, but your mind will make you feel something completely different depending on how you percieve it. What you mentally feel is strongly based on the lens that is used to look at situations in your life.

I can’t speak for you, but learning to become more in-tune with my mental state, and how I percieve things has done well for me and allowed me to control and shape my emotional responses so much more efficiently and appropriately. 



**2 - Build your foundations under yourself, not others.**

People can’t or won’t always be there for you. It’s not always malicious; people need to take care of their own life too.

Having a reliance on external objects to maintain your positive mental health will only leave you vastly underprepared when the moment comes to rely on yourself. You DON’T want to be caught in that moment, it will do a lot damage, and will take a lot of time to recover out of. Save yourself from the long term pain and invest time into yourself; learn to be strong from within YOU, because you ARE capable of it. Trust me, if I can do it, there’s nobody who can’t. 

I’m also not suggesting that you shouldn’t put any emotional stakes into anybody or anything. I’m only saying that there will be a time when that element might not be there anymore, and you should always try and be in a place where you can maintain your healthy mental posture even without it. 



**3 - Don’t regret your mistakes; see them as opportunities to learn.**

“If you focus on the hurt, you will continue to suffer.
If you focus on the lesson, you will continue to grow.”

For me, a substantial chunk of my depression came from looking back on my poor decisions. I spent many years hating myself; feeling like I was a horrible person; worthless and undeserving of good things; even life itself at times. 

Yes, mistakes can have significant consequences; you might lose a friend, or hurt somebody, or worse. But that situation has given you the opportunity to be a better person. It’s given you knowledge and experience that you didn’t have previously. This is how you become the best possible version of yourself. But this only works if you can be honest with yourself about what needs to change. 

It’s a fundamental part of life to make mistakes. That mistake can be as small as a lie, or as big as murder. This is an internal battle, with YOU and only you, and I believe that as long as you can be honest with yourself, that you can use any mistake and transform it into a lesson and opportunity to better yourself.

This does NOT justify the action(s), but the key here is to look at mistakes differently. Look at them as if they’re something filled with purpose, because they truly ARE! Don’t regret your mistakes; respect them. This isn’t just BS to tell yourself to make you feel better. It’s justified, because trial-and-error and experience is fundamentally what helps us grow as people. Mistakes are ‘meant’ to be lessons. Nobody is so perfect that they never make them. 

Own the mistake; don’t let it own you. 



**4 - Don’t be stagnant.**

I can understand if for some people responsibility is maybe the reason for their depression and/or daily sense of dread and sadness. I guess it depends on what that responsibility is and if it’s doing something positive or negative for you personally. 

In my case, the lack of responsibility or productiveness contributed heavily to my depression, and how I felt about myself in general. My self-security was at its record low at the most physically stagnant point of my life. I felt worthless. I felt like my existence was pointless; I wasn’t contributing to anything and my life was going nowhere. 

I decided to go back to college and pursue a useful degree, as well as started working again. Even though my schedule went from empty to busy 24/7, which was extremely overwhelming at first, it was exactly what I needed, and I instantaneously began to feel better about myself in ways that I didn’t think I ever could. The progress I’ve made because of those decisions has been incredible to witness. This is one of the biggest factors in me being able to reclaim my humanity. 

It also gave me more things to talk and relate to people about. If socializing with people is a difficulty for you like it is for me often, having a busier life can greatly contribute to making it easier to talk with people, and meet people! Sometimes isolation is a strong influence for dark feelings, and learning to overcome social barriers will curb that!

Anyways, my point here is that responsibility shouldn’t be something to be afraid of. It’s something that makes us feel human and fills us with purpose!



**5 - Acceptance.**

Some things are just out of our control. We can spend a lot of time dwelling on these things as if we can influence or change them, and it takes up unneasary space in our brains. Clear the cache wherever possible!

Maybe it’s a terrible reality. This example a bit graphic in concept, but imagine you’re about to die. There are people who find calmness in those last few moments because they internally accept the reality of what’s happening. Even in the face of death, they’re able regain and retain control of themselves.

It’s a powerful thing to think about, and that same mentality can be applied wherever it needs to be in your life. Only you can define the things in your life that you know that you can’t change. 


**6 - Forgiveness.**

Just as I’ve hurt people, people have also hurt me. The mental danger here is that it’s easy to allow feelings of hurt to grab hold of your life. It can make you sad (obviously), but also very upset and even angry. This is not good, and it will blind you from being able to reason with yourself. Any powerful emotions can do that. 

I learned through many months and years of emotional struggle with this that this isn’t the way. I could not figure out how to overcome these powerful feelings of hurt and betrayal. And then through time, I finally understood the purpose of forgiveness.

Even though you may not think that the situation is justifiable, understand that forgiveness is letting it go DESPITE how you feel that you were wronged.

If this is something that you deal with, just know that when you’re finally able to let this stuff go, it will bring you among the most powerful sense of mental peace and freedom. 

It’s only a shift of perspective, again. So much of this is all about perspective. It’s not about “forgetting”; you don’t forget these things, but the change of perspective allows you to respect and ACCEPT the situation. It allows you to regain control of yourself. 


**7 - Apologize.**

I can’t stress this enough. Do not apologize for things that you don’t believe that you did wrong. This goes into another step about fakeness that we’ll get to. But this is why you need to be honest with yourself, because some things are worth apologizing for, and you should. 

I’m saying apologize rather than ask for forgiveness, because it’s nobodies job to forgive you or me. Don’t apologize with their forgiveness for you in mind; apologize because you deeply and genuinely feel that you were wrong, despite how the other person still feels about you. 

Many of these guidelines are simply about cutting off the mental baggage weighing you down. Every rope that you cut gives you more flexibility to breathe and be free. 



**8 - Be genuinely you, and don’t look for affirmation from anybody.**

I allowed how I felt about myself to be dictated by people all my life, and it only gave me struggles. I felt like a terrible person, and that I needed to constantly conform to the mindsets of the people around me in order to fit in and be accepted. Do not let this happen to you, you are destroying your own identity, and your right to your own beliefs. 

When I was letting this happen to me, I felt no sense of identity. It made me feel like I didn’t earn this, whatever it was. Everything felt ingenuine. This was one of the primary factors for my plummeted self-security. 

When you become real, you establish a sense of meaning. It will make you feel stronger about yourself, and that everything in your life is there because of YOU. 

I’ve lost friends because of this, and while I’m still sad about all of these lost connections despite our differences, I am content with being true, honest, and accepting of myself.

Take time to meditate and learn to stop caring what people think of you. You don’t have to live up to anybody’s standards for what you should be and think. You are an individual with purpose and meaning. Be you, and understand why you are who you are. 



**9 - Remove daily pressures as early as possible.**

I know this is one a lot of people really don’t want to hear... but just get your responsibilities done early and save yourself the mental pressure of it hanging over your head. Don’t wait for the last day to write your paper or mow the lawn or whatever, just do it. Your mind will thank you for allowing it to be a bit more free. 

A very beneficial side effect to this is that you will also feel better about yourself. Being productive and responsible strengthens our internal image of ourself. But we already went over that!



**10 - Live in the moment.**

“If you’re living in the past, you are depressed.
If you’re living in the future, you are anxious. 
If you’re living in the present, you are at peace.”

Not a big one, just some meditation. Sometimes we get so caught up in our past or looking ahead that we forget to appreciate the moments that we’re currently in. 


**11 - Avoid political discussions.**

Here’s the truth: you may be right, or you may be wrong. But if you’re trying to look after your mental health, participating in political discourse will almost never benefit you. It’s very difficult to have healthy and productive conversations in this field and you will most likely end up causing your mental state to spiral back down. 

If you do engage, do your best to walk away from every interaction knowing you did the best that you possibly could. This means: be respectful; listen; validate, and don’t verbally (or physically) attack people. 

The goal is to be the best possible version of yourself in dialogue, this way you can walk out of an interaction knowing that you did you’re absolute best and there’s nothing to feel guilty for. If you make a mistake, ACCEPT that there is consequences, and use this as opportunity to do better. 

Admittingly for me today, this is the element that currently contributes most to my overwhelming sense of hopelessness in the world today. Every day I see things online or in the news that is upsetting or makes me sad, and I don’t even look for it. I try to avoid politics because I find it all so emotionally daunting, but so much of it is forced on you. 

I can only speak for myself here. I am easily depressed over this; the depression is for a lack of faith in my fellow humans. I want the world to be a unified place. I know that’s probably just an idealistic dream, but I see so many opportunities for people to come together and they don’t. They argue, and they don’t listen to each other. It’s not just ‘that’ that effects me, it’s the principle that people would even treat each other like that so unjustifiably to begin with, when things could be so different. This weights me down a lot today, and I’m still learning to grow here.

22,"Lost my youth to depression, having trouble accepting it and growing up now that I'm 30","I spent my teens and twenties depressed. I guess I'm still depressed but at least now I'm functional. For the past few years I've been able to function and more or less maintain the illusion of being a real person. The days where I struggled to get out of bed, the crippling anxiety, and the periods of agoraphobia seem to be gone for good. Now it's just feelings of emptiness and this sense of loss/regret that makes it hard to sleep at night. I just completely wasted my youth and wrecked my present/future in the process. 

I don't have friends. I've never had friends. I've talked to people online on and off for years, I can make small talk, and I can interact just fine in ""professional"" contexts. I just don't know how to form relationships with other people, how to be vulnerable and reveal my ""real"" self, how to be relaxed and enjoy myself around other people. Seeing people out having a good time with friends makes me really sad and uncomfortable because I just don't understand it at all.

I feel like I'm mentally trapped in adolescence and all I want to do is live my youth. I want to make friends, go to parties, go on road trips, learn how to date, etc. I know that all of these things are possible at my age but my peers are no longer in that stage of life. People are settling down, getting married, and having kids... or if they're not then they know what they like and how to do it. I don't even know how to get started.

I know I'm not supposed to compare myself with others but it's so hard. No matter what I'll do now I'll never have done anything interesting when I was young. I don't have any worthwhile memories, I don't have a dating history, I don't have any important formative experiences. There's just no getting around the fact that I'm not on the same level as my peers and that no matter what I do now I can't ever really ""catch up"" since the learning opportunities and experiences available to me now are just not the same. No amount of platitudes about how you're ""never too old for..."" will change the fact that, at some point, doors start closing. 

Half my thoughts and desires seem so immature for someone my age. I'm at a point where I should be getting serious about my career but I stay in a dead-end job because it pays enough for me to be comfortable and trying to be serious about career-related stuff feels exhausting. I went to a few networking events for the field I thought I wanted to break into and I just feel ridiculous when I try to talk like a grownup and pretend to give a shit. I don't want to think about things like that, I want to do all the fun, irresponsible things that normal people get out of their system by my age. But I keep being reminded that I'm 30 and that it's time to get serious about my career, retirement planning, etc.    

I try to maintain perspective and remind myself that it could be worse. I have a decent job and a comfortable life. I have a handful of (entirely solo) hobbies that I enjoy. I really like where I am on a completely superficial level - for the first time in my life I'm really satisfied with my home, my appearance, etc. I just feel like my life is always going to be sort of hollow and empty because I missed out on too much during the part of life where I was supposed to experience new things, make mistakes, and figure out who I am as a person.

How do I get over this and embrace life as a 30+ year old adult? How do I go about learning how to form relationships with other people and enjoy life in an age-appropriate way?

23,The worst mistake I've ever made regarding my mental illness,"...was believing *it* *was me*. Saying ""*This is who I am, an anxious person. I am anxiety and anxiety is me. This is just the way I am*.""

I struggled with anxiety and depression most of my youth. During college my social anxiety peaked into a debilitating illness, and I couldn't even go to classes or make small talk with my colleagues. My mother had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression, and this further cemented the idea that I was born to live like this. It was literally written in my genes, so it had to be forever.

Now that I've managed to cure most of it, I can see the huge mistake that I’ve made in believing that anxiety was a substantial part of my *identity*. As I see it now, anxiety is something I do, it’s a behaviour, it’s a bad algorithm that I'm running in the background, it’s a cluster of bad brain pathways that get strengthened every time they activate.

Changing that algorithm was insanely difficult and it took years. But something I learned is not to confuse hard with impossible. And to not be discouraged just because something is hard. I learned to erase certain ideas from my vocabulary, and one of them is “yeah, but that’s so hard”. If it’s possible, I’m giving it a try. Because life is too short to be spent in fear. And very few of the things we are afraid of actually matter.

Anxiety is just another voice in our heads. We have many voices constantly speaking to us. Some are kind, some are angry, some are encouraging and brave. At any given moment, we give a platform to one of those voices. And the more we listen to it, the stronger it becomes. If you let anxiety speak, it will scream. And then it will bring its friends: shame, self-hatred, hopelessness. And then we listen to those as well. And we feed them, we agree with them and we adopt them. And they become stronger. And then we wake up one day and realise we have no control over our inner world anymore. Because we never exercised it.

Stand guard at the door of your mind. Don’t let just anyone with a voice in. None of those who speak are inherently right. Every one of them is just a version, a perspective, just one lens through which you can see reality. None of them tells the whole story. Depression and anxiety have the deceitful power to convince us that what they show us is the real, unvarnished truth, that somehow they lifted a veil off our eyes, when in fact they are just another dirty glass showing us a distorted version of reality.

How we talk to ourselves and how we see ourselves in the mirror is a habit.

How we approach difficult times and uncertainty is a habit.

How we relate to other people and how much we allow them to treat us badly is a choice and a habit.

How much we attach ourselves to the wrong pursuits is a habit.

How much we care about image and external validation is a habit.

25,"Mid-30s, struggling to come to terms with how much of my life I wasted and trying to figure out how to start living after years of depression and anxiety","I'm a few months shy of turning 36. I had kind of a moderately abusive childhood and sort of shut down socially and emotionally around 14. It was nothing really horrifying but my parents were pretty damaged people and weren't really equipped to raise well-socialized, well-adjusted kids. I was always kind of encouraged to avoid other people and to avoid making friends because other kids might get me into drugs or lead me away from their religion (as if I needed friends for either, lol). They mellowed out a bit as I got older but I was pretty much a wreck by my early adult years. I completely wasted my youth and I still haven't had a single friend.

I spent my 20s basically hiding from the world, then freaked out about approaching 30 and rushed to get my shit together. I ended up managing to start a pretty decent career in my early 30s by a combination of working my ass off and getting really, really lucky. Learning the social skills required to maintain a professional office job was incredibly stressful and I'm not sure how I did it. I basically spent my early 30s learning things that most people learn in high school or college and it was awkward and difficult as hell. I didn't really have any social energy left to do anything outside of work and then the pandemic hit right as I was starting to feel a little bit secure in my social skills and my ability to maintain my new career.

I moved to a new city a few months ago, which has been a dream of mine ever since my early 20s but I just never had the mental or financial resources to do it. I think on some level I thought that if I could just pull this off that I'd be able to make up for lost time but I'm realizing that doing this at 35 is a lot different than doing it at 18-25 would have been. I honestly thought I could sort of live out my youth a few years late and that everything would be fine but I'm having to face the fact that that time is gone and there's nothing I can do about it. I honestly just don't even know how to relax and have fun. I've been to a few bars with coworkers and being in those kind of environments for the first time scares the hell out of me. I always wanted to go to bars and clubs and parties and all that shit that young people do and now I realize that I don't have any idea how to relax or have fun around other people and that, even if I'm not too old for all of it already, I probably would be by the time I figured out how to enjoy it.

I feel like there are reminders of what I missed everywhere I turn. There are college students and recent grads everywhere, smiling and laughing with their friends. My building is FULL of exceptionally privileged young people. I can't believe I live in a place like this at 35 and it seems like a good chunk of the building is fresh out of college. There are always loud groups of them hanging out in the lobby, playing pool or whatever. I'm happy for them that they get to live their best life while they're young but at the same time it's like a punch in the gut every time I walk through the front door and get this very clear reminder of what I missed out on as I head to the elevator. 

I keep trying to make myself leave the house to get out and do things. There's a lot to do and see here and even a walk to some nearby landmarks or a trip to a museum or riding public transportation out to another neighborhood and exploring provides a much more interesting and novel experience than just about anything else I did in my adult life up to this point. It can be kind of overwhelming sometimes and seeing couples and groups of friends out doing things makes me really sad. It's hard to avoid self-pity spirals and sometimes I can't help but shut down and avoid leaving the house for a week or so because it just feels overwhelming.

Another thing that has been haunting me is that I'm just now realizing just how long a day/week/month/etc can be. If I make myself get out of bed before noon on a day off and set a schedule of things I want to accomplish I find myself SHOCKED at how much I can fit in a day, and just how LONG it seems at the end of it. I think back to things that happened a week or two ago and can't believe it's been such a short time since those things happened since it feels like ages ago. The months that I've been here feel longer than the previous several years combined. I'm amazed and horrified of how much of my life I just treated as disposable and how it just all ran together and seemed to pass in the blink of an eye. I remember times in my early 20s when I was unemployed and didn't leave the house and a few months seemed like a few days at times. Now I look back to September and it doesn't even feel like it was in the same year.

Right now I'm locked in this cycle where I go out, try to do things, get overwhelmed at how much there is to experience and how much time I've wasted, end up hiding inside for a week and feeling guilty as hell for wasting even MORE time after I should have known better, and then forcing myself to go out and do more shit. I haven't even really attempted to do anything social yet. I had all these grand plans of volunteering, taking classes, and starting all these hobbies but I see all these people out socializing and can't stop thinking that I'm never going to be able to be one of them and I might as well save myself the pain of trying to fake it and embarrassing myself. I know that's wrong, and that I need to put myself out there, but I just haven't managed to convince myself to do it yet.

I feel completely lost. I don't know what I'm supposed to want at this point, or what's even still possible. The idea of going and meeting people and being friends with them seems completely impossible. I don't know how I'm supposed to relate to people when I haven't had any of the same social experiences as them. Every time I'm in a situation where there's a potential for casual conversation with another person I feel like I'm from another planet or something. There are so many unwritten rules and things that people seem to do or say without really thinking, as if it's second nature, and I don't know how I'm supposed to learn all of that if I haven't already. 

I'm trying to be grateful for what I have. I good job and a nice apartment in a big coastal city in the US. I'm doing better than my parents were and their parents were at my age and I think it's pretty remarkable that I have something like this after years and years of depression and anxiety. I just can't really wrap my mind around how much time I've wasted and continue to waste and it feels like it's getting to be too late to turn things around.

26,“You’re depressed because you have depression.”,"This is the most important phrase I ever heard. It honestly is what kicked me into high gear about my mental health. 

I used to list the hundreds of negatives in my life and think if I solved them all, I would cure my depression. 

If only my job was better. If my dad never drank. If I had my degree. If my sister wasn’t abusive. If my boyfriend was here. If someone loved me. If I had my own apartment. If I was prettier. If I was smarter.

The reality was that these issues were separate from my depression. My depression was a medical issue; it had little to do with the events in my life. Yes those events and circumstances sucked and might have made it worse, but I’d still have a medical condition. 

Understanding my depression and fighting it had to do with me. I couldn’t control what anyone else did, but I could control getting help and fighting it. 

Remember that the actions of others almost never have anything to do with you. What they say. What they do. That’s them and their problems. They may affect us, they may say they wouldn’t do or say those things if you were/weren’t a certain way, but that’s not true. People say mean things because of their problems. People do mean things because of their problems. People come and go because of them and their problems.

27,I decided not to kill myself last night. Or ever.,"Today I am celebrating the fact that I have decided to live the rest of my life (disclaimer: this is not including euthanasia for incurable medical maladies). 

Wanting to live is a very foreign feeling for me. I think normal people make the decision to die, right? As in, they go from ""living"" to ""I don't want to live anymore, so I'm going to kill myself."" 

For me, it's the opposite; I am going from ""not living"" to ""I don't want to kill myself anymore, I want to live."" That might not make any sense to anyone else, but I feel like I've had a massive breakthrough.

I felt like I had a clock ticking away inside of me for the past decade or so, and when the time was right, I would off myself. 2013 was a very grim year for me (I honestly don't remember most of it, and not from blacking out with drugs/alcohol, though they were involved occasionally), and I really thought the time was coming. I could see no way up or out, and I didn't care. I just wanted everything to be over and for me to disappear. I was planning methods and last words and everything.

Last night as I was seriously mulling over last words, etc, and I don't know how, but somehow the thought popped into my head: what if they weren't my last words? ...what if I didn't kill myself, ever? Maybe I could make this work? I probably wouldn't enjoy it, but hey it wasn't so bad, right? It was like a lightbulb slowly glowing brighter and brighter. This is getting long already, so I won't go into too many details, but now, it's like giving up my attachment to life or death has allowed me to *want* to stick this ""life"" thing out. I don't know what's coming or if I'll enjoy it, but for the first time in a VERY VERY long time, there is actually an inkling of curiosity in me when I think about the future rather than a dark abyss of dread.

I am still having major issues with anxiety and depression, but I might as well see what there is to come, even if it sucks. Hopefully it won't, but whatever, even if it does, there's not much point. :)

This post was more for my own cathartic purposes than anything else, but if anyone wants to chime in I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks guys, and happy Friday.

(original post in /r/depression got removed)","Ok, I'll try to make this as short as possible, it still won't be particularly short though. Also, please excuse my english.

What helped me the most? Put very briefly:

[Will smith on sucess in life.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhIom0rc0dk) - you don't even have to read anymore, just listen

**STEP ONE: I found some of  THE BEST AUDIO AND VIDEO THAT IS FUCKING FREE ALL OVER THE INTERNET concerning not only depression but any problem a human being can have.**

**STEP TWO: I PUT THAT SHIT ON MY PHONE AND PC...**

**STEP THREE: I LISTEN TO THAT SHIT WHEN DOING ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE MY 100% ATTENTION ALL THE TIME (i.e. when 
playing video games, walking, shopping, running, working out at work, cleaning, waiting at bus stop/doc's office, in a bus,**

**- at this point, I'm absorbing the exact information I need the most every day, WITH BARELLY ANY EFFORT AT ALL**

**STEP FOUR: PROFIT**

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**The structure:** 

-First I will make a list of everything that has been proven to relieve depression and increase happiness.

-Then I will make short points and explanations for things from the list.

-And then I will post variety of sources supporting all my claims so that you can't bullshit yourself from atleast recognizing the possibilities (the way I used to).
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Basics, what has been scientifically proven to work best:

Available for anyone:

**1) Physical exercise**

**2) Meditation**

**3) Focusing on the positive (much more complex but also way more effective than it sounds)**

**4) Positively alter your surroundings**

**5) Exercise a signature strength**

**6) Do the shit you know you should do but don't wanna do**

**7) Extremely simple and brief brain exercises (explained below)**

Available for anyone, usually demanding more willpower:

**7) Act of kindness, helping other people, vulunteering, using money on others instead of oneself (huge effects, not only on aleviating depression but also eliminating negative more stress, making you feel like you have MORE time any many other benefits)**

Available only for some: 

**8) Any kind of positive social contact (family, friends, social groups, therapeutists, strangers)**
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Explanations:**

**PHYSICAL EXERCISE** - Any kind, any form, naturally the more, the better, the more intense, the better. It has been proven that even 30 minutes a week of moderately intense exercise can make noticeable difference.

Scientific evidence for exercise to combat depression? Over 9000. I can't guarrantee you that you will start exercising, **however I CAN guarrantee you that if you do, you WILL feel better.
**

**Regular physical exercise has been proven MORE EFFECTIVE at combating depression than any antidepressive medications.**


Examples:

1) Regular walks for 10-30 minutes

2) Running/jogging (start small, you will see considerable improvements very soon)

3) Weightlifting 

**(If you think running is not for you, you should know that humans are naturally *the  best long distance runners on the planet* and persistence running was one of our biggest evolutionary advantage in the struggle for survival.)**

**Why does exercise work?** We've been running around and fucking shit up for hundreds of thousands of years during our entire history and only in the last several decades (less than a blink from the evolutionary point of view) did our physical activity levels drop to the present level. 

**Our bodies and minds are hard-wired and work best when we fuck around all the time.**

**""It's not that exercising is an antidepressant, but rather that NOT EXERCISING IS A DEPRESSANT."" - Tal Ben-Shahar**

**How does it work?** Put very simply, physical exercise significantly lowers the exact neurochemicals in your body that make you lazy, unmotivated and depressed and increases the exact neurochemicals that make you feel happy, focused, energized and 
motivated.

My own experience, put very briefly:
 
-bought a hand strenghtener to fuck around with my hand when im sitting at the pc 

-started to do several half-assed push-ups every day

- during the summer holiday I started running (0.5-1 mile every day) even though for 19 years of my life **I was convinced that running just isn't for me** 

-began to feel better and run better everyday and built up to 18 miles within 3 months

-stopped running by the winter because it was too cold and I could'nt find the energy to run regularly after I started working

-got somewhat depressed by then

-knew I had to begin exercising again and do it consistently

-**knew I couldn't drag my ass to the gym, bought two dumbbells**, looked up internet for some exercises, now doing full upper body exercise every weekend **at home**, and it helps alot (I walk a lot and my legs get regular stress at work 5 times a week)

MEDITATION

Q: I know all that meditation stuff sounds good, but it can't actually change my brain, can it?

A: [Yes, it can.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_activity_and_meditation)

Q: What meditation should I do?

A: Mindfullness meditation (focusing on the breath will be the best for a begginner) 

Q: How should I meditate?

A: There are tons of simple meditation guides on the internet, just google it and pick the simplest. You may also visit /r/meditation.

Q: How does meditation help me?

A: It helps you to be more mindful of all your actions and thoughts, making it much more easier for you to notice them and change them for better, among many other things.

Q: How long or often should I meditate? 

A: Five minutes a day will do, you can increase it when you feel like it.

**Q: How do I know how much will meditation benefit me?**

**A: The worse you think you are at meditating, the more it will help you.**

**Q: When do I know I need to meditate the most.**

**A: At the point in your life, when you feel like you cannot find time or energy for meditation, that is when you need to meditate the most.**

Q: What pose should I have for meditation?

A: Any pose where you don't fall asleep yet feel comfortable.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**FOCUSING ON THE POSITIVE:**

- You CAN decide what you are thinking, and you CAN change your thoughts for the better. Yes, it doesn't seem to work in the begginning, but it gets much easier and natural over time.

- Yes, changing the way you think (i.e. thinking more positively) ACTUALLY DOES AFFTECT YOUR BRAIN STRUCTURE. (Sources within the link below.)

- Everytime you think negatively, your brain gets better at scanning for the negatives, everytime you think positively, your brain gets better at scanning for the positives.

- More positive thinking affects every area of your life, including your **energy levels**, social relationships, any kind of success and much more.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**POSITIVELY ALTER YOUR SURROUNDINGS:**

- Watch less TV, especially the news, because they might as well be called ""The bad news""

- Spend more time with people you like if possible, the best people are the ones with whom you can be yourself.

- Spend less time on the internet checking negative things like conspiracies, wars, world fuck ups and such - you don't have to be blind as to what the world really, just don't emerge yourself fully into just one side of the story.

- I'm lazy, but you surely can think of thousands of more way to positively alter your surroundings.

**5) Exercise a signature strength**

- Doing a little of anything that you know you are good at every day noticeably increases your happiness levels. 

[List of signature stregths here.](http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/aiesec/content.aspx?id=821)
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**DO THE SHIT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD DO BUT DON'T WANNA DO**

- Everytime you use your willpower to do anything you wouldn't normally do, your willpower increases slightly for ANY other tasks you need to do.
(this can mean anything, from visiting the dentist, exercising, studying for exams to just doing your laundry or even picking that shit from the ground and putting it in the trash can in your house - if you're the same lazy fuck I used to be)

- Counterintuitively, after only few weeks, YOUR LIFE GETS EASIER when you learn to do what you should be doing, because AVOIDING TASKS TAKES MORE ENERGY than actually doing them and over time DOING THOSE TASKS FEELS EASIER THAN NOT DOING THEM.

- Everytime you use you willpower, you get a little happier and more confident

29,A few generic tips that everyone can use to make their life a bit more tolerable.,"Hi everyone! I'm a 23 (almost 24-year-old) guy who has been extremely depressed for the past four years. I've felt a sense of emptiness since I was 14 (10 years ago when my elder brother left home and I started getting addicted to porn), but I've only been depressed since I was about 19-20ish. I'm not going to get into my journey, but instead, write the key things that I think every depressed person should realize to get better. I'm by no means fine, but I hope this post gives someone something to think about and maybe someone can help me get better too.

&#x200B;

1. **One solution doesn't fit all**. You need to internalize and truly believe the things you are doing to get better. If you just follow what someone else says without believing it at all, it's unlikely that it'll help you. 
2. **There are many paths to getting better**. Don't overcomplicate things and try out a million things at once. Believe in a path and follow it. Don't get distracted by the next shiny/exciting advice you find. Getting better is a process that takes time. You need to invest time into doing a particular set of things instead of doing 30 different things half heartedly.
3. **Talking to a professional/taking medication** isn't a sign of weakness. Getting over depression isn't a simple journey for everyone. It's okay to seek help.
4. **Your current routine is your biggest enemy.** Things like your phone, the people you hang out with, the drugs you take, the addictions you have are the reason why it's tough to break out of this state of mind and do things you are happy about. Putting it bluntly, the only things that matter are your health, career, and family. Watching your favorite podcast isn't essential to living life. Spending time on Reddit isn't an essential part of life. Unwinding and playing video games over the weekend isn't essential. Unwinding and doing drugs isn't essential. Once you have this clarity, truly look at the things that have a bad influence on your life and cut them down one by one. Your life should be filled with things that you are proud of. You should never look back over the past 3 years and be sad that you spent every weekend playing video games. 
5. **Moderation is key, but don't make your life too complicated by trying to be moderate in everything**. I often hear the argument that video games aren't actually bad. They help people de-stress. This is amazing advice for the person who is tired after a 45-hour workweek and plays Breath of the wild for half an hour on a Friday evening. We are fucking depressed and playing video games every day because we are too afraid to deal with life. We are not ""normal"". Don't try to unnecessarily complicate life by trying to be the ideal person when you are getting better. It's okay to keep yourself away from distractions completely on this quest to get better. 
6. **Forgive yourself** when you mess up. You will mess up numerous times, but as long as you have a sound backing as to what you are doing, you will eventually get there. You will continue to have rough times, but you need to bounce back and keep moving forward. 
7. **KISS (Keep it simple, stupid).** This is a repeat of the previous points, but it's really important. When you change your routine in a bid to get better, don't make it too hard to follow. Have a few atomic things you want to do so even if you aren't able to achieve 2 out of 4 things to begin the day, you can at least do the other 2 things since they aren't dependent on the previous 2 things. Don't unnecessarily complicate your life by aiming too high, to begin with. Do a bunch of simple things to start gaining momentum.
8. **This exact same world will look amazing when you are not depressed**. I am a firm believer that the world is amazing. Yes, there are sad times and there are happy times, but that doesn't make the world less amazing. When you get over depression, your surroundings don't change, it's your response to your surroundings that changes. You can become the person you want to be.
9. **Don't let others drag you down.** In American, the left and right-wing people are both good at doing this. Left-wing people make you feel like everyone is getting screwed over by the rich and no matter what you do, you lose which I feel is the worst mindset to have especially for someone depressed. Right-wing people make it sound like everyone who doesn't agree with them is out to get them and is idiotic for thinking the way they do. In India as well, people make it seem like if you walk out and complain about the government you will be put in jail when the reality is very different for 95% of the people. Don't let the negativity of those around you affect you. It's okay to be selfish and happy when you are getting out of depression.
10. **Get off social media/reddit.** These platforms make you lose your critical thinking since you keep getting fed information. Primarily use the internet for things you specifically are looking for. If you are reading too many comments on an askreddit post, you are probably doing something wrong. Chill out, spend some time outside the internet. Life doesn't always need to be lived at 100 miles an hour.",1613312994.0
30,"Theme of the month, get over your hardships by FACING them...”The only way out is through!”","This last month has been hard on my anxiety at first. I ran into a terribly awkward situation at work where I got into a snappy argument with a coworker who is also a close friend but now boss as well. I messaged him asking to discuss it a couple days later, and HE avoided me about it for days until we had to work together again. He said it was nothing and he’d already forgotten about it, but then why was he being avoidant himself? Lol. Anyways, I cleaned up my side of the street. Said what I needed to and felt my job security again and all was better just by TALKING. 

In the next situation for the last 3 weeks I have been getting passed over to do a skill at work that I just got certified in and learned. I was really enjoying creating a pool of experience before this 3 weeks and could see myself struggling more when I was assigned the task. I just bitched to my close friends about it at first, who then gave me an actual PLAN. They told me I NEEDED to talk to the boss and soon, and then how to approach it with his specific mindset. Luckily, most of my friends just happen to be older and more mature than I. Well I didn’t want to do it, I was nervous about ever approaching a boss, but the issue was bothering me so much that I bit the bullet and texted for a meeting. We had the meeting the next morning and it actually went BETTER than I could have even planned and the boss is going to give me what I want which is to focus on my new skill set to fine tune it!

Lastly, a newer best friend started dating a recent ex with whom I’m also close friends with still. It ate me up for days until I talked to a girlfriend who told me the same and then saw my therapist who also said to TALK to her in person, tell her how I’m really feeling and what any concerns are. Well I texted her today, and we had an amazing and productive and all around relieving dinner tonight. 

So I guess what I’m saying is, I’m seeing the theme here and learning the lesson. That when something socially, even with work, is bothering me, that the best approach is TO APPROACH. To sit down and have the “tough adult conversations.” Which with me being a very extroverted person and natural talker turn out not to be nearly as bad as the nights of lost sleep. I hope this approach will help some of you too! 

If something with someone is bothering you, stopppp keeping it bottled up and FACE IT! ",1544676107.0
31,Pleasing others creates false friendships,"I'm learning to give myself more value. And worry less of others. I'm really trying to not feel like I need to earn a friendship somehow.

I'm learning to walk away. To ghost plans and not answer. //Edit here: not ghosting as I now learned what the word means. But cancel or reschedule.

I'm learning to initiate friendships and see where it goes without feeling overly responsible and like ""they have to love me SO much and I'll give my everything to get maximum amount of validation"". I'm learning not to forcibly continue old friendships. I'm letting myself have phases and not worry too much if it's obvious or if it makes people judge me. I just need to find myself so I need to try stuff out. It's  okay. 

It's coming slowly but they are all things I wasn't able to do earlier. Super happy about the progress towards one day loving myself.",1543947449.0
32,A small tip for people getting better. Be selfish about your happiness.,"Preface by saying that this is just my personal opinion.

I was always concerned about how my actions affected other people. Always trying to change myself for other people. Always worried about how other people would perceive things. I never could never be true to myself if I was always so malleable to my surroundings. I knew that I was never a dick to people, but I was grew overly concerned by everyone's feelings and whatnot. I think that this really prevented me from seeing the big picture. It takes some effort, but now I am more selfish about my happiness than before. I put my happiness before others. The best part is that once I became happier, I was more confident in helping those around me. I become selfish to become less selfish in a weird sort of way.

I am in no way mentally well. Like 60% of the time I feel horrible. But I was able to get over a extremely tough situation recently which questioned my self worth, and I was able to get over it in about 15 minutes while a couple of months ago I would probably be affected by it for weeks together.

33,Tips to Deal with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,"For context I'm a 25F in a highly developed city on the west coast. I'm currently in a serious relationship but been single for long periods of time and dealt with failed relationships after years of commitment. I grew up in a conservative religious home with neither parents active in the household since the age of 8. I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 10-15 years give or take. Here is just a short list of tips and tricks that help me claw myself out of an unannounced spiraling depression episode. Obviously everyone is different but I hope this can help at least one person not sink further into the depression pit. It has taken me years of introspective thought and practicing different behaviors to the point where I think I recognize my triggers and I feel I have some sort of handle on it now to where I can cope. I hope everyone on here gets the help they need and realize that there is hope if you're willing to fight for yourself. I know this post is going to be unbearably long at some parts but I think it's important for me to explain what I do and why I do it so you can hopefully apply it to your lives.

1. **Keep a journal:** As trivial and silly as it sounds, keeping a journal to unleash all my uninhibited thoughts and feelings helped me immensely throughout my adolescence and adulthood. I had always been the person hesitant to confide in a non-professional (family, friend, coworker etc) to avoid judgement, unsolicited advice, fake sympathy and I feel a lot of people feel the same way. The first big step I took for my depression is writing down a 7 page account of events that I believe lead to a perpetual state of depression. Getting all that information out of my head gave me a huge sense of relief. I never knew I was holding onto so much weight and animosity toward a situation or a specific person until it fell out of me like an emotional waterfall.
2. **Cut out toxic relationships/friendships:** This was probably one of the hardest steps in my journey and one I heard on a constant basis from countless articles. It's a lot easier said than done but I can wholeheartedly say cutting out specific people in my life that brought nothing but a dissatisfaction has drastically improved my state of being. Sometimes it's hard to tell when someone needs to be cut out but I had to ask myself if I'm spending time with this person because I was lonely and bored, or if they genuinely brought me joy and fulfillment. That can be a hard distinction to make but for me it was a gut feeling once I actually thought about it deeper.
3. **Get a pet/plant:** I know this isn't a feasible option for everyone on here but having a furry friend gave me a ""purpose"" and a ""reason"" to get out of bed everyday. If I want to sleep in or pretend I don't exist my cats wont let me because they want to play, give me love and cuddles and I have to make sure their food and water is full. It forces me to get out of bed every morning whether I want to or not. I know dogs and cats may not be doable in every living situation but even something as small as a hamster or fish will force you to stick to a routine, distract you and bring you more joy. This also applies to a plant, which is a more practical option for a majority of people, especially if you don't have the kind of money to take care of an animal.
4. **Recognize your signs:** What I mean by that is recognize what behavior patterns you fall into that lead you to spiral into a depression episode. A common one for me (and a lot of other people on here) is not taking care of myself such as, oversleeping, not eating for days, not showering, not responding to loved ones for days, cancelling plans, calling sick into work etc. Once I recognized these sequence of behaviors were a result of me not keeping myself in check, I was able to counteract them with other behaviors, which has been one of the hardest things I've had to learn... Which leads me to #5.
5. **Changing toxic behavior:** Believe me, I know how easy it is to sink deeper and deeper into the pit. I'm sure for some of you (like for me) the pit is comfortable at this point and getting yourself sounds more scary and daunting than letting yourself go. Circling back to #3 I have found ways to *forcing* myself to do things besides lay in bed and pretending to not exist. I now set a routine for myself after work on Monday I meal prep for the entire rest of the week. One, it forces me to do something after work that's out in public (grocery shopping), two, it forces me to do something around the house besides laying around and three, over the years I've actually grown to have fun doing it. I throw on a funny TV show, watch YouTube, listen to audio books or listen to music. That's just one example of something practical and that most everyone can do to force yourself to stay productive. You will spend less money on food as well instead of eating out all the time, and I have a harder time justifying skipping 2-3 days of food to avoid my food from spoiling (I'm a penny pincher).
6. **Having something to look forward to:** A reoccurring theme to me is to keep busy and productive so I don't feel so stagnant and idle. For me I try to constantly have at least 1-3 things planned at any given month (preferably more than 1-3). Of course think of things that YOU are interested in but some examples of things I do are: concerts, local attractions in your area (my area has a zoo, small theme park, farmers markets), camping, conventions, trying now restaurants etc.
7. **Bad days will happen:** When all of this is said and done, I still have those bad days/weeks. It's just important to realize that they wont last forever, if you're willing to fight fucking hard for better days. It's okay to cry, it's okay to take a break and ""grieve"" so to speak. Circumstances and situations can definitely trigger bad days/weeks, but reverting back to #4 and #5 you need to recognize if it's just a bad day/week or something more.
8. **Self-love/Self-care:** If any of you are like me this is a tough one, especially if that little voice in your head tells you you're not good enough. After telling yourself that enough times over several years it's hard to convince yourself otherwise. I guess the most important part about this is baby steps so it eventually becomes second nature. Instead of just getting out of bed lifeless and putting on the first thing you see, pick out an outfit that gives you full confidence. Instead of running out the door without doing your hair or makeup, take that extra 10 minutes to build that confidence. Instead of coming straight home after work, treat yourself to a scenic drive or your favorite soft drink at the drive thru. Instead of comparing yourself to other's accomplishments, recognize your own and CELEBRATE them. There is NOTHING wrong with being happy with an accomplishment and celebrating it.
9. **Perspective:** My best friend struggles with insecurity, anxiety and comparing herself to others around her (as I do and have in the past) and hearing her accounts made me realize that what she was insecure and anxious about were things I had no idea about. I never focused on her physical appearance, I was always proud of her work ethic, her sense of humor, her tenacity etc. but all she saw was failure. It made me realize that the people that care most about you don't see those ""flaws"" that keep you up at night.

Another side of **Perspective:** This may not apply to everyone, but I'd say a majority of people were taught a certain standard of living to be deemed ""acceptable"". Whether that was by their parents, religious affiliation, school, social groups etc. With an ideal ingrained in your subconscious in your development years, it can be hard to shake even if you grow up and choose not to take that path. For example: Growing up in a large, religiously affiliated family I always believed that I would graduate high school, meet a husband and start a family together. Once I reached adolescence I realized that wasn't the choice I wanted to make with my life. For years I dealt with self-loathing and pain, thinking I wasn't choosing the right path even though staying with the faith isn't what I truly wanted. These pre-conceived ideas of success and happiness I was taught at such a young age wasn't success and happiness to me anymore, and that terrified me but I didn't even know it. I had to completely rearrange what happiness meant to me instead of relying on other people around me to define it on my behalf. I had to convince myself that my tattoos and piercings were okay. That drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis is okay in moderation and totally normal. After years of self loathing and self harm I convinced myself that being openly sexual with my partners is biologically normal and acceptable if done with the right intent and people. A lot of these revelations I learned through journaling.

I could write dozens of more things that have helped me throughout my 10-15 year journey. I can honestly say (fingers crossed) that every year that I work on myself the happier I am and the less episodes I slip into. I know this post is long enough but everyone on here has to know that none of this is easy. You have to fight for yourself and work on these things every day for long lasting results. You do deserve happiness even if you and everyone around you is telling you otherwise. ♥

36,I stopped insulting myself and now I can actually function better,"I’ve known about motivational “no negative self talk” things for a long time now, but mostly ignored them. (I used to have a really negative attitude towards “positivity” things because I always felt like they were mocking me.)

However, I actually don’t think I knew how to implement it.

I’ve been more self aware of my own thinking recently. And I wanted to try something out.

Every time I tried to insult myself in my mind, or said something negative, I would either gently tell myself to stop, or I would add a neutral or positive thought at the end.

IE if I drop a mug and break it, my immediate thought might be “Oh fuck! Well, I’m a dumbass,” would be replaced with “Oh fuck! Well I’m a dumbass—wait, don’t insult yourself.” Or I could replace it with “Oh fuck, well, now I have to clean this up.”

And I just practice on every small thing. From accidentally staying up too late or forgetting to eat to being afraid I’ll fail. I haven’t tried this out for a long enough time to see any dramatic changes, but recently I’ve noticed my mood’s been better and that I can handle things better.

That’s not all.

Sometimes I’m say, sitting in one space and I’m having trouble getting up. Normally I would yell at myself, “Get up! Why aren’t you getting up? Fine. I guess I’m stuck here.” But I realize that if I just nicely tell myself to get up, I actually do it almost immediately.

On days when my self-esteem is high (I.e. when I feel like I’m fine the way I am and there’s nothing wrong with me), I feel very friendly, warm, and interested in other people. 

On bad self-esteem days, however, it’s like I become a narcissist and other people in my life are like cardboard cutouts to me. Conversations become tedious games in which I must come up with “good” responses. I literally don’t care what other people are saying when it’s their turn to talk and I think about my own problems the entire time. ",1522801134.0
38,How to love yourself. A message I wish I could send my younger self.,"I'm writing this because I struggled with loving myself and could have used a post like this. This is how I generate loving feelings for myself.


This is a trick I've learned from meditation. I sit down and focus on my breathing for a bit, and then I ask: ""What is it that's keeping me from feeling full of love right now?""


If don't feel like I'm loving myself/loved by myself right now, I'm either not giving or not receiving my own love, logically speaking. Why would I deprive myself of feeling loved for even a second more? All the chemicals are sitting right there in my brain, but they're not being released.


So, then I focus on my love for other things. I like to mentally list all the things I love and am grateful for. I think, ""May all beings in the in the universe be at peace"" and visualize all beings being at peace. Throw in some meditating elephants if you want. Have fun with it.


When I do this, I can feel a very subtle feeling arise - love. The chemicals are being released, you know? Because I really do love the things I'm thinking about, a loving feeling shows up. Then I focus on the feeling. I visualizing the feeling as if it's radiating out of my heart in all directions, eventually growing to encompass the entire universe - as if everything is in a bubble of my love.


Then, I make a choice to give myself love. I think, ""I choose to love myself. I surrender to my own love. I love myself for being a loving person and the love I feel because of it. I love myself for being the person I am after all the stuff I've been through, and I love that I love myself.""


Sometimes I go through the senses and think about how much I love experiences like sight and hearing, knowing I won't always have them. I try to find gratitude for all the things I can, even for shelter, food, heartbeats, and breath.


Last, but not least, I make the choice to receive my own love. I try to allow myself to be loved by myself. It makes perfect sense for a person to love themselves and it would certainly end by feeling full of love. That sounds like as good of a time as I can possibly have right now (even if it's not exactly joy, but in all probability ""less-shitty.""). 


You can see I also try to convince myself of loving myself and allowing my own love through logic. That's because I have to logically deduce that loving myself is a good idea before I can begin to feel love for myself. It seems like unnecessary extra step to someone trying to be logical, yet I'm not doing the logical thing of loving myself automatically. The fact that I need any step at all just means I don't feel like I'm loving myself all the time. But even if there is a weird extra step or two I need to take mentally to allow myself to feel my emotional state turn to ""loving,"" why would I not take those steps? 


That issue may be a bit specific to me, but the larger picture is: there's a way to allow yourself to love yourself. Try picturing this whole situation as a puzzle. The finished picture: feeling full of love, compassion, and gratitude for myself. What pieces do I need to put together to make that finished picture happen? Why wouldn't I be loving myself already? Am I not giving love or just not allowing the love I give to change my emotional state? Why would I do that? Do I feel like I deserve love? Can I forgive myself for being imperfect, even just for 5 minutes to see how it feels? 


What if, for just 5 minutes, as an experiment for science, I sat here thinking about all the love I feel for everything in the universe, forgave myself for all my imperfections, felt gratitude for everything I have, filled myself with loving feelings, then loved myself simply for being full of loving feelings?


Then, I sit there and do it. Even if it's not perfect, it's not going to make my day worse. It almost always ends with me feeling full of love. The experiment may not have the same results when applied to a different brain, but it may point the way to a more loving mental state even if it doesn't work fully.


I hope none of this was too ""now draw the rest of the owl."" It helps me and I hope it helps you too.",1618958949.0
39,"If your happiness depends on someone or something happening, you're setting yourself up for suffering. Nothing is guaranteed, so let go of your ""if onlys"" and build your happiness in the here and now","If you think about what you need to be happy, you might think about achieving something in your career, or a relationship, or something you own. All of these things have something in common - they're conditions for happiness. As human beings we naturally get attached to goals and the status quo.

The bad news is that not everything in our career goes as we would like, relationships can end, possessions break and are lost. The good news is that you can enjoy what you have right now and be happy, even if the only thing that you possess is the ability to breathe in and out. 

By letting go of our attachment to things that we believe we need to be happy we can actually live calmer, happier lives. Of course its great to enjoy the things we own, the people we love and our work - but accepting that life will change and that we don't need external conditions for happiness reduces the suffering we feel when things don't go as we hope.

But I didnt. There was some kind of an event going on. A dog came to say hi to me. And the sunrise looked amazing.

41,"Yesterday, I made an Instagram post that I was feeling suicidal, and I'm so glad I did.","I post regularly on my Instagram, and I often make posts about my journey of overcoming my severe depression and anxiety. Recently, my mental health has been worsening for a few months, and I've sometimes felt lost, hopeless, and uncontrollable. I've been feeling so overwhelmed and tired.

Yesterday, I made a post on Instagram that explained that I was feeling suicidal, that I've always wondered what people would say at my funeral, and how this was my plea for help.

Within twelve hours, I had dozens of people messaging, calling, trying to meet me in person. As a former military kid, I had traveled all over the world. My middle school friends, former coworkers, closest friends, high school classmates I barely talked to, online acquaintances, neighbors, people I met once in real life... so many people reached out to me. Most of them wrote paragraphs to tell me how much they loved me, how they still think about me even if we hadn't talked for months or years.

And for the first time in so long, I feel so loved. I live in a college apartment complex and I am friends with many of my neighbors, and we all gathered safely in my friend's apartment downstairs and shared stories and I felt like I belonged for the first time in a while.

I feel really honored to have met so many amazing people who were willing to reach out to me when I said I needed extra support. I'm so glad that I was alive to hear people tell me they love me, even if it was online or over the phone, instead of those words being spoken at my funeral. 

Yesterday helped me realize how loved I am. While it was nice that so many people reached out, the most touching moments were when my closest loved ones reached out to me. I really needed to hear words of affirmation from them, but I never had any idea how to ask.

I think it's okay to ask for help. I think it's okay to say that you need some extra love and support. I'm really glad I did, and I feel like I can go on another day, and maybe even a few more. I'm really thankful.",1613532221.0
42,I nearly died and I'm still not over it,"February 2020 i was infected by Covid-19. A few hospital visits for abdominal pain passed. I finally went back to the ER. I had never been admitted to a hospital before this. I remember going to the ER, my fiance there, and a kind nurse put an iv in my arm. She said she was going to give me something for the pain. Thats about all I remember.

 Aparently, I quickly got shipped out to a larger hospital. They were confused by my condition. My heart, liver, and pancreas all shut down. I was circling the drain. I was placed under a medically induced coma so I would stop feeling the pain. This hospital shipped me off (on a plane!) To the Cleveland Clinic. They saved my life. 

I woke up mid March and was so confused. Also still in pain. I couldn't move, and the helplessness terrified me. I was left with permanent damage to my heart, really intense gastroparesis, IBS, nerve damage, enough gallstones to require gallbladder removal. 

Now I am still in recovery. My physical condition is not very good. I mean, I am getting better, but at a snail's pace. My heart will never be the same.. I really hoped to be done recovering and bounce back into my life with no problem, but thats not going to happen. While this is giving me depression and anxiety, what bothers me most is what happened while I was in a coma.

I have memories that aren't real. Its crippling how I cant accept that. I thought people were going to hurt me, I saw members of my family beside me who weren't there. Spaces of time that are not linear. Many different rooms, different conversations, and different events. Its scary, waking up and people telling you that none of these events happened. I had nightmares for months, panic attacks,, depressive episodes. I have since been diagnosed with PTSD. 

I am still very traumatized by what happened. This terrifying coma and the issues with my heart. Its a living nightmare. I feel like I was put under that first night, and was transported into a completely different life. There is definitely body disphoria there, as well. 

I am lonely, scared, depressed, and emotional. I really need someone who has gone through a near death experience like mine. None of my family or friends truly understand and I am perceived as lazy. I hate that. I dont know what my life is anymore. I just need someone to help me get over this.",1632517992.0
43,"After 6 chaotic and beyond difficult years, I just graduated college","I honestly did not think I could do it.

45,Getting over depression & the importance of basic habits,"*Disclaimer: I'm not a professional, this is my personal experience.*

In this bit I will write how basic habits have helped me get over burnout induced depression.

Some background: I'm 32 and I've been depressed at least once a year for as long as I remember. I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at 25 which makes me more susceptible to burnout and depression for a lot of reasons. I think one of my main struggles is that I have trouble understanding my emotions, which makes it difficult to not go over my own limits and to choose to do the things in my life that I find fulfilling. This means that I'm often overworked and/or overwhelmed while at the same time not feeling that I'm living my life. 

I'm currently in therapy for this (specifically psychoeducation & acceptance and commitment therapy) which helps a lot and I recommend it to everyone dealing with similar problems. However, in this post I will focus on what's helped me at least as much: basic habits.

**First habit: eating 3 times a day**

I've always been borderline underweight, but during my last episode I lost my appetite completely and it got pretty bad. I already had no mental energy, but now I had no physical energy either. 

The first thing I did to start to get over it was planning strictly 3 meals a day at set times. Instead of eating snacks at random times of the day whenever I realized that I needed to eat more (which I always realized too late anyway), now I didn't have to think about it. 

I used alarms and I forced myself to eat 3 at least somewhat regular sized meals at set times. My physical energy returned, and there were no more energy peaks and dips all day long because of the snacks. After less than a month of strictly following the schedule, my appetite returned. After less than 2 months it became a habit, and I find myself eating my meals before realizing it. It no longer takes any willpower, I just do it. And then I realized - *I've been going my whole life doing everything on willpower, I never had any habits*!

**Second habit: sleep**

Looking to make more habits, I realized that my daily schedule was a random mess. My sleep times were all over the place, sometimes sleeping 6 hours, sometimes 13, at random times during the night and sometimes day too. I did have somewhat regular work hours but because of the burnout I wasn't allowed to work (I'm fortunate to live in a country with decent labour laws). I desperately needed some structure in my day. 

I ended up on the polyphasic.net website learning about siesta sleep and other polyphasic patterns. I decided to start a siesta sleep schedule with 6h of night sleep plus a 1½h nap before lunch, to break up my day into two easier-to-manage chunks. This turned out to be a really good schedule for me, but daytime napping is not for everyone. 

Anyway, the most important thing I learned (and which applies to regular monophasic sleep as well) is that it is important to always sleep at the same times during the day. The stricter you are with sleep/wake times, the better quality sleep you will have. 

After 45 days of adaptation and being very strict with my times, this too has become a habit. Instead of laying in bed half awake for hours on end, I get out of bed within 5 minutes of my alarm. And when I go to bed, I no longer lay awake contemplating whatever for hours - I fall asleep within a few minutes.

**Third habit: going outside, exercise**

With my new strict sleep schedule, I now had to find something to do during the time I would normally lie in bed half awake. I decided to go on a 1h morning walk every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday right after I wake up, and to do a simple bodyweight exercise routine on Monday, Wednesday and Friday after waking up. By doing exercise or going on a walk literally 5 minutes after waking up, these were actually much easier habits to get into than I expected. Right after getting out bed, I'm not awake enough to make up bogus reasons not to do it. I've found that I really like early morning walks before most people are up, as well as the happy hormones that come after exercise. Sometimes when I have trouble getting myself out of bed, I tell myself I can either stay in bed and be miserable, or go for the walk and be miserable, but then at least I'd have done that and usually I feel better too. 

As an autistic person that lives mostly in his head, it's good to balance that out with some body exercise. I'm pretty happy with my body now - I feel like my getting stronger physically is tangible evidence that I'm getting over it. 

**Fourth habit: social contact**

With both my physical and mental energy slowly returning, and doing the basics out of habit instead of on willpower, I started to have some energy left for things that I find important in life. I make friends easily, but I have a lot of trouble staying in contact. Especially when I don't feel at my best, because I don't want to be a burden. Most of my friends have similar problems and aren't neurotypical either. So I started making it a habit: now every Monday evening I call my dad, Tuesday I call one friend, Wednesday afternoon I call or go on a walk with another friend, every Saturday night I have a zoom party. I feel less alone, I don't have to worry any more about whether it's a good time to contact, feel bad about not having talked for months, etc. 

**Fifth habit: meditation**

This is the habit I'm working on at the moment. I have some experience with meditation in the past, but I tend to not meditate at the exact moments I could use it most, so making it a habit seems like a good idea.

**How I learn habits**

It's difficult to learn habits, especially if the benefits aren't immediate or if a bad habit needs to be unlearned first. Things that have helped me:

* Reading the wiki at /r/theXeffect - most important things I learned is that it takes about 50 days to learn a new habit, setting SMART goals, and that keeping track of progress with daily Xs makes it progressively easier because the streak motivates you to continue. 
* Habit apps: I started using the (ad-)free app ""Goal Tracker"" by Intrasoft to keep track of progress, kind of similar to the charts at /r/theXeffect. It worked pretty well for me, but now use Habitica instead, in a small party where we keep each other motivated to do our habits and tasks. There are a lot of other apps out there that can help, I know my housemate for instance uses Tusk, Daylio and Routinery.
* Only doing one or two new habits at a time: too much new stuff and I'd just give up.
* Having a good reason to be strict: I know that these habits help me immensely with recovery, and it takes so much longer to learn habits when you don't take them seriously. I'd rather feel miserable but having done my habit, then just feeling miserable, and usually having done my habit makes me feel better & better about myself.
* Accountability: I have someone that I speak with every week and we go over how the habits have been going. The peer pressure from the Habitica app works well for me too.
* Specifically for sleep schedule: reading the basic info at polyphasic.net - e.g. sleep hygiene, dark period, the effect of meal time on sleep quality, how to manage sleep deprivation during the adaptation period.
* Specifically for exercise: picking the easiest routine to start with. As a beginner, I'm a big fan of the [minimalist bodyweight routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine) over at the /r/bodyweightfitness wiki. I will probably move on to a more advanced routine when I'm ready for that. I tell myself that I need to do at least 1 circuit, which is manageable even on quite bad days, but when I start I usually end up doing 20 minutes of exercise anyway. Same with the walks: I set the goal at 30 minutes on bad days, but once I'm out the door I almost always make it the full 1h walk.
* Specifically for meditation: the free guided meditation courses in the ad-free Medito app are great for beginners.

46,"I have major depressive disorder, survived a suicide attempt in my early 20s and last year put out my first stand up album. I've made it free on Bandcamp for World Mental Health day and talking self destructive brain crud is a big part of what I do.","Hi, I'm Zach Funk and I'm a Pittsburgh based comedian and storyteller. Like the title says I've been struggling with mental illness for about as long as I can remember. About nine years ago I started doing stand up comedy and storytelling and decided I wanted to make talking about depression/mental health an important part of what I do. There is so much stigma around openly discussing our issues that being able to get people to laugh about it can really help. I've found that if you can take something negative about your life and make something positive out of it that can also help others that helps with the internal struggle. It's like you own it it doesn't own you. Obviously as a comedian my goal has to be laughter but sometimes I've had audience members tell me that I've helped them better understand themselves, mental illness or someone they know who deals with it and that feeling of real human connection beats any laugh. 

Anyhow to celebrate today being World Mental Health Day I've made my album free/pay what you want on Bandcamp. The final three tracks are where the bulk of the mental health stuff is but it's sprinkled throughout the album. I know when I've been at my worst comedy has been a form of escapism for me - both as a fan and as a performer - so I'd like to share that today with anyone who's interested.

47,Dad died. No family left. Slowly drowning in bills and debt. Now I'm the sole provider for a household and I'm about to have a complete mental breakdown [29/M] (x-post from /r/Depression),"I really need some help.

Last year my Dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66. Zero warning. One minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.

He was my only family and I'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college. I'm one of those ""probably borderline autistic, zero social life"" kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his Dad told me I could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.  No rent, no bills, and I didn't feel like I was taking advantage of him because he'd been my sole rock for my whole life and I'd been his.  In every sense we were best friends, and of course I did anything I could around the house to help him out.

In an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me. The tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and I'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.

There are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them. My fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and I'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle I'm slowly losing every day.

I don't have any time for myself any more. I don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because I'm just at the end of my rope.

And above all else I miss my dad, every single day.

The one ""saving grace"" is that I also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch. And now I can't touch it until I'm 65 either, and I don't think I'll make it that far. I honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because I'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and I can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.

And I feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything. Some days I go to sleep and honestly hope I never wake up.

I hate this. I hate everything. I hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my Dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.

Every day of my life I want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet I have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and I will not be able to survive.

I need a break from all of this, but I can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.

I feel like a complete and utter waste of meat, like I should have a handle on these things at this point in my life but all of a sudden my happy world was yanked right out from under me and it's like I haven't seen the sun since., like I'm a pathetic non-human creature that doesn't even qualify as a man.

49,My anxiety and depression workout,"Over the past two months I've devoted my entire life to beating my anxiety, depression and sleep issues for good. I'm making some progress, so thought I'd share my strategy below. Partly in case it helps others and partly to keep myself motivated!


Background: To most people I'm an outgoing, sociable guy. But I've suffered from severe sleep issues and anxiety for the past 4/5 years. Any event out of my normal routine would send me into a bit of a tail spin. It could be drinks with friends, a presentation at work--anything. I'd been ignoring it for years and recently it all blew up in my face. A few stressful events at once = total meltdown. Depression took over me, I even started getting agoraphobic. I was signed off work for several weeks and that's when I realised I HAD to face this. 


Knowledge gathering: I devoted 2 weeks to understanding what I was going through and strategies to beating it. I talked to doctors, researchers in anxiety, eastern 'alternative' medicine practitioners and people who'd been through this and beaten it. Remarkably, there was a lot of consensus between them! Here's what I discovered:


- Prescription drugs (in my case 15 mg Mirtazipine) may help you in the short term, but they're not a solution (fairly obvious)

- Mindfulness is a long term solution. Practice meditation every single day for 30 minutes and you will slowly gain more control over your mind. DO NOT only practice it only when you feel bad. Treat it like going to the gym; you don't get biceps by pumping iron just before you go out. You've got to do it regularly, not just when you need it to see any improvement. Apparently in brain scans you can see parts of the brain which are associated with concentration and well-being become more active in someone who regularly practices meditation.

- Exercise can make a big difference-it can be as effective as anti-depressants. Try to exercise for 30 minutes a day

- Exposure therapy and acceptance therapy (ACT) in tandem work best. Slowly exposing yourself to challenges but also not battling your negative thoughts is a good strategy. Constantly being at war with your own thoughts heightens anxiety and can make things worse.

- Your diet can exacerbate problems. Keep a diary of when things feel worse incase some foods are causing bad reactions.


Phew! Still with me? 


Out of this I created my anxiety and depression beating workout. I called it a workout because it helps me understand it a little better/realise I need to be focused on it.


Step 1. I told my closest friends and family what I'm going through, I also told work. This was hard for me, I felt like dealing with it privately. But you know what? Dealing with it privately means no one knows why I might cancel and event or not turn up to work. That can costs friendships, jobs and more adding a massive amount more stress to the mix. You don't learn to sail in a storm.

Step 2. I started meditating every day. I bought two really helpful books on mindfulness-'Happiness' and 'Why Meditate' by Matthieu Ricard (read them in that order). I practice meditating for 30+ minutes a day, no excuses. Every time I don't feel like it, I give myself a good talking to (something of the sorts: you're currently unhappy. Everyone says this is the only way to beat it long term. So meditating is the most important thing in your life to do!). Now I'm a bit more confident I go to the local Buddhist centre twice a week. At first I could concentrate in meditation for about 5 seconds. Now I can concentrate it for 10 minutes. It's making a big difference already.

Step 3. I exercise everyday. Now, I'm a really lazy person. But I cancelled my train pass, got my bike fixed up and made a commitment to cycle to work, rain or shine. When I'm not cycling to work I go for a run. No matter how much I think I'll hate it, I always am glad I did the exercise.

Step 4. I cook from scratch most days. I cook big meals that I can freeze full of vegetables. I enjoy cooking, so this isn't so much of a problem for me but I appreciate some people might find this a huge chore.

Step 5. I use a magnesium oil spray before bed. This may be a placebo, but I've felt a big difference in my anxiety since adding this to my work out. Others seem to have found the same so it's worth a try.

Step 6. I made myself a timeline. Every week I do once small challenge. For example, the week before last it was return to work for a couple of days. Last week it was turn up to work for 4 days. This week, it's sticking at 4 days but also going to a random social event even if just for an hour. Small steps, but they're things I can tick off and see progress being made. And this is so so important to keeping motivated.

Step 7. Do one good, unexpected thing for someone every day. I found that I was getting very self-centered, understandably because I was going through hell. But I found that I was lamenting how self-centered I was becoming so I made this pact. So far it's just been things like hanging out with the homeless person down the road and helping him out, or smaller things like picking up a bit of litter on our street. Small things but important things nonetheless.

THE END. I hope I don't sound like I'm trying to be an expert-I'm far from it. I'm just sharing what's working for me so far. I've gone from not leaving the house to returning to work and doing a presentation. I've got a long, long way to go but man it feels good to be heading in the right direction after so many years.


I'd love to hear some other people's strategies and what's working for you!


Tl;dr: I created a strategy to beat my anxiety/depression and it's working so far.

_   Moved abroad 5 years ago to break out of my avoidant behaviour and wake myself up. Ended up living pretty much the same life. It doesn't feel real. I'm about to move back in with my parents, dropped out of uni a second time, made zero friends, left my dead end library job with nothing lined up, my one and only relationship ended after a year last March, neglected the friendships back in my hometown. I feel like I haven't grown in so long. It's terrifying to see how much life I let pass me by.  _

Never in my life I've felt as I have the past few months, every day the same. Sleep work ""eat"" and ruminate. Weekends a la Eleanor Oliphant but without the booze. Crushing, absolute loneliness. Anxious about how easily I wasted my time here. I feel entitled and pretentious, a spoiled child pounding his feet, crying to please let him start again, I didn't mean to live like this, I got it so wrong.

I have nothing but my scared self to blame. I had a good childhood, liked school and did well, I was quiet and introverted but got on with people and had friends. Never experienced anything traumatic. I wasn't anxious but teenage insecurities slowly shut me off. Fear of failure, the need to feel better than and do things all by myself. Low self esteem and people pleasing traits. Couldn't bring myself to pursue romantic relationships, too proud to ask friends for advice, passed on chances for being ""picky"" and afraid. Felt inadequate and stopped growing friendships, jumped around groups of acquaintances to avoid being lonely but kept people at arm's length. 

In high school I quite suddenly started feeling less sharp, focused and driven, apathetic, like I was not fully awake or present, and things weren't really happening. I stopped trying to get what I wanted, pretended I didn't really care. By not admitting I had issues like everyone else, I didn't allow myself to work on them and grow. Now years have gone by, life happened without me. I've ignored myself for too long, it feels like I took a wrong turn somewhere, went missing and just kept losing myself more and more.

At 20 I was commuting to uni and kept to myself. The lack of social interaction and procrastination made me drop out. I thought moving abroad could help me change. In reality, I was only trying to hide from my problems, as I couldn't bring myself to open up to people, which was all I really needed. Once I moved, the novelty of it all helped me distract myself, but it was all very much the same lonely life. I wanted to stop doing drugs and get my shit together, only to slip again and repeat all the same mistakes. 5 years working part time jobs I didn't care about and a collection of missed opportunities for growth and relationships (in London, which makes the feeling of wasting chances even worse, as there is such an abundance of everything that you really have to make an effort not to get anything out of it). I just kept floundering. 

Only difference, my first romantic relationship, for which I'm grateful. After the breakup I realised this was probably what I really missed out on all these years, how enriching it is to be vulnerable and intimate with someone. 
I wasn't honest with myself even after the second time I dropped out of uni. Only after the breakup, and a period of sobriety, I really broke down. This is why I think if I had to blame one thing as the source of all my problems, I'd say it is this. Not allowing myself to feel loved and accepted just fuelled my insecurities and sent me into this vicious cycle of avoiding people, trying to compensate and distract myself with things like moving, living on my own, fending for myself while studying things I didn't care too much about, and at the same time using drugs, self sabotaging and giving up because underneath I knew I just was missing the whole point.

I've been sober since January and in therapy. Never really considered ending things, I just don't want to go back abusing substances as I know something (like the breakup this year) might come my way again and wake me up in a few years, with even more regrets, sending me in a worse place yet. What scares me is that I still don't feel like things are real, that confronting the damage to my life was now inevitable, but not enough to really shake me and bring me back inside my head. I still feel disconnected. I have the same insecurities of my teenager self, plus the failures of my early 20s. If I didn't have the strength to change when I had so much more in front of me, how could I now? I know I have my whole life ahead, I just can't let go of the fantasy of what could've been, and start picturing a future based on my current reality.

It's my 4th year in college and I won't be graduating for another year's time, plus I haven't made any friends while here, so maybe that's whats getting me down.

Anyways I've been trying to remind myself each day that regardless of how I'm doing now that I know how to manage my depression I just need to keep at it. Last year around this time I was 22 without a driver's license, job, or any friends, and constantly in danger of losing my financial aid along with my apartment. And I felt like a failure. 

Fast forward to today and I drive almost every day, got an internship lined up for the Summer, made contact with some old friends and opened up about my depression to some of them, and I'm making straight B's in all my classes.

A comforting thought is that maybe me from a year ago would be happy to see where I am today, even if it's not a drastic change.

67,Getting over Depression : A basic blueprint,"I tried sharing my experience at Depression subredit but the moderator deleted my post from there. So, trying again with my post.

***Depression*** , after having faced it recently , one thing I can say for sure is that , one has to experience it in order to understand it.

Loosing focus , being tired even though one had done nothing throughout the day , being numb and pretty much disconnected from inside. It took me some time to even realize that something beyond a “bad mood” is happening. Something which is not normal. If you have already crossed that stage of realization then you are already on a really good start.

Sharing with you few steps which really helped me from then onwards and I feel are necessary for speedy and core recovery (I felt speed was important since patience takes a toll) -

1.) Start ***counselling*** with a psychologist.

This step is really important in order to keep your thought process positive apart from immense help in dealing with any emotional issues the right way (which were probably one of the reasons for your depression) . Right guidance plays a very big role here.

2.) If you feel unmanageable physical symptoms like high anxiety , which is impacting your professional/personal life , then you can take medical support from ***psychiatrist***. Please remember that these medications are like pain killers which make you comfortable temporarily while you are working on the root cause with your psychologist. Please don't stop your counselings after starting medications as it might give you a false impression that you “feel” OK . ***Medication is temporary but necessary too***l.

3.) ***Take it slow*** , understand that in depression your energy levels might get pretty low sometimes and IT IS OK. Don't be harsh on yourself if you are not able to meet older/expected speed in anything. Remember , ***progress is progress , no matter how small***.

4.) ***PLAN*** for low points . basically assume that you would be getting low points more frequently and of longer length probably , so plan for them. Eg : while making any commitment in work you can keep a buffer “low time” , taking your manager in confidence also helps sometimes but it depends on how much you trust him. Also make a list of basic things that you need to do definitely in your low time like getting out of bed , taking bath , brushing your teeth , having breakfast , going for walk , talking to someone etc. and during your really low points try sticking to your list.

4.) Don't try to look for interests or passions in your feelings in this phase, as it will in turn give you disappointment , focus more on making a ***routine*** for yourself and sticking to it. As it is said “looking for more positive experience is a negative experience , while ***ACCEPTANCE*** of one's negative experience in itself is a positive experience “ . To be able to stick to a basic routine in itself is a very big challenge during this phase. Positive actions will generate more calm and interest feelings.

5.) Take 1–2 people you trust , in confidence about your condition, with whom you can share about your experience and who can also support you during this time. ***Faith*** is important , as sometimes it is the only thing you have which keeps you going , and having a few people around who supports you , can really help. You can share within your family also if you feel they will be of any positive help to you , but sometimes they don't , in that case try to create distance from any negativity or drama. You can also look online for any such meetups where people come and share their experiences and battles (it really helps to know that there are more out there like you and how they fought depression. It strengthens your faith more).

6.) Go through a ***medical checkup*** of basic blood tests like thyroid , blood sugar , cholesterol , gut issues , hormonal imbalance etc . Most of the times depression is coupled with some physical issue as well (apart from emotional) and treating it also speeds up your recovery. It will also be a part of your “core solution” to depression and ensuring what you need to take care of in future to avoid a relapse.

7.) Once you feel that you are gaining momentum , educate yourself as much as you can through self help books or online articles. You can check with your psychologist also. Try to be more specific in this education eg: if you are diagnosed with few strong negative traits (that will happen in initial stage of your counselings) then look for sources on that topic instead of general depression books or if you are diagnosed of thyroid , then seek professional endocrinologist help for it and read more sources about how to change your lifestyle around it. So , basically ***EDUCATE*** yourself.

8.)***PRIORITISE*** your health above everything else , if possible. Sometimes taking a break from job also is OK if really needed but ensure financial backup before doing that.

9.) ***Workout*** in any form is really helpful .

Don't get disheartened if you are not able to achieve your goals for a time being, as you will definitely rise much higher and brighter once this is over. Also , I still get low at times which means I am also not totally cured , but I plan to stick to above things as much as I can. Also , please don't get scared by the length of this post .. I added all this to my routine very very slowly one by one over a period of almost 1 year. 

Hope this helps.

Edit 1:  Thanks everyone for such a good response. One more thing which I want to add is ***Sunlight***.  Normal 10 min walk or even sitting where you can get natural light really really works wonders for your moods and overall energy levels.",1522222099.0

I wasn't sure where to post this question, but since this subreddit is all about mental health I thought it would work fine.

I am a male living in the Netherlands and have experienced depression my whole live (with anxiety on top of it recently). I am feeling absolutely god awful these past couple od days because of everything that is going on with the george floyd protests and violence in America. I saw the entire video amd it made me sick to my stomach, I already donated quite a lot of money and have tried to pursuade people near me to do the same (since i am basically on the other side of the planet I can't do much more than this..)

I want to help the protests, join them and make a change. I am feeling an insane amount of empathy and sorrowness for the black people in America. This entire shitshow has made me realise how awful i've been to some people throughout my life and this makes me feel even worse.

I have tried to focus on my own stuff, avoid social media, distract myself etc but nothing works. I can barely eat, sleep and enjoy things and am afraid my depression will get worse.

73,"Having your shit together doesn’t mean you have no shortcomings. It means you acknowledge them, take responsibility for them, and take practical steps to keep them from harming you or others.","We all know nobody’s perfect, but it can feel like we have to be perfect to avoid bad outcomes, like losing friends or being unable to find a job or having serious health problems or money problems. 

I’m coming to realize the people I like and respect still struggle and have things they aren’t good at. But instead of letting those struggles overwhelm them, they acknowledge them as a practical problem to cope with. Sometimes that means taking gradual steps to get better at something, sometimes it means finding alternative ways to get something done or take responsibility for something so it doesn’t affect others as badly. 

Example: I’m not good at grocery shopping. It stresses me out. I used to respond by forcing myself to go to the store, having a panic attack, impulse buying stuff I couldn’t afford and/or not buying the things I came for. It led to me ordering a lot of takeout and eating really unhealthy and wasting a lot of money. It got so much better when I began ordering groceries for curbside pickup; I can now avoid the stressful part of shopping and still get the benefits of healthy eating and saving money. 

Example: when I’ve had people who have to cancel plans a lot because of health problems or other limitations, I’m much likelier to want to keep being friends with them if they let me know ahead of time, apologize, and say something like “I still really want to hang out, let’s talk tomorrow about rescheduling for next weekend.” I’m more likely to feel unappreciated if they don’t acknowledge the issue and don’t take responsibility for making sure plans can eventually happen. 

It can be hard to even own your stuff on this level if your life circumstances are so chaotic that you can’t even come up with workarounds or take responsibility for finding alternative solutions to problems. If that’s the case I think resolving the chaos should be your number one priority—finding a job that’s not so stressful or getting out of the toxic relationship or treating the chronic health problems, for example. You need a certain baseline of stability in your life to have room to do this stuff. I’m not saying give up if you don’t have that, I’m saying make working towards it a priority and forgive yourself for not being able to meet other goals right now.",1669006444.0
74,I just found out this morning that I failed my board exam. I feel incredibly disheartened and frustrated.,"I feel disheartened, bummed, upset, frustrated, etc. (any negative emotion you can possibly think of).

I did so well on my practice tests and that's why I decided to go ahead and take it.

I've had such a tough journey in school. I failed a year and had to repeat it. Every summer, I had to fly back and retake exams. It sucked.

I graduated medical school 2 years ago and had been using that time to take my board exams. The first part I passed, but barely (this was in January). Then I got extremely distracted/consumed by a potential relationship that did not work out. I was devastated and it had taken me months to move past it, tbh. During that time I was studying for this most recent exam. I had taken it on October 1st feeling confident. I will say that the night before I was feeling anxious and had trouble sleeping. But I felt okay when I took the actual test.

It sucks because a lot of these programs that I plan on applying to, they place emphasis on exam scores.

I'm frustrated because after a difficult year, I was hoping for some relief. I didn't want to study anymore. I was hoping I'd be done with that for a while and I could focus on my job applications and getting good letters of recommendation for an externship that I've been participating in since I finished. I had one more English test that I'm required to take and I already paid for it and scheduled it for next month. I have scheduled a trip to see my friends in Canada just to get a way for a bit later this month (tbh I don't think I want to forgo that. I'd like to get out of here for a bit).

It was like a virus had hijacked my sanity. When I felt like I could not live anymore, I just willed myself to be perfectly still, afraid of what I might do if I left the bed.

I quit my job, moved in with my parents, started to take meds, got therapy, enrolled in a writing class, and after a couple of months took a part time job as a teacher.

I feel that people who are normal don't have anything amazing on us. It is just that subconscious feeling of hope that gives them that slight nudge to stop being anxious about small insignificant things. 

The other thing I noticed during my ongoing improvement is that everyone has those ""up"" days where things seem good for a couple of days every month. I used to take these as signs of improvement.

# Curing Chronic Depression — Without Drugs

I  wrote this last year as a rough guide to help people with depression.  It is what I wish I had known when I had my first episode. I am  considering creating a more complete guide, if I receive a positive  response.

You  can not expect to live the same life and expect depression to go away.  You must change; this means changing your thinking, diet and life.  Depression entices you to be with her, lures you into the depths. She is  very difficult to let go because she is a part of you, and somehow, you  do not really want to be without her. If you have had depression for a  long time, then I suggest attacking it from many angles. One alone will  not suffice, you have to change.

Depression  is not a mental disease. Depression is the mental manifestation of a  physical ailment. Your mind does not run on pixy dust and rainbows but  on very controlled levels of neurotransmitters. It is when these get out  of proportion issues start. Neurotransmitters are physical, and  consequently, you depend on food to produce them in the correct  proportions. The important thing to realise is that ‘you’ that thing  inside your head, your conscious self, is the results of chemical  interactions happening in our physical world. If you do not like the  sound of that, then I suggest you realise not liking the sound of  something does not make it false.

I  cured my depression through systematic analysis over years. No single  factor eliminated it, but it was the culmination of considerable mental  effort, combined with micronutrients. Moreover, herein lies the  conundrum, the micronutrient discovery came at the tail end of my  journey, would it have been expedited had I started using micronutrients  earlier? I believe so. My depression was seriously exacerbated by a  micronutrient imbalance.

I  am a highly sceptical individual, and rarely take things at face value.  The work here is the culmination of huge amounts of research, reading,  and experimentation; it isn’t the result of quackery but considered the  thought.

**What is depression?**

Depression  seems to be the consequence of an inflammatory disease, which can be  partially characterised by high levels of C\-reactive protein and reduced  levels of Fractional exhaled nitric oxide \(FeNO\).

*C\-reactive protein is “a marker of inflammatory disease, have been documented in subjects with depression”.*

*Fractional  exhaled nitric oxide \(FeNO\), “in addition to being an inflammatory  mediator, is also a neurotransmitter at the neuron synapses. It  modulates norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate and thus is  speculated to play a role in the pathogenesis of depression” \(Cepeda,  Stang, & Makadia, 2016\).*

Is  this inflammation the consequence of thought patterns, or issues in the  physical world? I believe it can be both, but in cases of chronic  depression, I believe physical issues are the trigger and through  patterns exacerbate the issue.

If  then the cause is physical, then what might that cause be? It almost  certainly changes from person to person. However, there are some western  world dietary traits which exacerbate inflammation, and therefore if we  can reduce inflammation, our depression might reduce.

**The ratio of Omega\-3 and Omega\-6 fatty acids**

Virtually  all of us have an unhealthy ratio of omega\-6s and omega\-3s in our diet;  the typical western diet has a ratio of 14:1. So why is that  significant? Firstly it appears evolutionary we evolved on a ratio  closer to 1:1, \(Simopoulos, 2002\).

“Many  of the chronic conditions — cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer  obesity, autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and  depression — are associated with increased production of thromboxane,  leukotriene, tumour necrosis factor, and c\-reactive protein. All these  factors increase by the increase in the omega\-6 fatty acid intake and  decrease by increases in omega\-3 fatty acid intake.” \(Simopoulos &  Cleland, 2003\)

So  what does this mean for depression, it means that if you have high  levels of omega\-6 in your diet compared to omega\-3 you are more at risk  of high levels of inflammation and therefore developing depression. It’s  not as simple as saying low levels of omega\-3 causes depression, but it  can be a contributing factor.

**Zinc Deficiency**

“Zinc  Deficiency can cause intestinal hyperpermeability \(“leaky gut”\), which  itself can be secondary to increased nitric oxide and oxidative stress  \(Skrovanek, 2014\).” Essentially if you don’t get enough zinc, the tight  junctions between cells in the intestines can loosen, and molecules  deleterious to health can pass into the body, causing an immune response  and hence increasing inflammation and consequent depression.

A  study recently showed that “zinc supplementation together with SSRIs  antidepressant drug improves major depressive disorders more effectively  in patients with placebo plus antidepressants \(SSRIs\).”

A  book looking at Nutritional Deficiency states “Recent clinical  research, indicated that the serum zinc level in patients with  depression was significantly lower than in the control group. Other  studies have also shown that low serum zinc levels are normalized during  treatment with antidepressants” \(Rafalo, 2016\)

It’s  quite clear that zinc like omega\-3 has the potential to play a role in  depression. Which is why depression sufferers should increase their  intake of zinc.

**Magnesium Deficiency**

“Almost  half \(48&#37;\) of the US population consumed less than the required amount  of magnesium from food in 2005–2006, and the figure was down from 56&#37; in  2001–2002” \(Rosanoff, Weaver, & Rude, 2012\)

“Sixty  percent of cases of clinical depression are considered to be  treatment\-resistant depression \(TRD\). Magnesium\-deficiency causes  N\-methyl\-d\-aspartate \(NMDA\) coupled calcium channels to be biased  towards opening, causing neuronal injury and neurological dysfunction,  which may appear to humans as major depression. Oral administration of  magnesium to animals led to antidepressant\-like effects that were  comparable to those of strong anti\-depressant drugs. Cerebral spinal  fluid \(CSF\) magnesium has been found low in treatment\-resistant suicidal  depression and in patients that have attempted suicide.” \(Eby &  Eby, 2010\)

Low  levels of magnesium are proven to affect mood and increase anxiety; if  you suffer from anxiety, I implore you to buy some magnesium. It is a  simple fix for a seemingly incurable disease. Low magnesium also causes  restless leg syndrome and muscle cramps. The majority of us don’t get  enough magnesium, and it is extremely difficult to get enough from your  diet, due to modern farming practices. So if you want to brighten up  your world, take a little magnesium.

**Calcium**

Calcium  is a weird one; there aren’t many studies linking it to depression.  However, it is on my list because I believe it helps me, you may be  different. Those who suffer from anxiety should avoid taking calcium, as  high levels of calcium have been linked to anxiety. For some people,  high levels of calcium can trigger depression, though this might be a  consequence of having low magnesium to start. So if you are going to  supplement calcium, then make sure you take magnesium too.

**Vitamin D**

Vitamin  D is a group of fat\-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing  intestinal absorption of calcium and magnesium. Our ancestors spent most  of their time outside, but we don’t, so you are unlikely to produce  enough vitamin D from sun exposure.

Virtually everyone should supplement with vitamin D, specifically Vitamin D3.

**Lithium Orotate**

Lithium  has a bad reputation because of its use with Bi\-polar disorder, where  large doses are used. These large doses come with unpleasant side  effects. My lithium dose is 5mg which his 1/200 of a typical medical  dose. I find supplementing with lithium reduces rumination and suicide  idealisation.

There is evidence which suggests that suicide rates are reduced in areas with high levels of lithium in tap water. \(Fels, 2014\).

**My doses**

Omega  3 — Minimum of 1g/day of EPA and DHA from capsules, and one tin of  mackerel or piece of salmon daily. If you are starting out, you should  try to get more than 1g/day, maybe more than 3 grams per day for the  first few weeks. This normally equates to about ten capsules of omega\-3.  Mak sure you purchase Omega\-3, not fish oil, and ensure there are  minimal levels of vitamin A and no omega\-6 in the capsules.

Calcium  666mg, don’t go mad. I take this much because I have a combination of  zinc calcium and magnesium in one tablet, it seems to be the right level  for me.

Magnesium  255mg, you might want to take more of this, especially if you are  suffering from anxiety. Bear in mind magnesium is a laxative so if you  take too much, you are going to have a bad time.

Zinc 15–30mg, I think this level is fine. Don’t go crazy, but up to 50mg would probably be ok.

Vitamin  D3 5000iu which is the same as 250µg, it’s quite a lot of vitamin D,  but unless you work outside you are almost certainly deficient, so get  it in you!

Lithium  orotate 131mg which is the same as 5mg of elemental lithium, I take  this when I feel myself ruminating too much, and when the world seems to  be getting a bit to grey.

Avoid multivitamins you need to be specific with the minerals you are taking.

**Diet**

I  function and feel best on a very low carbohydrate diet. No grains,  legumes, potatoes, etc. My only carbs come from vegetables. I dip in and  out of ketosis which is when the body does not have enough glucose for  energy, and burns stored fats instead. This diet has been very  successful at treating a variety of neurological disorders; it has been  suggested it can reduce inflammation too, which is a win. To learn more,  listen to the two podcasts on — [https://tim.blog/2016/07/06/dom\-dagostino\-part\-2/](https://tim.blog/2016/07/06/dom-dagostino-part-2/)

Avoid all oils except, butter, ghee, olive oil, avocado oil, and coconut oil.

Fish,  fish and more fish. Don’t like fish? Learn to cook it properly. My  favourite is mackerel because its cheap and has shed loads of omega 3.  Buy it tinned or fresh. Don’t like mackerel get salmon! Every fish  tastes different if you don’t like one try another, but make sure it’s  oily, it is that simple.

Eat  loads of green vegetables; kale is cheap and tasty fried with lots of  oil and salt. Broccoli sprouts are awesome too, Another interesting  podcast [https://tim.blog/2017/05/04/smart\-drugs\-fasting\-and\-fat\-loss/](https://tim.blog/2017/05/04/smart-drugs-fasting-and-fat-loss/) — don’t  jump into doing raw smoothies straight away as you will get the shits.  Your body doesn’t have the right bacteria to digest that much veg; I  learnt this the hard way…

**Food Intolerances**

I  have food intolerances you might not. If you do have intolerances, you  must find out what they are an stop eating that food. Intolerances are  an immune response and will cause inflammation and hence depression. If  you have IBS symptoms or similar, then your body is warning you, “There  is something you are feeding me that I don’t like!”, listen to your  body.

You  can get allergy tests at your doctors, or you can just cut things out  of your diet and see if you feel better. For me its dairy, gluten, oats  etc. carbs, and pork. Which sucks as I find all those things delicious,  but I’d rather not want to kill myself, so it’s the price I pay.

**Exercise**

Do  some, if you have depression and don’t exercise then you are giving up  the best depression cure around. Everyone is different; you need to find  out what you enjoy and pursue it. You don’t have to go to a gym and  grind it out… You can do a routine at home, or outside. There are  innumerable exercise videos on youtube, check some out.

Walking  can help, but you have to walk for a few hours. I suggest getting a  podcast on something interesting, not the news or current affairs, and  go for a stroll. Concentrate on the podcast, connect the most salient  points and try to remember it. You are trying to break your thought  patterns, and this takes effort. When you get home to try to recall as  much as you can.

**Sleep**

Insomnia  and poor sleep play a huge part in depression. I believe a particularly  bad stretch of insomnia may have triggered my depression. I still have  insomnia to this day; I’m just better at dealing with it. If you focus  on how badly you slept, you will feel worse. Try to just get on with  your day.

Deliberate  sleep deprivation can temporarily reduce depression, but this cure the  underlying cause. It is not something I’ve experimented with. The vast  majority of people with depressive symptoms seem to suffer from lack of  sleep in some form or another. The best book I’ve read on sleep is “The  sleep book” [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep\-Book\-Well\-Every\-Night/dp/1409149102](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/1409149102)

**Drugs and Alchohol**

If  you’re drinking a lot and are depressed, then stop! Take responsibility  for your life, accept that you have to change. Don’t make excuses, stop  drinking. Tobacco and nicotine are a given, don’t blame your addiction.

Same  goes for cocaine, MDMA, and marijuana. Yes, weed is in there, smoking  to satiate your need to do nothing is not the answer. Maybe you feel  like you need it to relax, but if you’re not relaxed it is because your  mind is telling you to change something! Only you can figure out what  that is. There is evidence that CBD oil may reduce depression and  anxiety, but it isn’t an area which I’ve explored.

Ketamine  and psilocybin are touted as two wonder depression drugs, they have  their place, but they won’t cure depression by themselves.

Someone  I know used Ketamine it took the depression away for a couple of weeks,  the next time it was a little over a week. Then a few days. It  eventually completely stopped doing anything. It doesn’t sound like the  best route.

Magic  mushrooms take away suicide idealisation, which makes a huge difference  when treating depression. If you take them regularly, you will spend a  little less time in this world, things of consequence with getting  pushed to the sidelines indefinitely. If you are on the ragged edge,  these help you, read up about them.

**Memorising things**

Memorising  things helped me to stop ruminating \(the act of thinking someone over  and over\). I would sit down and memorise a speech, poem or a quote,  something that interested me, that’s all there is to do. It is hard, and  it will tax your mind, but that’s the point, you must commit. It is  rewarding when you can hear your subconscious repeating a poem in the  background of your mind. Memorising poems means when you start  ruminating you can just recall your stored poems and block out the sound  of your thoughts.

**Meditation and mindfulness**

I  don’t buy into the whole spiritualness, but I do believe meditation can  calm the mind. Its useful for when you need to slow things down and  concentrate. You might have prejudices against this, but you’re the one  reading this guide on how to get rid of depression. So it might be worth  putting them to the side for a moment looking up some of the research  that is out there.

For guided meditation, there is a course called headspace which is quite good.

The  best book I’ve read on meditation is “The Attention Revolution:  Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind”, but I’m sure there are better  ones.

**Stop listening to sad music**

You  have to give it up, if it makes you sad then that’s probably not a good  thing, you are emotionally unstable after all. It sucks because these  are probably many of your favourite songs, but if you’re reading this,  then you probably have a problem. That means being realistic. Give these  up and listen to positive music. If that’s not your scene, then grow  up. Nobody cares about what music you listen too. If you feel your music  defines you, then you’re just defining yourself as being miserable… Is  it worth it?

**Don’t read the news, use Facebook and social media sparingly**

Does  the news matter? The answer is no; it only serves to satiate the human  desire for gossip, all the news is global gossip. Read something  informative. There’s plenty of things out there; you must find an  interest and pursue it.

Only when you take responsibility for everything that happens in your life can you move forward.

**End toxic friendships and relationships**

Don’t hang around people that make you feel bad, and you will start feeling better.

**Set achievable goals and pursue them**

You  won’t change your life unless you have direction and for that you need  goals. They don’t have to be big; they can be simple like: buy the  micronutrients on the list, take the micronutrients every day for a  week, cook a meal with fish and vegetables. As you grow so can the  goals.

**If you are unhappy with something to change it**

Not  happy with your job, then you’ve got to change it. You can do so much  more than you know, but you have to set goals, break them down into  steps and work them. You have to figure out what those are; maybe you  are in a state where you don’t know. Or you are not sure which direction  to take. But sitting with your wheels spinning won’t help, action  creates action. By just starting you will make progress. Perhaps have a  diary which you can put in your goals for the day, just make them  realistic, if you’re just starting out you’re not magically going be a  god. Build up begin with small achievements, so you know what it is like  to win.

“For  God’s sake Don’t be paralysed by choices. That’s nonsensical and  unproductive. Get on with making your choices. Put another way to  achieve your goals you have to prioritise and that includes rejecting  good alternatives.” — Ray Dalio, Principles

**Accept when you are not good at something and seek help**

No  everyone can be great at everything, you simply don’t have enough time.  However, there is always someone who is great, and they might help you  if you are willing to help them.

Focus on your strengths, and use other peoples for your weaknesses.

**Cold water therapy**

There  is some evidence to suggest that having cold showers can improve mood  and reduce anxiety \(Shevchuk, 2008\). I do it occasionally because I’m a  masochist, and believe in voluntary hardship, where you should do  unpleasant things to condition you to enjoy the good things in life  more.

A good podcast on this method is [https://tim.blog/2015/09/07/the\-iceman\-wim\-hof/](https://tim.blog/2015/09/07/the-iceman-wim-hof/)

An interesting video is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMjhwFE1Zw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMjhwFE1Zw)

**Tumeric**

Or  specifically, a molecule in turmeric curcumin has been linked to  lowering inflammation and hence reducing depression \(KULKARNI, 2010\).  It’s worth buying some fresh turmeric and cooking with it, a few times a  week, it is tasty and good for you.

**Recommended reading**

The  goal of this section is to change your thinking if you’ve had  depression for a long time you have fundamentally altered your brain.  You need to fix it.

**Help books**

**Man’s Search for Meaning —** a  book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his experiences as an Auschwitz  concentration camp inmate during World War II, and describing his  psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a purpose in life  to feel positive about. I highly recommend this.

**The magic of thinking big** — basically  as self helpy as a book can get, incredibly cheesy, but you will feel  like a powerful 1950s man once you’re done with this.

**The subtle art of not giving a fuck** — Exactly what it says on the tin. If you were only allowed to give five fucks a week, you would use them sparingly.

**Principles** Ray Dalio — very useful for those who tend to tend to spin their wheels when choosing a direction to take.

I know some people won’t have the money to spend on books so for you

**As a man Thinketh**, — here is a pdf link — [https://wahiduddin.net/thinketh/as\_a\_man\_thinketh.pdf](https://wahiduddin.net/thinketh/as_a_man_thinketh.pdf)

Lots  of audiobooks can be found on youtube, if you find something you like,  just search for it! By starting a healthy diet of quality literature you  will be all the better for it.

My personal favourites are:

The Count of Monte Crito — Alexandra Dumas

Frankenstein — Mary  Shelly, this is a brilliant read — Frankenstein’s monster is an  eloquent beast, his final words, are some of my favourites in all that I  have read, which is probably over 500 books now.

In Search of Lost Time, Marcel Proust — A masterpiece, but massive, it certainly isn’t for everyone.

Keep in mind this is my own process and struggle to climb out of the sinkhole known as depression. I wanted to share this in the chance it could give even just one person hope of a life of relief. It was removed from /r/depression so I had to repost here. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------

14 is when my depression starting manifesting. I had no idea what caused it. I had no idea why I felt that way. My blame went to everything wrong in my life. I was depressed because my dad drank. I was depressed because my sister hit me. I was depressed because the guy I liked rejected me. When that feeling came from no where, I had no choice but to latch on to anything negative and make that the source. I did this for years. Honestly, I thought it was just what being a teenager was like.

I was well into my Junior year of High School (17 years old) before I couldn't take it any more. I was tired of crying myself to sleep. There would be days where my hands would shake as I held everything inside. People and places would whirlwind through my life as I felt like the only solid object. With those shaking hands, I held up a little sign in literature class that said ""I NEED TO GO TO THE COUNSELOR, NOW!"" until my teacher saw it. She nodded and I bolted out of class to the whispers of the other students. But I didn't care.

So I'm 17 years old and crying to my counselor. I was terrified of bringing it up to my parents because I didn't want them to think I was making excuses. She agreed she'd call my parents and let them know I seem sincere and she genuinely believed I needed to go see a doctor.
A couple of days passed without incident. I was in the kitchen and my dad came in. We chatted for a bit before he awkwardly mentioned he got a call from my counselor. Here it is. The moment of truth. He continued on to say he called his doctor and set up an appointment for me so I could see about getting on some medication. Relief washed over me. I'm grateful my parents understood.

I don't remember really noticing a difference with my medication. I guess part of me had gotten so used to the depression, I didn't bother going back to the doctor. I told myself I was just going to always be that way. Suicide was always on my mind, but I always crossed it out.
Graduation came and went. I was in College. Drunken nights of me crying under my bed because I just hurt so badly on the inside. I'm depressed because I'm not all A's like I was used to be. I'm depressed because I'm single. I'm depressed because I'm stressed about money. If things would be perfect, I would finally be happy.

Sophomore year I reached the peak. I had my meltdown. I went full Fukushima. My relationship was toxic and unhealthy. But we were so depressed we clung to each other. The rush of love chemicals we brought each other meant we made each other happy. Even if we'd pretend to kill ourselves for attention. Even if we'd forbid the other from going out so we could stay on skype and chat. Our only respite was feeling the rushes of dopamine when we spoke to each other. I'd tried to end it because I knew it was bad, but he threatened to kill himself. So there we were.

I cheated. It was wrong, but I learned to not regret it. It set in motion the chain of events that got me help. I quit school and laid in my bed at home for weeks. My $48k scholarship just gone. We skyped constantly still, even though he hated me. When he finally broke up with me, I was lost. My source of dopamine was gone. I was left in the dark.

I don't remember much about the following weeks. I know I told my mother I was flying out to see him and win him back. I was 21 years old playing a romance movie in my head of us reuniting. One in which I conveniently ignored he pretended to kill himself once. My mother knew I was bad and took me to the hospital. They checked me in for being suicidal.

A few weeks in and I felt better. New meds. New doctor. New outlook on life. Hotdog, I was cured! I walked out all sunshine and daisies just ready to live my life free of depression.

One week later I was back in my bed crying and binge watching tv shows. I couldn't stop eating. Seroquel had me going to the fridge in a daze as I shoveled food in my mouth. I gained 30 pounds in two months. I was depressed because I lost my scholarship. I was depressed because I was getting fat. I was depressed because I lost the love of my life.

My mother came into my room and told me to get a job or get out. I had one month. I was furious and depressed. How could she do this to me? She had depression as well and knew how it was. She was going to kick out her baby for being sick?

Facing the reality of living in my car with no money, I pulled myself up every day to find a job. Life was bad, but it'd be worse being homeless. Admittedly, I felt a bit better after finding a job. I had something to do. Hey, maybe she had a point. The day I came home from my first day of work, my father drunkenly threatened to kill me. I stood toe to toe with with a grown man as he yelled in my face. I packed my car and left at 12am and ended up at my grandma's.

Dodging my father's alcoholic threats, I went to work shaking and sick. I was now on Effexor and I could barely walk. Vertigo would hit me or brain zaps would attack. I was dating someone new, which was my only source of happiness.

My corporate job was killing me. I was a cog in the machine. I was a number and an asinine rating. I was depressed because my job sucked. I was depressed because I didn't have a career. I was depressed because my boyfriend was long distance.

I was 22 before the thought hit me. I'm depressed because I have depression. Nothing is making me depressed other than my own brain. That moment of clarify was the turning point.

I was done. I was fucking done living like that. I was 22 years old and condemning myself to a life of depression. Before, I had done the bare minimum to say I was ""trying"". I took medicine and hoped it would cure me. I went to a few therapy sessions and thought I'd be saved. I did a few pep talks and thought it'd make me see things positively. I wasn't trying, I was going through the motions so I could say ""I tried and it didn't work"". I had became so used to my depression, I wasn't fighting it back.

My job sucks? I make good money and can easily save to go back to school. I don't have a career? I pay almost no rent and have very few bills. I can save loads of money. My boyfriend is long distance? I still get to see him and he supports and loves me. Every negative thought I forced myself to see the good. It didn't happen naturally. It didn't fix my depression. But it did set me up to completely rewire how I thought.

For two years I actively visited the doctor to work on my medication. I gave it a chance. My doctor suggested Vitamin B Complex and Vitamin D. So I took those every day. In three months, I noticed a difference. Every day I spoke positively to myself. All my negative experiences were in the past. They were bad, but I learned from them. They made me compassionate and understanding. I'm not depressed because of them. I'm depressed because I have depression, a treatable disease.

Slowly, I found myself in a much better mood most of the time. With one exception, my menstrual cycle. I could feel it pulling me back down. All of my progress would shake and I just knew I was going to lose it. No. I had worked my ass off and I couldn't let it happen. I went right back to my doctor and told him. Take Calcium! So I took that dang calcium. I took it every day. In four months, I noticed the difference.

One day it hit me, I felt like I was in a new life. My situation hadn't changed, but my health and thought process had. For years I reprogrammed myself to counter negative thoughts with the silver lining. My body and mind felt stable. I was 24 and felt younger than I had at 17.

Then my boyfriend dumped me. For nearly three years I had him there to support me. We had talked about marriage. I had just gotten healthy. Why would he leave me now? Why couldn't I enjoy my happiness? For two full days I cried and refused to eat. After the shock wore off, I found an odd relief. I wasn't depressed. I was sad. Immediately I started crying again from the realization. I had forgotten what sadness felt like; all I had known for years was depression. No suicidal thoughts. No body shaking pain. Just calm sadness.

I knew I had done it. Even through mourning a relationship, I enjoyed my achievement. Out of awards, scholarships, and titles, this was the proudest I had ever been. I actually worked hard and struggled. I came close to suicide. But there I was: Happy.

--------------------------------------------------------------

My depression isn't gone. It's never gone. But I'm in control. I might see it one or two days a month, but it's so docile it's laughable compared to what it used to be. I've quit my job and used my savings to go back to school. I'm living with my new boyfriend. I have a future now.
It was hell. Every minute was hell. It was hard. I struggled. I got close to not making it. But I did. It's possible.


Edit: I got accused of being anti-med. I'm on medication. I just take vitamins as well.

Edit 2: I got asked to be more specific about the medicine. I'll copy paste here:

The biggest help was taking Effexor. I take a very high dosage (300mg, but I'm going to see about going down to 225mg).

B complex and Vitamin D just help. B complex helps with energy, which can help mood. Vitamin D helps with brain function and supplements the Effexor. A lot of doctors think PMS mood swings are an issue with calcium deficiency. It's also sorta related to how older women need more calcium. So calcium has actually helped my mood swings, so they're onto something there.

Changing my thought process helps me on a general basis to be more upbeat and positive. So when my depression does come back around, I immediately known to combat the thoughts.",1501783175.0

86,Overcoming Depression (Overview and Tips),"Are you feeling depressed, or do you know someone else who is? Read on to find about more about what it is it, and learn a number strategies to help prevent it, or reduce the severity of the symptoms if you have it.

&#x200B;

**INTRO**

Depression is a common mental health problem, which can be really serious, and is prevalent throughout the world. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.

Depression is usually assessed on a degree of severity, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe. It should be treated quite seriously, because in the more severe cases it can lead to self-harm and even suicide.

&#x200B;

**SYMPTOMS**

Depression can include a wide variety of symptoms which affect our mood, emotions and behaviours. Some of these include feeling sad, irritability, worthless, empty, hopeless, suicidal and numb.

Behavioural changes can include: avoiding social interaction, lack of interesting in hobbies, loss of sex drive, memory problems, lack of energy, sleeping trouble, no appetite, change in weight, use of drugs and alcohol etc.

&#x200B;

**CAUSE**

Depression is believe to be caused by a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors.

Some of these known risk factors include: childhood adversity, bereavement, abuse (physical, sexual, emotional, neglect), bullying, unemployment, divorce, significant stress, medical diagnosis, prolonged isolation etc. Some studies show that biological factors, such as genetics, and hormones, may also contribute to the development of depression.

&#x200B;

**TIP #1: CBT**

CBT stands for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, which is a commonly prescribed treatment for a variety of mental health problems including depression. CBT is based on the concept that our thoughts, feelings and behaviours are all related and can affect each other.

For example, we may experience negative feelings which we believe are objectively true, but on closer inspection they are partially caused by unhealthy and distorted thought patterns. Once we become away of what these thought patterns are, we can label them, and try to change them into more healthy and positive and ones. This, in turn, may affect our behaviours.

You can do this be familiarising yourself with cognitive distortions, which are exaggerated or irrational thought patterns. Here are some of the most common ones:

**1. All-or-Nothing Thinking:** Evaluating the self, as well as events in life in extreme terms. It is either all good or all bad, either black or white, nothing in between

**2. Overgeneralization:** Making hasty generalizations from insufficient evidence. Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence.

**3. Mental Filter:** Focusing entirely on negative elements of a situation to the exclusion of the positive. Also, the brain's tendency to filter information that does not conform to already-held beliefs.

**4. Disqualifying the Positive:** Discounting positive events

**5. Jumping to Conclusions:** Reaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence.

**6. Magnification and Minimization:** Giving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as ""making a mountain out of a molehill"".

**7. Emotional Reasoning:** Presuming that negative feelings expose the true nature of things and experiencing reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts. Thinking something is true, solely based on a feeling.

**8. Should Statements:** Expecting the world to be different than it is"". It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviours regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation.

**9. Labeling and Mislabeling:** A form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behaviour to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.

**10. Personalization:** Attributing personal responsibility, including the resulting praise or blame, to events over which the person has no control.

&#x200B;

**TIP #2: Exercise**

Regular exercise has been shown to help lower the effects of depression. This is due to several reasons including:

1. Taking our mind off worries - Rather than ruminating about problems, being proactive can help to distract us from negative cycles of thinking.
2. Releasing endorphins - feel good chemicals in the brain which can enhance our sense of well-being.
3. Confidence - you are actively trying to improve yourself, and becoming fitter at the same time, so you are naturally going to feel better about yourself.
4. Social interaction - joining the gym, going for a run in the park, or joining a sports team may introduce you to other like minded people.

&#x200B;

**TIP #3: Self-esteem**

A common problem associated with depression is low self-esteem. Whether low self-esteem is a cause or effect of depression, it doesn’t really matter, as long as we can identify it and begin to increase it.

Aside from reframing any negative beliefs and thought patterns, outlined in TIP #1, you can also raise self-esteem by trying to improve yourself and your life in a number of ways:

**1) Skills and talents**: Learn a new skill, take up a new hobby and increase your repertoire of talents.

**2) Achievements**: Set goals, and aim to accomplish them. A sense of achievement can do wonders for self-esteem.

**3) Relationships**: Healthy relationships are really important to our overall sense of well being, so minimise negative and toxic ones, grow existing positives ones, and even seek out new ones if necessary.

**4) Self-compassion**: If you ever feel low, practice having compassion for yourself, like you would for a close friend or family member.

**5) Assertive communication**: Try to practice assertive communication more, instead of passive, aggressive, or passive-aggressive.

**6) Challenge and growth**: Growth is an important part of life, so every once in a while challenge yourself to come out of your comfort zone, and try something new.

**QUOTES**

To end this post, here’s a few of my favourite quotes related to depression:

>“Release of shame is an antidepressant.” \~ Johann Hari  
“Only in the darkness can you see the stars.” \~ Martin Luther King Jr  
“You're not a bad person for the ways you tried to kill your sadness.” \~ Unknown  
“Depression is your body saying 'fuck you, I don't want to be this character anymore’. I don’t want to hold up this avatar that you’ve created in a world that’s too much for me.” \~ Jim Carrey﻿  
“That's the thing about depression: A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious, and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to ever see the end.” \~ Elizabeth Wurtzel",1555099372.0

88,You cannot control what other people think about you.,"""The only thing you can do is the best you can at whatever task is before you. If your family or co workers or whomever want to say you're lazy or careless even though you are working hard - that is their failing and not yours."" 



This is something my psychiatrist told me after I spent 2 weeks in an inpatient facility following a suicide attempt. He went on: 



""When you try to tell them you are doing well when you are not, or hide things from them, this is you being very very controlling. They will think what they will think and if you try to control them you will just stress and waste a lot of energy and and ultimately become frustrated."" 



He had a really thick accent and I can hear it in my head as I type this. But goddamn if I don't remember every word. 

I have spent so much time trying to make sure everyone thinks the best of me, trying to make sure people don't worry about me, or don't judge me. 


Tonight in particular is a time I need to remember that. I thought I would share this sentiment with you folks, and maybe it will help you too. 


Don't be controlling. Let go of your concern for other people's idea of you. Just focus on you. Be as much you as you can today, even if that means something very small. 



The people who love you will be happy for your triumphs, no matter how miniscule they may seem. 

Everyone else can fuck off, yeah? ",1549697302.0
89,"8 years ago, I was suicidal. Today, life's pretty good.","&#x200B;

I'm writing this for anyone who is suffering more than normal at this time of year, to let you know that tomorrow can be different and you shouldn't give up.

**December 2010.**

My ex-partner had just had our twins, and I wasn't coping with the situation. Life wasn't what it should be, what I'd believed it could be.

&#x200B;

I hated my job but feared losing it.  I hated my ex-partner but feared been cut off from my babies.

&#x200B;

One night, it all got too much. I had a couple of drinks and firmed up my decision to end it all.  I knew how I was going to do it. I'd decided not to leave a note, I didn't need the extra pain of writing it.

&#x200B;

I was minutes away when I focused on a picture of my son and decided to phone The Samaritans.  The talked me down, and I went to the doctors the next day to start rebuilding my life.

&#x200B;

**December 2018**

I've been married for 3 years, I have a stepdaughter and a 3-year-old. I don't see my twins as often as I'd like... but because of their choice, not their mothers.

&#x200B;

I have a job I love, and can't remember the last time I felt overwhelmed by dark clouds.

It's been a journey I wouldn't wish on anyone.  In the beginning, every day was a challenge, and not every day was a step forward. But when I think of everything I'd have missed out on if I'd have ""opted-out"" then I know I made the right decision.

94,"I have no idea who I am, everything I do is performative because I have no passions, ambitions, or hobbies","Well, I do have one hobby, watching Youtube videos and Twitch streams to escape from my depression, but it's honestly pathetic and when someone asks me what my hobbies are, I'll say something like ""skiing and kayaking"", even though I do those things about 2 or 3 times each year. I think this is just one of many examples of how most of the things I do are based on what I perceive as socially normal or what others expect me to do. This, on top of the fact that I think that any trait I may have is matched with its opposite, makes it just impossible for me to know who I truly am. For example, I believe I am very argumentative by nature (in a devil's advocate way where I will take an opposing side to an argument for fun, which was always met with ""you're going to be such a good lawyer some day"") but at the same time, I am incredibly unconfrontational by nature as well and will often bend the knee to someone to avoid a fight. I also have flashes of being a total introvert (I'll lay in bed all day and have very little interaction with my roommates) as well as flashes of being a complete extrovert where I drive conversation in social settings. I do incredibly well and am a leader in group conversations and will often be the center of attention among the participants, yet when I give a presentation in front of a group of people, I have trouble breathing. Also contradictory to my ability to excel in group social settings is how awkward I feel one-on-one, even with people who I've known for years. There are very few people who I actually feel comfortable speaking with individually and I can't stand eye contact. Maybe it's because I feel more comfortable being an entertainer than opening up emotionally to people. To top it all off, as you may be able to tell, I'm a very self-analytical person and think a lot about my behavior, yet I have no idea who I am as a person. These are just a few examples of contradictory traits that I have, but you get the point.

On top of this, I have an absolute disinterest in every class that I take and have no idea what I'm going to do in a year and a half when I graduate college. I excelled in my classes from elementary to high school and because of that, attend one of the top universities in the country, where I met incredibly driven and intelligent people who have the rest of their lives planned out. When I was in high school and had no idea what I wanted in life, they told us that we weren't alone in that sentiment, and while that may have been true at my high school, this certainly wasn't the case in college. While I didn't care much about my classes up until college, at least I had this reassurance that I would eventually find my calling in life. Well, I'm about to turn 21, and that still hasn't happened. And I know people will say ""don't worry a lot of people don't know what they want in life at that age"", but that wasn't supposed to happen to ME. I grew up with a very structured life in an upper middle class neighborhood with lawyers for parents. Everyone, my neighbors, lower school classmates, and family have been made well aware of my ""intelligence"". As trivial as it is, I was the runner up for ""Most Likely to Succeed"" for my middle school's superlatives. My intelligence has always been the complete foundation for my self worth, and when I was bullied during my first two years of high school, what kept me going was knowing those kids would be working for me one day. That's almost completely gone at this point now that I'm surrounded by people who are smarter and more motivated than myself. A lot of people say not to compare yourself to others, but the fact of the matter is that if I turn out to just be mediocre, my peers will almost assuredly judge me, maybe not with malice, but with pity. The only positive trait that I can name about myself nowadays, especially since I've gained 25 pounds in 2 years and am on the fringe of weighing over 200 lbs and no longer would consider myself physically attractive, is that I'm pretty funny.

This ESPECIALLY isn't supposed to happen to me in the educational environment that I'm in now. Everyone has a plan and excels at and loves what they do. One of my roommates, a junior as well, already has a $170k a year job secured for after he graduates. Another one of my roommates is an engineering student and barely sleeps because he's always working, and the last is a premed student. Meanwhile, I'm a political science major who thought the idea of studying politics sounded cool until I actually started taking major specific classes and saw that literally everyone is obsessed with politics and spends hours everyday checking in on Congressional meetings and reading the news. I simply don't really care about our modern day politics; I think it's all a sham and we're led by incredibly narcissistic and selfish people. Really, law school seems like the only career path available after I graduate, but it's an incredibly labor intensive and expensive investment to make when I'm unsure of it. I'm absolutely not willing to take on the burden of student debt and take out a loan for it, and frankly I would have no idea how to approach my parents and ask them to pay for it since they do not shy away from reminding me how they've wasted over $100k so far on an education I neglect and don't take advantage of, which while totally valid, has been more detrimental to my mental health than they can comprehend. While I appreciate that they have somewhat attempted to by sympathetic towards my depression, they have refused to understand that guilting someone who already feels incredibly guilty is not an effective motivation tactic. When I am trying to put together scraps of any motivation I have left in the tank to write a paper that's two weeks late, my parents reminding me about the checks they have written and the checks that they will stop writing if I don't get the work done clogs my mind of the guilt I have for letting them and myself down, and that becomes my mind's focus rather than the paper.

I really just feel hopeless about my future and I don't feel like I'll ever find true happiness in whatever career path I settle for. I don't even know if I feel true emotions or if my brain tells my body ""this is how you're supposed to react"" and it does it, and I don't know if that will ever change. Ultimately, while I certainly don't think I'm the only person in the world that feels that way, considering the potential people from my hometown have always perceived me to have and the incredibly driven educational environment that I'm in now, there will be an incredibly giant spotlight on me if I can't find some motivation in life, flunk out of school, or don't find a well-paying job. While I don't think there's anything wrong with living a simple, average life, the expectations that everyone around me, as well as myself, have always had for me, have been set disastrously high and are leading to my failure.

98,I think I am slowly beating my depression!,"I got severely depressed for about 9 months now. Almost everyday was filled with suicidal thoughts and an incapability of doing things I could do before (even when I was not as severely depressed). One of main issues for me is that I used to be a person who was not too emotional and didn't really have bad days. When I got suicidal thoughts, I just assumed I was over reacting to a bad day rather than actually being depressed. Realizing this among other things was an important part of getting better. I was never able to really put an effort into getting better for 9 months, but I mentally at least wanted to fight a few times which I think was helpful because I never had a stretch of time longer than a month where I didn't want to get better (even if I just wanted to get better for a couple of hours).

The most important thing I figured out recently was what makes me happy. I don't have ambitions like most people and I honestly never did. All I've ever wanted is a fun and pretty girlfriend who I could spend my life with (don't mean this in a desperate way). And to get this, I feel I need to do well in life as well so that I am confident in myself. So right now I'm trying to focus on my education above all things because it is a really important time for my career right now. And weirdly, once I get past the initial hurdle of not understanding wtf is going on in any of my courses, I am able to catch up with things pretty easily. I used to be smart so hopefully these last few years of laziness haven't effected that too much. I am also trying to reduce using my phone before/after going to sleep because I find that it really ruins my sleep. Today was the first day in a while where I slept really well. I think the most important thing in depression is to actual believe you are improving so even if my techniques are completely bogus, they at least seem to be acting as a placebo. 

Thanks for all the help everyone has ever given me here. Being depressed fucking sucks, but it's amazing how all of you still have it in you to help others even if you don't feel the best on most days. If anyone needs some help, you can always PM me. I'll be lurking on this sub anyways (in case things don't actually get better lol), so don't be afraid to post and ask for help no matter how stupid or silly your problems seem compared to someone else's. Just remember that just because you have failed to get out of depression multiple times, doesn't mean it is impossible. Each time you learn something new about yourself and even if we can't see it during the recovery process, eventually you'll see how each failure helped you get better. Best of luck!",1537806687.0
99,I think the real reason I am not able to get out of my depression is because I don't believe there is anything wrong with me other than being lazy.,"When I have a fever or something and am not able to do anything throughout the day I have a reason why I'm sick. But now even though I say that I'm depressed, it really doesn't feel like it. I am not physically restricted in doing anything. Or even mentally restricted in doing anything. From the outside perspective, I have nothing wrong with me other than the fact that I am completely different from the person I was. 

If I have a fever, I rest so that I can get better. And I want to get better as fast as possible and might even fake being better if there is a football game to play or something like that. But with my issues, I feel like I'm lying if I try to be happy if that makes sense. I don't put the same amount of effort to become better as I would in case of having a fever. In case of the fever, it is me vs the fever. Now it is me vs me and it is just weird. I don't want to try to get better because then I've been lying for the past 9 months at least.  There is no evidence that I am anything but a lazy person. I am pretty sure if anyone comments, they are going to tell me that that is how depressed people feel, but I already know that. It doesn't make me feel that my situation is depression though.",1536255327.0

101,Guide to hopefully help with managing depression,"Hey redditors! I decided that it might be helpful to some of you to have some comprehensive advice in one post to help with managing depression. I'll start by giving you my story.

I won't go into too much detail but looking back I realize I started struggling with depression when I was about 15. I hit rock bottom, thought that I fixed the problem, then fell apart again when I moved to a new city alone, living as a neckbeard. It took nearly a decade for me to finally accept and deal with the root of the problem.

So how did I do it? It wasn't easy. Believe me, I know that there is not some magic ""cure all"" and everyone is different. I spent a lot of time reading advice and tried to stick with it but always slipped back. This post is my attempt to share what worked for me, in the most basic possible steps. I also know that this will not work for many people who should consider therapy or medication for a serious illness that cannot be overcome alone.

So, let's get started.

There are two mantras that I will be repeating over and over. The first is that you must do everything in your power to form good habits. A lot of depression is a cycle, that feeling crappy about yourself because you can't even do the simple things, then continuing to not do them because of this so that it gets worse, leading to you feeling worse about yourself. The trick is that, if you can just make it two or three weeks doing something very simple to counter the problem, it becomes a habit and part of your routine. If you can do this then whenever you start to sink again and can only go through the motions, these habits will be a part of it. The second - do everything in your power to think positively. A huge part of this is to never, ever, compare yourself to anyone else. I spent years wondering why other people could do these basic things when I couldn't before I learned to tell myself that even accomplishing ten minutes of cleaning was a step in the right direction. What were trying to do here is very slowly build a positive mental image of ourselves and rebuild self confidence. With that said, let's get into some of the things that need to be done.

**1. Keeping a clean living space.** When it's a struggle to get out of bed in the morning, it can be very hard to keep your place even remotely clean. The trick here is to take the tiniest possible baby steps to **develop the habit**. If all you can do is 10 minutes a day, that is enough to start. Take every bit of inner willpower you have, as impossible it might seem, and spend those 10 minutes washing a few dishes, or picking up and throwing out trash, dusting, anything. When you're done, TAKE PRIDE in what you accomplished, as minuscule as it may seem. After a few weeks you'll find yourself spending that time cleaning without even thinking about it, and before too long your place will start to look nice.

**2. Do your best to stick to a consistent sleep schedule.** Here we have a bit of a conundrum, as one of the symptoms of depression is too much or little sleep. The trick is to set a hard bedtime each night, for example I had a terrible habit of staying up until 3 in the morning reading stupid reddit posts for no reason. I would then sleep late, miss class, and lose out on time to do things that need to be done. To fix this, tell yourself you will be in bed at a time that works for you, say 11:00 PM, and **do not bring electronics into bed with you**. I can't stress enough that not having my laptop or iPad in bed is the sole thing that allowed me to learn to sleep properly, which made me feel much better.

**3. Try your best to get some exercise outside.** The sunlight you'll receive is important, and once you work up to it the endorphins naturally released will make you feel much better. Even if all you can manage is to walk around the block feeling miserable, do it. Again, we're forming a simple habit here and once the habit is ingrained we can try to work on going for a run, hiking, etc and learning to enjoy it.

**4. Eat as well as you can manage.** Another huge one. Being depressed and not wanting to eat or eating crap is another part of the cycle that makes you feel worse, leading to more binge eating or not eating, making you feel even worse. There is a lot of food out there that can be as easy as grabbing a bag of potato chips or getting fast food. Some suggestions:
-frozen peas (you can just eat them straight out of the bag)
-fruits and veggies you can just eat without any cooking (bag of baby carrots, small peppers, cucumbers, bag of salad mix, bananas, oranges, etc - the fruit will help curb sugar cravings as well)
-triscuits (or other somewhat healthy crackers) in place of chips or other junk food
-nuts
-etc
You don't have to do this all at once, just try as hard as you can to replace, say, one snack a day with a healthier option. I got so bad I was just buying fast food almost every meal. I started eating a handful of nuts or crackers and a piece of fruit or vegetable daily. I couldn't even muster the strength to cook, but as I worked my way up I eventually cut out the crap entirely and learned to make some delicious food, and as you progress you'll notice that your body feels better and better.

**5. Try to find a very simple thing you can do to improve someone else's life every day.** One of the things that may have helped me the most was the easiest on this list. Every day driving to school I pass an old homeless man at an intersection with a sign asking for food, money, or anything that might help. I started grabbing just a banana and granola bar before leaving for class every day and giving it to him on my way by. I can't even put into words the look on his face when I stopped a second day, and a third, and didn't stop. I've been doing this for about 6 months, and every day without fail he shakes my hand and thanks me. It might be selfish to say this, but it made me feel great about myself to see what a change I could make in his life. I tell this story so that you realize it doesn't have to be an hour at a soup kitchen or anything, even saying good morning and forcing a smile to someone that looks down will help and after a while you'll realize the smile becomes genuine.

**6. DO NOT TRY TO MAKE SUDDEN OVERHAULS TO YOUR LIFE IN THE MIDST OF SEVERE DEPRESSION.** This is hugely important. For example, if you go on a cleaning rampage and clean everything in one day, you have not **formed the habit** of cleaning regularly, and there is a good chance things will quickly fall apart. If so, you'll probably feel bad about yourself for not being able to stick with it, and be right back at that cycle of depression. Another example - I was a heavy pack a day smoker for years, trying to quit before tackling the other problems failed because I had not *built up the self confidence* to believe I could do it. Failing made me feel like a failure, and I'd be smoking again *and* feel worse about myself.

The takeaway here is that it's important to very, very slowly ingrain these things into your life. Tell yourself this - I want to change. By working towards these tiny steps you will slowly build a core of positive habits that become a part of just going through the motions of your daily life. As things like your living space and health improve you will feel better and though there may still be times that you feel down it will help to counteract that cycle I keep talking about that keeps you down.

Then remind yourself that it's going to be a long, difficult process but **no matter what you can do it**. Even if it takes a couple years, isn't that ultimately better than feeling empty and unfulfilled forever? Believe in yourself. I don't know you but I can guarantee that you are an amazing, beautiful person in your own way and it's vital that you learn to see this for yourself.

I hope that anyone that read this far finds it helpful. If you want to talk to someone that's been there I'm always available, feel free to PM me. If you're thinking about causing harm to yourself, please, talk to anyone, a hotline, friend, family, just do something. Believe it or not I care about you.",1429553906.0

103,A couple of life hacks that have helped me manage lousy moods,"I thought I'd write down a couple of things I discovered on my own, over the course of last 3-4 years. 

1. **Drink plenty of water.**
You know what it's like when a bad mood starts -- a negative ""spark"" thought spirals completely out of control, like a lit match in a pool of gasoline. 
What I've discovered is that drinking ""recommended"" amounts of water helps me stop that fire from spreading. It doesn't prevent those negative thoughts, but it does make me less inclined to follow them to some extreme end. 
Drinking water in a disciplined fashion sounds somewhat nutty, I've got to admit, but it doesn't bother me. It's a small activity that provides a big benefit. I've been at it for about a year, and it definitely doesn't annoy me. That said - it might annoy you, so take this whole thing with a grain of salt :)

2. **Experiment with food.**
I found out that food high in sugar makes my lousy moods much more extreme. Sweets of any kind are pretty bad (cookies, pop, candy), but cake is the worst. I feel good after I eat cake, while I'm on a sugar high. But when that subsides ... boy, it gets pretty awful. A negative ""spark"" thought about 30 minutes after eating cake completely spirals into a monstrosity of negativity. 
For that reason, I now avoid food high in sugar. Over the past 2-3 years, I've subconsciously cut out sugar from my diet. It's now to a point that I don't eat any. 
Like with #1 - not consuming sugar doesn't annoy me. That might be different for you :)

3. **Try to lose yourself in an activity.**
It seems to work best though when I'm ""making"" something, because there's a clear goal in mind. I reckon my mind just doesn't have enough resources to focus on, for example, building an awesome wooden airplane and also to self-criticize me or list my mistakes. 
I have experienced a complete focus on the task at hand during wholly dissimilar activities: wood working, playing video games, computer programming, writing, and running. 

That's all my life hacks. I'm writing them down in the hope that they might help you out. Don't worry about trying out any of these right now - it's worth reading them, so that they're in the back of your mind, and when (sorry to be crude) shit goes real south, I hope hacks like this help you out and make life liveable. Good luck :)",1333760346.0
104,My cats make everything better,"Have been on lexapro for about two months now. Overall, it’s seriously improved my life. I’m finally feeling like me again. But I still get anxiety. These pills might make it much easier to cope, but it doesn’t make it go away completely. And sometimes it’s still difficult to cope. Last night, something dumb triggered me and left me anxious for the night. I got to sleep okay, but woke up with some lingering anxiety. I was scrolling on my phone, and then one of my cats jumped up on my chest. He laid down across my chest and shoulder, right next to my ear. Listening to his purring right in my ear has really calmed me down. I’m still listening to it as I type this.

105,Does anyone else feel guilt or shame over how they made others feel in a past depressive episode?,"I occasionally think back on when I was around 16 or so, and when i finally started to open up about my emotions and mental state.

Doing that now again, after reading something a paramedic wrote after witnessing a father holding his sons body. I just feel so horrible that I wanted to do this to my own parents at one point. I think I’m doing better now, although anxiety is always sky high. After going to therapy and actually being open with the people who care about me things were going really well until the pandemic started, now since my peak in recovery, i guess, idk what to call it; it’s been a slog but I’m fighting through it I believe (besides anxiety).

106,Was exposed to an undetectable HIV positive person. Went on pep not even 24 hours later. My lymph nodes are swollen and now I’m scared shitless.,"So to preface this, I’m not looking to get shamed for my actions. I fucked up, and the last thing I need is people shaming me. 

So about 2 weeks ago, I, a bi guy, had unprotected sex with a guy. In the heat of the moment, my common sense went out the window and I didn’t put on a condom. About an hour later, I was chatting with the dude on Grindr, and he told me he’s HIV positive, yet undetectable. Apparently, it’s almost a 0% chance of transmission if you’re undetectable, but the following day, not even 24 hours later, I went to a sexual health clinic, got all my tests, and was put on post exposure prophylactics. I’ve been taking them daily since July 10th. A few days ago, I started feeling some slight pain in my neck, mostly on the right side. I looked it up, and it turns out HIV can cause swollen lymph nodes. Now I’m freaking out, my anxiety is going up, and I woke up today feeling very low and depressed. I’m very scared. I don’t know what to do. I’m feeling like such a stupid irresponsible piece of shit. Part of me even hopes I have it so that maybe it would kill me. Fuck my life",1595274376.0
107,To the paralegal who made a post titled “can things get better?” then deleted it before I could respond,"I care. I wanted to help. In case you’re out there, here’s what I was going to say. 

———

You want someone to tell you it’s going to be alright, so here I am: it *can* be alright, and I sincerely mean that. Life can always turn around no matter how old you are; Julia Child was around 39 before her life started to take off, to name just one example. 

Things *can* get better and be alright again. This is categorically true. The caveat—which, seeing as how you have depression, I know for a fact you understandably will not want to hear—is that the sole factor in things getting better is you. 

I’m going to tell you two things that every person with anxiety and depression (myself included) doesn’t want to hear, but *needs* to hear in order to get better.

1. No one is coming to save you. I know this is a BRUTAL sentence, but it’s the truth. Absolutely everything that has to do with improving your mental state and your life must be done by you. Other people can only help point you in the right direction. At the end of the day, you urgently need to start practicing (or keep practicing) depending solely on yourself in as many scenarios as possible. We all do, myself included. 

2. *Things* don’t get better; *you* get better. It is far easier and more reliable to change yourself than it is to try to change every single aspect of the world that makes you unhappy. Your behaviors and attitudes are a single, stationary target in comparison to the world, which is a moving target and largely beyond your control. Even if you could completely change your environment to be better, what would happen if you then found yourself in one that was worse? You would fall right back down. By changing yourself instead of the environment, you get to take that positive change *with* you wherever you go. Your improved life will always be with you, because it *is* you. 

If someone had told me these things when I was in my first, deepest depression a few years ago, it would’ve filled me with anguish. I would’ve thought it sounded like a namby-pamby fairy tale that only works for “the happy people” who aren’t depressed like I am. But the truth is that it was philosophies like these that helped dig me out of my shitty life and are still helping me improve my current life. I know that you don’t want to accept this (because your depression has made you jaded and this all sounds like tone-deaf, unrealistic advice), but the only way for you to build a better life for yourself and fix your depression is to fully commit to being a one-person army and digging your own self out of the shit through tenacious, daily effort with zero self-criticism. 

Now: you said in your post that you think your depression is just caused by the utterly shitty circumstances of your life (which, I agree, are terrible. I’m really sorry your life has turned out this way and I don’t doubt your reports of how bad it is for a second) and your last psychiatrist was just throwing medication at you. I sincerely think you’re right about this. Marianne Williamson (the presidential candidate) has said that she thinks psychiatric meds are overprescribed in this country for “normal human despair,” and I agree with her on this. What you’ve been feeling, in my opinion, is completely reasonable DESPAIR over the really shitty lot you’ve been given in life. You’ve already laid it all out for me: you did EVERYTHING you could to get a good life for yourself according to the set of rules you learned growing up (go to college, work hard, go to law school, and so on) and NOTHING is happening for you. You’ve thrown away over a dozen years of your life on a plan that isn’t working, and the worst part is that *it was supposed to work!* It sounds to me like you got totally screwed and it isn’t your fault. It’s hard to imagine a person who wouldn’t be in the depths of despair living under circumstances like yours. 

I don’t think you have a chemical imbalance. I think your spirit has been broken and you’re unable to escape into a better life with your current set of mental tools. 

Here’s what I think you should do. First, look back at the two statements I wrote above, labeled 1 and 2. Turn them over in your mind and see if they make sense to you and if you agree with them; you can only genuinely change yourself if the thing you’re changing yourself into makes more sense to you than what you’re changing out of. 

If they don’t make sense to you, go back to square one. Maybe someone else will help you in some way; I’m sorry I couldn’t be helpful and I hope you get better some way or another. I’d still encourage you to keep the statements in mind, though, because sometimes things take a while to click. 

If they do make sense to you, then consider this third statement from me: 

3. You always have a choice. 

You said you don’t want to become a “numb zombie” who makes peace with a really shitty life they don’t want. Well, here’s the best news you’ll hear all day: you absolutely don’t have to, and you shouldn’t. If you hate your circumstances, you can ALWAYS reject them, and you should. This is self-esteem; if a shitty life has been given to you, then STAND UP, don’t sit down. Accepting a life that you find unacceptable is a TOTAL INSULT TO YOU AS A PERSON. You deserve RESPECT. You get to go out there and seize a better life for yourself regardless of whoever would try to stop you—fuck those people, whoever they are. 

You always have a choice. If you hate your life, find a way to make it better and then patiently, stubbornly commit yourself to that choice. I think there is always a way you can choose your way out of a situation that’s bad for you. Looking back on my own life, I don’t think there was ever a bad situation in which I didn’t have some kind of choice to get out of it or to make it easier in some way. 

Now, shortly after reading your post I was suddenly struck with an idea for you. You say you haven’t been able to get hired anywhere as a lawyer (which is understandable because from what I’ve read it seems like the law field is horribly overcrowded and filled with sharecroppers) and that you’re stuck with your abusive father with no money or savings. To get out of this bad situation and make your life better, it seems to me that you absolutely have to make some kind of choice that will allow you to secure a lawyer position somewhere and get away from your dad. 

While thinking about your post I recalled that the military has its own lawyers. They’re called Judge Advocate Generals and each branch has them. If you have a law degree and are eligible for service (no asthma or other disqualifying conditions), you just join up and go through officer training. 

This would give you a job, clothes, food, a place to live, and a good paycheck that would basically go straight into savings every time because the military would be providing all of your necessities. I’m also pretty sure this wouldn’t be dangerous or related to killing in spite of being a military job. 

So JAG would be a way for you to get a good job, get away from your dad, and build savings, all probably for the price of gas to and from the recruiter’s office and then later a bus ticket to get to officer candidate school. You’d only have to be in the military for four years, and then when you get out you might have better luck getting a job as a lawyer because you’d have four years of experience on your resume—and in a tough military setting to boot. Plus there might be job resources for people getting out of the service. (Absolutely research this instead of taking my word for it.) 

You’re also not too old. I looked at army JAG on the internet and they take people up to 42 years of age. 

Even if you’re not able to do this or you don’t want to, please take it as a demonstration of the fact that you always have a choice. Sometimes the choices you can take are creative things you wouldn’t have otherwise considered, like my JAG example.

112,How the fuck am I supposed to function when I'm constantly being smashed against a curb,"Today I woke up with an overdraft charge of $40 from an automatic charge I didn't authorize in my account and with my independent fasfa filing being rejected. Yesterday the hospital told me to fuck off when I told them my financial circumstance with paying a bill. And I have collections on my ass.

I've been eating rice and granola for a few days now trying to scrape by. My paycheck this Friday is going towards my bank charge and hospital bills. I'll just have to go to a soup kitchen or some shit. Meanwhile the fucking University financial aid office doesn't consider me independent from my parents. That's fucking rich.

 I'm really trying to be positive, but this stuff compounds. I'm still dealing with shitshows from last year. I'm only 21 but another few more years of this and a 30k debt I don't think I'm going to make it.

114,Did anyone grow up with their parents telling them that there’s no such thing as friends and that other people don’t really care about you?,"I’m 25f and I grew up with my mom telling me not to trust anyone. That the friends I had were not real friends and that there is no such thing as friends in the world. I’m realizing now that it’s really impacted my ability to form healthy relationships (romantic and platonic) because when I am getting closer to someone, I start to telling myself that they will never accept me and I distance myself. 

I see others around me forming long lasting, healthy relationships and I just feel so incomplete and broken that I can’t do the same. It just seems so easy for them.

115,I'm 20 years old and I lost 10 grand,"I was new in the investment game and I really didn't know much about investments. I found an investment company on telegram called Bitamax. That already sounds like a Red flag but I was too stupid to understand that. They made me invest 1500 as a limit investment. They next day they told me that my money skyrocketed to 13000. I was so happy but they then told me that I need to put more money in order to take it out. I was skeptical at first but I did it anyway. When I put in 4500 dollars they told me that my profit increased to 3000. I was told to put in more money and the cycle repeated itself until I gave them 10,000. Idk what to do now and my family doesn't know I blew my whole savings. I'm scared that they might find out eventually and it'll be hell on earth when they do. I don't know how I'll recover from this.",1632760316.0
116,"Anyone else hate the ""depressed golden child"" narrative?","First off, no offense meant to anyone who actually does measure up to this narrative; I envy you. 

You've probably heard it in depression awareness videos or articles. The person is, first off, usually pretty conventionally attractive. They have depression and are here to tell you about how they struggled for years feeling hopeless, empty, lost, and alone.

...while somehow managing to act not just normal, but super bubbly and happy so their friends and family never suspected anything was wrong. In high school they were a straight-A honor student, an athlete, and the leader of several clubs. As an adult they hold down a demanding career with long hours, in addition to relationships and maybe even a family. Sometimes there's mention about them being active in a community (fitness, activism, etc) They may or may not have some addiction they turned to to cope with their depression, but it doesn't affect much (at least not in this story). Then it all comes to a head with a suicide attempt or something and now they're here to tell people about depression, the invisible illness.

Look, I don't want to bash high-functioning people. But it's a little hard to not want to, being on the opposite end (or close to it). At times I've looked at stories like these and wondered if I'm just not sick enough? Maybe if I get worse, if I hate myself more, I can become successful too, somehow. Or maybe we should bring back mental health stigma, the pressure to get on with things anyway seemed to work just fine in the past and in modern cultures that don't believe in mental health. 

What's always so bafflingly frustrating about these stories to me is how people are able to do so much with presumably no energy, motivation, or interest. Seriously. How do you even clean out your sink when you're anhedonic, brain-fogged and exhausted? Much less organize a project, write a book, train for a triathlon, all in-between your pre-med classes (yes, I'm exaggerating for effect, but you get the point). I feel like these things can't really be explained by ""going through the motions"" after a certain point; there's got to be some time when ""external pressure"" runs up against a wall. 

Of course I feel like a failure and despise myself in comparison; I know it's only my own fault. But I can still be angry and envious about it.",1617650033.0
117,Grieving over wasted youth due to depression,"How do you cope with the reality if much of your youth (teens and early 20s) was wasted by depression? Those best years of my life were completely wasted with me isolating myself with depression and avoiding others due to social anxiety. In the years that I was the most physically attractive, I wasted the chance to experience college social life, taking pictures with friends, having all of those ""firsts"".

It's not just a matter of trying to have those experiences now in my mid-twenties, it's just a complete loss of my youth. (You older peeps on here can try to convince me I'm still young, but it's truly not the same, that era is lost). I feel so much dread with my age. I'm just old(ish) but have nothing to prove for it.",1604449751.0
118,In this weird period where I'm not severely depressed but I'm not close to being fine either. Feels like I'm stuck in a limbo.,"I was severely depressed and then got used to it/maybe got better and now am not severely depressed. I thought that once I hit this stage all would be much better. It is better objectively, but I have less of a goal anymore. Things are just okay and my ""goals"" are not obvious anymore. 

I also feel very lonely and this keeps reminding me of this girl I really liked when I was depressed. She didn't return the feelings I had for her and it made me feel really hopeless. I felt/feel like I'm lacking as a human being. I have friends but I'm not a nice person anymore. I think I'm unpredictable which really makes people dislike me. I try to change it, but it's tough because I don't know how I can improve myself as a person. 

There are definitely things I can improve on which are kind of ""obvious"". Like improving my programming skills (this is my job), improving my fitness, become more active, but these are things which are generic and kind of tough for me to do because I don't have the basic drive of self improvement. I also think that I might be blaming all my problems on depression which is also holding me back a lot. I haven't accepted my mediocrity, but I always never feel that thing in me which tells me to get my ass out because I have the fallback option of blaming depression. 

I feel that normal people have some sort of drive to change their surroundings in case of unhappiness. Even drug addicts have a drive to go out and hustle to make money to buy drugs. I don't even think I can be a drug addict with my current attitude. Is this something you guys have gone through and if yes, how do you get out of this mindset of being ""fine"" with moderate depression. I want to be an active person. Someone who can make goals and hold himself accountable to get them done.",1592139843.0
119,Have any of you accepted the fact that your life isn't going to be great anymore? Has it made it easier to push on and do your day to day activities?,"I've just started my first job, and I thought I'd finally become a lot better. But instead, on most days I wake up groggy and generally can't communicate that well or learn that fast. I feel lonely and honestly, I can't say that I have anything I look forward to. There are bursts of energy, where things look good and my mind is active, but they don't last for longer than a few hours.

I feel that there is no true purpose of living, but most people have reasons to live in terms of relationships at least. But for me, I'm scared to talk to any of my friends. I get really anxious when I text people or when they text me. I also feel that I'm really ugly and would be worthless as a boyfriend because of my mental issues. 

If I'm not desirable as a friend, too ugly to be a boyfriend of someone, not smart enough most of the time, what do I really have to look forward to? I can't imagine a life past my depression at this point. It has become a part of me which alienates me from others. Should I accept my fate? How do I begin to reconcile with the fact that I'll never have friends, be smart or have a normal life like most people out there? Should I consider ending it if things don't get better?",1566146987.0
120,A simple exercise to improve your sense of self-esteem,"Hi reddit :) Today, I found this little exercise by the Danish Mental Health Fund that I thought you might like. You can see it [here in Danish](http://www.psykiatrifonden.dk/Forside/Projekter/Landsindsatsen+om+Depression/Mere+om+depression/R%C3%A5d+til+dig+der+har+en+depression/Selvv%C3%A6rd+-+det+psykiske+immunforsvar); I've translated it as best I can: 

>Your sense of self-esteem grows when you do something you can be happy about and proud of. Everybody benefits from increasing their self-esteem, and this is one method to do so:  
>
>* Make a list of ten general, good qualities that you appreciate, e.g. setting clear boundaries, keeping one's word, being a good friend. 
>* Measure how convinced you are that you have the individual qualities (0-100%)
>* Choose a quality where you have a low conviction, and describe in detail where, when and how you practiced this good quality. Use actual situations as examples. 
>* Now measure again how convinced you are that you have this quality. 
>
>This exercise uses the cognitive learning principles. You turn your attention to qualities that you can be proud of and happy about. Then you decide on the value of the individual quality, the subjective value that you place on the skill, ability or quality. Then you develop the quality by focusing your attention on what it's like to have that quality, and finally you realise that the quality you are turning your attention to, is growing in you and becoming more present. 
>
>The most important thing is to practice having that good quality every day. When you make sure that your active repertoire and the skills you usually use, are full of good qualities, you will build a personal identity full of good qualities, and you will develop and maintain your self-esteem. You can maintain your fokus on building self-esteem by asking yourself questions like: 
>
>* Are my thoughts combined with positive expectations? 
>* Are my thoughts reinforcing my courage? 
>* Are my thoughts about myself reflecting my self respect and care for myself? 
>
>If the answer is no, you must use the exercise to change your thoughts, so you can answer yes instead.

I hope this can help you - I know I'm going to try it :)",1322207117.0

I saw this post on Instagram about a cozy spot someone made, and it made me realize that it’s like my brain is unable to experience these feelings anymore. For example, I remember when I was young, on rainy days, I’d just get all cozy with a book and a coffee and felt so cozy and warm. Now, I don’t feel that feeling, even if I’m doing the same thing. I’m wondering if it’s depression. I do have a hard time experiencing pleasure in my hobbies and through music, so I’m wondering if it’s the same thing. How can I get over this?

123,"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

124,Free and easy to use mental health resources I’ve found useful,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety.",1604514107.0

126,[Update - 1 year later] I did it. I was genuinely happy today for a full 24 hours.,"Around a year ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/9a5pj1/i_did_it_i_was_genuinely_happy_today_for_a_full/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

I've come back to say I'm still going strong. There have been minor relapses - but with each day my hope in and love for life and myself grows.

I no longer need antidepressants. I have a social and romantic life, and many relationships to maintain. Work is steady and successful. I have enjoyable hobbies and passions and dreams that I work towards. I've become physically healthier and more fit.

But life is not easier, not really. My circumstances have not changed much. Many of the relationships I maintain now were the ones that nearly killed me 4 years ago. Even as I post this, I am at risk of a severe illness. 

But I'm not hopeless, or resentful, that this would happen just as I began to love life again. I am grateful to have lived - to have survived to this moment where I am proud to say I am who I am, and to have learned to love living again. I'm stronger, and livelier, and I'm the healthiest and most emotionally developed I've ever been. Those people or bad relationships can't hurt me anymore.

Many mornings and evenings I walk alone at the shoreline where I live. Back in the day I was always alone and hated it. I would say out loud, ""I want to live."" I used to say that to try to convince myself I believed it. But today I walk alone because my own company is what I crave the most - and I say I want to live because I truly feel it, I feel it so much I want to shout it.

I don't foresee depression coming back into my life like it did before. Anxiety about breakups, job loss, rejection, and abuse consumed me back then, but these days I seek out the difficult path - the tough outcomes. I thrive in them. But nothing is for certain, not even this recovery. And yet I'm glad. Adversity makes for the best stories, right?

Thanks all for listening. I urge you to continue to fight. Fight for yourself even if no one else will. No one fought for me - and yet here I am. 

The slow walk you will take on some sunlit morning, when you realize you want to live, is one of the best moments human life has to offer us.

129,"For anyone “coping well” with depression/anxiety/trauma/etc, do bad days/breakdowns still catch you off guard?","Recently, it hit me that I’ve been depressed/suicidal for most of my entire life. I found a note from my then best friend when I was still in school asking me “what’s with your obsession with suicide?” I’ve also been diagnosed with anxiety after people close to me passed away/were on deaths bed. It doesn’t help that it runs in my family genetics as well.

It took me way… way too long, but I finally found meds that worked for me, got out of a toxic workplace and long-term relationship, started eating better and exercising regularly. I only see my psychiatrist once a year to refill my meds and a therapist once a month or so when I feel I’m burning out/not taking better care of myself.

I thought recovering from my mental illnesses would mean that I’d be free from the self hate/doubt/loathing that plagued my everyday and night. Well, I had hoped it would. Some days, like today, I breakdown because I’ve stretched myself too thin, pushed myself too hard for too long, and it feels like everything I thought I graduated from, comes flooding right back. Granted, these episodes come less frequently than before. It’s easier to pick myself up after a breakdown. But it still feels like the wind is knocked out of my soul when it happens.

130,"Yes, focusing on your breath is boring - but giving yourself a break from stimulation is important for your mental health","I was getting ready to do a presentation in front of a crowd of people recently and was ""bricking it"" as we say back home. I've had a lifelong fear of public speaking - I sat there in my seat waiting to be called, all of the things that could go wrong passing through my mind when I remembered Thich Nhat Hanh's words: “Breathing in, I arrive in my body.” And after some mindful breaths, I was back - back in the present moment, back from the catastrophic future that I has created in my head. 

 All of us breathe, its something we do all the time, so it’s a very powerful link to the present moment. And the present moment is the only place where we can be happy. We’re not happy when we’re worrying about the future, we’re not happy when we’re regretting the past. Breathing is our anchor to the here and now, its something we can turn to at any moment when we’re feeling stressed or angry or sad. In the practice we call this returning to the breath and we train ourselves to do this when things are going well, no big emergencies so that when a pipe bursts in the house or we have to speak in front of a crowd of people we can reduce the impact that difficult emotions have on us. The breath is an opportunity for us to stop, let go of the future and past, return to the present moment and notice all of the different dimensions of our breathing. 

 Why is breathing so important and why does it work? Returning to the breath calms us, allows us to take a step back and observe how we’re feeling rather than being swept away. The breath might seem boring, mundane - but an important part of the practice of mindfulness is to focus on the everyday and take joy from simply being alive. The key thing to remember is that its focusing our awareness on the breath, rather than the breath itself, that liberates us. Focusing on the steadiness, the repetitiveness of the breath gives us a break from constant stimulation of work, TV, the kids and most of all ourselves and our own thoughts; it allows our mind to settle. When we let our mind settle it becomes calm, calmness leads to insight into our suffering. Letting go of suffering leads us to peace; when we’re peaceful we’re more compassionate and compassion creates a kinder world. And it all starts with your breath in this moment.

131,Realised (once again) that depression leads to other problems which you need to deal with as well.,"Because of my depression, I had a lot of other problems. For one, I never paid attention in college. Across the 4 years. Don't remember much of what I learned there at all so even though I went to a really good college, my quality was that of a not so good student. The other thing is that my depression really affects my consistency and though I can be good for short periods of time, in the long run (3-4 months), people will beat me easily. This is true at work as well as hobbies. I think that's the main thing I've realised in the past couple of weeks.

I need to let go of my ego that I'm better than people because it's really affecting me everyday. I find it tough to accept someone else's achievements especially if they do something better than me in something I care about a lot. I would say that letting go of my ego is the most important thing I need to work on. Interesting, I feel like I also need to improve my self worth at the same time. I know these are conflicting things, but I feel that it's good to feel some positive about yourself and improving yourself is the best way to do that.

I'm going to do the following from today onwards:

* Focus on work a lot during my work hours. I usually spend time doing nothing because I can eventually complete things in much less time than given. It's decent work but I've been slacking off for the past 3-4 months. I'm going to focus on getting shit done. 
* Focus on improving my skills which I keep talking about. I want to be better at programming and am going to focus on competitive programming because I feel thats a good way to game the system as well.
* Focus on living in the present. Work to make today happy instead of trying to think too far into the future because that only brings sadness to me.
* Don't compare yourself with others. Compare yourself with what you were yesterday because that's the best you can do. Otherwise you will keep comparing yourself with others and will be forever sad because there's always someone that's going to be better than you. Lose your ego and try to absorb from these people rather than trying to be better than them.",1597505408.0
132,"My take on battling depression after being daily on reddit, quora and pills for several months.","Dear all,

I  might come as showing off, but I have to write this, because I owe a lot to people on reddit, who replied to my cries of desperation few months ago. More so now, with Corona waking up depression in many of us, I want to make a **summary of what I've gathered and what get me out of that shit**.

It is a strategy inspired by many others on this sub and elsewhere, but please don't think about it as a full proof remedy - I only know it helped me and I felt, that I am obliged to share my story.

Ok, so shortly about my situation - I was not happy with my life and didn't know where I am going and why. Stupid as I was, I took a lot of LSD to awaken something me. I did. I was depressed for four months. But now, in retrospective, I am actually really happy, that I took those tabs, because it changed my life for the better after all.

So  in August I was lying in my bed at my parents place, staring at the  ceiling, having suicidal thoughts, being jobless and being so, so hateful towards myself, feeling guilty of everything, feeling like a  useless burden for all my relatives and friends. You know what I mean..

Now I have three great jobs, living in my own apartment, developing hobbies and I feel sense and happiness in the things I pursue.

What helped me? Stupid, the most cliché things and advices you can find out  there. But really, they help. IN A LONG RUNG. Don't expect it to help  you in a day, or a week, or a month. It takes time and you have to fight  every day not to fall into those dark depth of your shattered soul.

1. Create a prehistoric **task manager**  \- take a piece of paper every evening and write three, four tasks for tomorrow, you can handle. It can be - short walk around a bloc, do ten push-ups, take a shower. You know, step by step. It can be just getting out of bed in the first days, but there has to be a task. And now the important thing - make a fat nice tick next to the task, once you  complete it. it sounds so stupid, I know, but this can boost your motivation so much - yes, a simple tick, once you complete a task. When you see after a week, that three tasks per day changed to six and that  every one of them has a juicy tick next to them, you will feel something  remotely related to happiness, to satisfaction.
2. This task manager is the first step to make some **routine**.  You have to have routine. And it's not easy to make one. Maybe you  won't succeed to create this routine in one week, but that's okay! It's  hard for everyone. But strengthening your routine will strengthen everything else. So make those tasks like doing ten push ups a new  habit, a routine, not just one day task. After several weeks, you won't  have to even write it down, because it will just became part of you,  your ritual. Our ancestors knew why they were going through rituals -  it's fricking good for your mental health.
3. Speaking about push ups - I know it's hard even to get up out of bed, but your  body and mind are connected more than you think - and that body needs  some movement to aid your prime target - and that's the hard struggle  within your mind. **Move the body**  and you will soon move your spirit up, not down. For me, Yoga was the  best choice and I can't imagine a day without several Salutes to the Sun  now.
4. **Cut the connection to people, who makes you feel guilty, or inferior.**  Yes, you think it's your mistake, that you feel that way, and that those guys are really cool, and great and sooo kind that they spend time with you. NO. If you don't feel good around them, try everything to get away from them for now. Once you are okay, lets meet them again. if they are not complete idiots, they will understand. I know this can be  very hard, if such people are your relatives or closed ones, but now you  are fighting for your life, so try everything you can to be around loved ones, who are tolerant, kind and 100% there for you without any  insensitive jokes, stares etc.
5. If you have a **pet or pets**, pet them. Intensively. Daily.
6. Most importantly - don't be afraid to **share**.  There is lot of individualism deeply rooted in western society. It is wrong, dangerous concept. There is nothing dignified about being  reclusive, silent, battling that bitch on your own. It is not brave to not talk about your troubles, it's stupid, selfish and dangerous. Share it. With other people here on reddit, with a health professional, your mum, your friends, your dog, whoever. If you now find the courage to share the bad and unpleasant things you are dealing with, I guarantee you, that in several months you will share great, engaging ideas, you will share an atmosphere of mutual understanding and people will feel good around you and you will feel good around them.

Also, don't look to your phone every three minutes.. **crocheting** is really therapeutic though and lot of fun :)

Good luck, you are a beautiful being and you can blossom in this world. Keep fighting.

133,"Forming a new identity after years of dysthymia, apathy, and depression","Hi everyone,

I'm 21 years old and since I was a young teenager I have had dysthymia and occasional bouts of depression. I don't want to go into details, but I feel like I have been living permanently inside my head, crippled by severe apathy, social anxiety, eating disorders and feeling like I don't deserve to happy. Although I'm nowhere near completely ""over it"", I've been taking antidepressants and going through therapy for the past few months, meaning that I am slowly starting to realise that life doesn't have to be as miserable as it has been for me. 

That being said, leaving my depression behind feels really scary. I feel that I am losing a part of myself, so to speak. When people normally talk about recovering from depression, they mention returning to their old self; regaining interest in things they once loved and reconnecting with those who care about them. I, however, feel like I have no ""old self"" to go back to. 

Without my depression, I feel like I have no identity. For the past few years I feel like I have done nothing but sleep, eat, drag my way through school, and desperately try to gain approval from people. I have no real passions or interests and I genuinely have no friends. I feel like I don't really know myself at all. I have nobody outside my family who cares for me. I have never had real friends or romantic relationships, and frankly, I am terrified of them. I don't know how to be the ""real"" me, because all I have ever known is depression. 

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Right now I am trying to get into a few things that I find even a little bit interesting, exercising, and generally trying to taking care of myself. In some ways it feels like staying depressed is the easier option - when everything in life is pointless and boring, life doesn't feel so overwhelming, as weird as it sounds. I feel like the world has opened up and there are lots of possibilities because I am still young, but instead of being hopeful, I am terrified. Depression has been safety blanket and the lens through which I have viewed the world for so long, and without it, I feel lost. 

 If anyone has any suggestions for me, I'd be so grateful. Thank you.",1581937740.0

Without getting into too much detail, I'm tired of putting on a happy face and forcing being a ""good daughter"" to my parents when they directly caused a traumatic incident in my life about a year ago, then gaslighted me for several months about what happened. A psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD relating to the incident. My parents haven't given me a real apology or explanation. They're just expecting me to move on with life like everything's cool.

""Oh, you experienced trauma and now endure complex, dark feelings based on something WE directly caused? Get over it. Your feelings aren't our problem."" This is how it feels they're treating me.

I've had it told to me that I'm ""too nice,"" ""a pushover,"" etc. I'm scared to death of pissing people off and endangering relationships, so I bend over backward to give other people what they want. I'm a fucking doormat that people take advantage of.

I feel stuck in this dark mindset. My relationship with my parents never gets better. None of my romantic relationships progress as I want them to. I feel like I'm trying so hard to do the ""right"" thing, but I get fucked over anyway.

And in the past couple of years I've had a lot of toxic friendships that have turned very sour in the end so I've had a hard time navigating my relationships.

I've been really stressed out due to being trapped inside because of all this, especially since I didnt interact with my flatmate all that much before and I don't know her that well. She has been coming on very strong since the lockdown started, and while she's a lovely person, I haven't been able to tell her that I really need my own space and the obligation to interact has been tough to deal with, especially since my last flatmate situation ended very badly and I haven't wanted to get close to her because of that - so that combined with my need for privacy and space has been hard to deal with.

So I told her today that her constantly calling me when we're in our own rooms and sort of pressuring me to interact 24/7 has been making me anxious and she took it so well and she was so supportive. We've been having movie nights, which I can handle much better since we don't need to talk while watching something and we decided to keep doing stuff like that while toning down with e.g. going on walks where I feel anxious to keep the conversation going and I feel like I cant escape.

So yeah. When she responded to me being all supportive I just straight up started crying. I'm not used to kindness and people respecting or accepting my boundaries.

Physique, social/love life, creative quality and skill, money....Everyone seems better than me, but everyone seems to love what I make and do, but all my ""accomplishments"" just look like shit to me, and I can't buy the idea to stop and enjoy life when I have to commit to fixing everything to feel like I belong.

I also am experiencing panic and anxiety attacks and self-guilt whenever I'm at my apartment.

I've been in a dark place since 2013. Dark and getting darker. I have an awesome job, awesome kids, wonderful friends, an amazing doggo, a beautiful apartment. But none of that mattered. I existed out of sheer obligation. A month ago, I could barely get out of bed. Drank myself into oblivion every night. I couldn't cook, couldn't clean. Nothing was fun anymore. I drank and slept til it was time to go to work again, and on the worst days tried to pretend I was sick. I was probably close to losing my job. 

I finally had enough. I wanted to live, but I just didn't know how. I found a great doc, who sat me down, looked at my laundry list of complaints. Then she looked me in the eye, and she said ""I'm going to help you. We're going to get you better.""

For the first time in 3 years, I felt hope. It was such an alien feeling, but it was good.  She started me on an anxiety medication, and I had my doubts. I'd tried it before when I was younger with no effect. But I trusted her, and I was willing to try anything.

A month later, I'm drinking far less, close to being able to quit for good. I've lost weight. And I feel almost all the way alive again. I've been able to do things. I just...feel. I think that's the difference. I finally notice how much life there is to live.

This is a work in progress so please let me know your thoughts and how to improve it. It’s probably my most ambitious work so it needs a lot of help. 

**Step One: Understand What Depression Is**

The first step in battling depression is understanding what depression is. Depression is fundamentally a chemical imbalance in your brain. Your brain releases chemicals that make you feel good (dopamine, serotonin, etc...) and chemicals that make you feel bad. Depression is simply when you have too much of the bad chemicals. 

Why do some people have too much of the bad chemical? Science does not know for sure. Some severely depressed people believe that the chemical imbalance is solely caused by genetics or other things they can’t control. That might be true to an extent, but I believe that at least part of your depression is caused by things you have control over: your thoughts and your actions. Even though depression is fundamentally a chemical imbalance, we can do things to change the chemicals in our brain. In this article I will focus on things that you can change – there is no use of fretting over things you can’t change.

Here is my slightly scientific guess of what causes depression:

Depression, like all emotions in human beings, has an evolutionary reason. Humans evolved to feel good when we do something good (i.e., ate healthy food, or make love to a beautiful woman) and to feel bad when we fuck up so that we don’t fuck up again. When something bad happens and we become depressed, our emotions dry up and we ruminate because we are programmed to put everything to the side and just think to figure out what we did wrong. Scientists have identified different types of depression for different types of fucking up –rejection depression happens when somebody we care about rejects us (i.e., a break up): we lose our appetite and can’t sleep because we literally think we are in the woods alone. There is also a type of depression where we feel useless to society so we just want to die – evolutionary, it makes sense for the useless members of the tribe to just die. 

Depression is so destructive in human beings because those evolutionary emotions don’t correspond to reality and therefore don’t help us in the real, modern world. Usually they hurt us. For example, we may FEEL like we “fucked up” when we really haven’t or feel like we are useless when we are not. Our parents, friends or teachers may make us think that we “fucked up” if we didn’t get a job that pays $100,000 a year. In reality that’s dumb - you can be perfectly happy without $100,000 a year, but if you’re convinced you fucked up then the depression emotions kick in. The reason depression is sometimes called a “chemical imbalance” is because we have too much of the bad chemical even though nothing bad actually happened.

Rumination also doesn’t help if we don’t have all of the necessary information. If your girlfriend dumps you, you may ruminate endlessly to figure out why (BTW, this is why guys want “closure” so much – who gives a shit about closure when the relationship is over?). But rumination is useless because you can’t read her mind so you will never really know why she dumped you. Maybe she was cheating on you and you never did anything wrong. Maybe she never liked you in the first place. Maybe she’s just crazy. Even if you did figure it out, that rumination is useless because you need to move on anyway. Ruminating on something without adequate information is like a hamster running on a wheel – you will never get anywhere.

The real danger of depression is confabulation. Confabulation is when our emotions hijack our rational thought processes, so we THINK we are being rational but we are really just justifying our emotions. A recovering alcoholic will come up with a brilliant argument to justify why he should have JUST ONE DRINK. He may think he is being rational and logical, but really he is just being tricked by his emotions that want alcohol.

Depression confabulates negative thoughts in our head. If you get dumped, you may think to yourself “I will never find somebody else again.” Of course, that’s totally irrational – you can definitely find somebody else again. That thought is your depression hijacking your mind. 

Here is why depression is super fucked up: let’s say you are depressed for 5 years. In that 5 years you will think a lot – but many times when you have a thought your depression will hijack your rational brain and make you think something negative rather than the rational thing. After hundreds of thousands of thought cycles, your brain will be now filled with negative thoughts about how much you fucked up and will never succeed and those negative, terrible thoughts will be reinforced and backed up with negative emotions. Those negative thoughts and emotions will then lead to more negative thoughts and emotions and you will form whole belief patterns and ideologies based on those negative thought processes, and those negative patterns will entrench themselves deeply into your neural networks and habits. A lot of times when you meet really unsuccessful people or people from the ghetto you will see that they have deeply entrenched negative belief systems. 

That is why depression is such a miserable pit for people to climb out of – they are literally buried under piles and piles of negative emotions and limiting beliefs. That’s why it takes a lot of time and work to pull yourself out of depression and clear away those emotions and thoughts. To make matters worse, those negative emotions make us feel “comfortable” and even though they are harmful to us, we feel even worse when we try to be confident or ambitious.

Worse yet, humans beings are designed to be excellent at focusing. That’s why we have had so many great artists and scientists throughout human history – we have a tendency to get obsessed with something and block out the rest of the world. However, when that thing is bad, we may lose sight of the bigger picture and just focus on the one bad thing that happened. People that are depressed often get obsessed with their failures and forget about all the good things in their life and the positive possibilities.

**Step Two: Change Your Thinking**

I believe that to defeat depression, one must look at the world in a fundamentally new way. Our beliefs about reality, the meaning of life, and our future are crucial in determining how happy we are. 

**Assume all unknown information is positive**

You have 3 types of information in your brain: good things that are going on in your life, bad things that are going on in your life, and things that you are still uncertain of because you don’t have enough information. If a good thing happens to you, you feel good because of evolution. If a bad thing happens to you (i.e., you get fired from your job), you feel bad because of evolution. However, evolution never figured out how to handle uncertainty – how do you feel when you don’t have enough information to figure out whether it is bad or good? Well, a depressed person just defaults to negative. If they don’t something, they just assume it’s bad. 

This is incredibly harmful because 99% of the information that is relevant to your life is uncertain. You just don’t know what your future holds. You don’t know what people really think about you, how much your skills stack up to others, what luck you will have, etc... Life is just full of uncertainty. Depression takes all this uncertain information and just assumes it is negative. You just had an interview? You’re probably not good enough to get it. You want to approach a girl? She’s probably out of your league. “Negative” is the default for depression. 

To fight depression, you must assume that all the uncertain facts are positive. You absolutely must believe that everything will be awesome, the universe loves you, you can succeed at anything you try, any girl will fuck you, and you will be happy beyond your wildest dreams. You’ve never acted in a movie? Doesn’t matter, you still might win an Oscar this year. I’ll be honest: this is a little delusional. Some of those uncertain facts may end up being negative for you. But you shouldn’t worry about that until you get there and you KNOW they are negative. As long as you don’t know, you MUST assume the facts are positive for you. That girl you’ve never talked to? She probably really likes you. That interview you just did? You’re probably going to get it. Go to the extreme: you need to think that literally anything is possible, you might become a billionaire tomorrow, the rules of the world do not apply to you, and God will love you and give you whatever you want. Of course, don’t make decisions based on irrational positivity, but use the irrational positivity to motivate you. 

You may object and say “I can’t fix depression with being delusional.” First of all, yes you can. Studies have shown that feeding people delusional thoughts can make them happier – even when they know it’s fake! In fact, if somebody did something wrong to you, you can make yourself feel better by writing a fake letter from them to you apologizing and reading it to yourself every day for a week. Your rational brain may know you are lying to yourself, but your emotions don’t. The same way depression can irrationally trick your emotions into feeling bad, you can irrationally trick your emotions into feeling good. Second, you’re not really being delusional: you’re just making positive assumptions about facts you don’t know. It’s not technically wrong and this type of optimism is helpful. In fact, it is the basis for most religion. No human being knows whether or not God actually exists or whether he actually loves us or whatever, but people believe that and feel better. It works! Thinking negatively is usually bad for you unless you are working on fixing a specific thing that you are doing wrong. 

Please also keep in mind that depression is causing you to irrationally think negatively, so you need to counterbalance that somehow. Some people think overly positively and are naïve. That’s bad as well, but depression is the opposite problem. If your view of reality is warped to be negative you need to balance it out. 

To think positively you need a daily routine. This could be many things: reading inspirational stuff, listening to music, praying, chanting, meditation, affirmations, self-talk. Whatever. You should also engage in meta-cognition (thinking about your thoughts). Let’s say you have a negative belief: next time it pops into your head, analyze it logically. Is it backed up by facts or did your depression just convince you it was true? Are you afraid of getting fired? Why? Are you obsessing over some small fact?

Whenever something bad happens, figure out why it happened and how you can prevent it in the future. If it is something you can’t control, you need to figure out how to accept it. If you made a mistake, figure out what you did wrong and don’t do it again. Try to learn something from every failure. And then, move on and don’t let it make you feel shitty anymore. And don’t let that one negative thing infect the rest of your thinking and make you think your world is crashing down around you. 

**Give up on the life you wanted or thought you deserved**

This is going to sound weird, so bear with me here.

It’s a huge oversimplification, but you can generally characterize depression or happiness with this formula: Happiness = Where you are – where you think you should be. If where you are is greater than where you think should be, then you will be happy. That is why gratitude is so important for happiness – people literally feel like they lucked out in life, so they feel good. If, however, where you are is LESS than where you think you should be, then you will feel depressed. In other words, you have a fake image of what you should have accomplished and you will feel like you “fucked up” because you aren’t there yet. This is the main thing I hear when I talk to depressed people.

Part of the reason so many people in our society are depressed is that pop culture and the media keep feeding us images of what we should have and be. Everybody feels like they should have a huge house, an awesome career, a beautiful family, a nice car, vacations in the tropics, etc... And when they don’t have these things they feel depressed.

The key to being happy is detaching yourself from all of those external things and just being happy with what you have. You are a piece of dust moving through the universe and the only thing you can do is the right thing at every moment. You can’t focus on the big picture all the time – just do what you know you need to do right now. Focus on putting one foot in front of the other. Not only is that the right thing to do – it is the ONLY thing you can do. Obsessing over all the things you want or are supposed to have will only bring misery. This is going to be very difficult for most people because we are ingrained with certain values and goals from an early age and it will take a huge shift in thinking to abandon those things. But you have to remember that humans are frail beings and nobody has figured out what a “happy” life is and they certainly haven’t figured out what YOUR happy life is. Everybody is born into a different situation and it takes a weird combination of hard work, luck, a head start, and a certain personality type to end up at any particular point. And anything you accomplish can disappear in a second because reality is a cruel motherfucker. We are all on a different journey and for some of us, our journey will not lead to the lifestyles of the rich and famous. That’s ok – life isn’t about impressing anybody or achieving some pre-set goal some asshole you never met made up for you. Just be happy. 

Give up on where you think you should be and just enjoy your day to day life. Stop thinking about being a rock star or a billionaire and just focus on being a good person, doing a good job today, and enjoying lunch. The little things in life should make you happy. The big things are great, but you shouldn’t have an emotional attachment to them and you definitely shouldn’t feel bad because you are not there yet. Life is all about little steps: you have to put one foot ahead of the other, and you will eventually make it. 

We live in a society that is obsessed with goals, but I think it is stupid and unhealthy to form an irrational emotional attachment to a goal that you may not be able to achieve or may not be right for you. I have been doing stand up comedy for 6 years now and I have run into a lot of people that should quit because they just are not good enough and never will be. These people are depressed and miserable because they have this image in their head of what their life should be, and fail to recognize that happiness is a day to day thing and even if you do “make it” you will find some other reason to be unhappy.

Don’t get me wrong: I think people should have goals and work hard: I am not saying give up on life or be lazy. The last thing you should do is smoke pot and watch TV all day. But your goals should be in the back of your mind and they shouldn’t emotionally dominate you or overwhelm you. At any given point, you should be thinking about what you are doing at moment rather than your far off goals. 

Ever since I started thinking like this, I have been much more successful, because instead of having my head in the clouds, I got down to business and did the hard day to day work that nobody wants to do or even talk about. 

**Realize that depression is an irrational emotion and does not represent reality**

Now that you know that depression is essentially a mix of chemicals that make you feel bad even though you don’t deserve it, you can slowly start rebooting those negative thoughts and feelings you have. The next time a voice in your head tells you something negative, realize that the voice is not “you” but rather a chemical that is lying to you to make you feel like shit. Let’s say you’ve always thought of yourself as bad with girls. Next time that thought or feeling pops into your head, analyze it rationally: are you really bad with girls? Or do you just think you are, and is that thought fucking you up? Maybe your failure with girls is based on some small thing you can easily fix? Or maybe you just think “I suck at girls” and have used that thought as an excuse to not get better. Meta cognition is extremely important and is one of the reasons you need to bring in outside people who can view you objectively to help you get better. 

The cascade of negative thoughts that comes with depression can sometimes even convince you that reality has consciousness and favors other people instead of you. This is one of those beliefs you need to logically analyze and realize is bullshit. Reality, to the best anybody can tell, is just a series of logical rules that doesn’t give a flying fuck about anybody. The President can die of a heart attack tomorrow and a homeless guy can win the lottery and become richer than Donald Trump. You can either fear reality and be intimidated by it, or just see it as a tool that you can use to achieve happiness. If you absolutely want to believe that reality has consciousness, go ahead, but why not assume that it loves you and wants you to be the king of the world?

**Be suspicious of all of your emotions**

That insane cascade of negative thoughts and emotions can affect any one of your emotions, so beware. Let’s say you are having “oneitis” for a girl. Try some meta-cognition: do you really “love” that girl or is your depression convincing you that you need her? Let’s say you hate somebody and want to get revenge on them – think about logically: is it worth your time and mental energy to pursue a vindictive grudge against them or is your depression causing that? Let’s say there is somebody abusive in your life – do you actually need that person in your life or is your depression making you feel like you need them?

**Step Three: Fix your day to day life**

Positive thoughts are great, but at the end of the day you need to reverse the flow of shitty chemicals in your brain and the only way you can do that is through action. You need “wins” – things you succeed at. These wins will boost your dopamine in a healthy way and fight those shitty networks created by depression. 

**Tackle your problems head-on** The only way you can solve your depression is if you tackle your problems head-on. There are a lot of ideologies that advocate “not caring” or “disconnecting” yourself from reality – they don’t work. You need to engage in reality and get some “wins.” You can’t just give up and accept defeat – that won’t make you feel better. There is nothing wrong with practicing stoicism or Buddhism to make yourself feel better, but at the end of the day you still need to figure out a way to solve your problems and you need “wins.” Only after you start consistently getting wins will you be happy.  

**Get help** Get therapy if you need it. Find yourself positive friends that will help you get better. Ditch people that are negative influences, especially people who don’t understand depression or just tell you to “snap out of it.” Find yourself a role model that you want to be like so you can work towards being like them. Find yourself a mentor that will give you advice to achieve your goals. Find positive places on the internet that will help you improve. You need objective voices that aren’t buried under the same avalanche of negative thoughts and emotions you are and then YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THEM. Your negative thoughts will try to ignore them but you need to be open minded and listen to them even if they sound crazy. And of course, stay away from other depressed or negative or shitty people. Don’t be ashamed to get help!

**Succeed in a practice** A practice is an activity that you actually get better at and can produce tangible results. Painting, cooking, Crossfit, bodybuilding, stand up comedy, and getting good at your job are all practices. Watching movies, being a “foodie,” and playing video games are not practices. There is nothing wrong with those things, but they won’t pull you out of depression. Practices have objective standards that you need to meet to be successful and once you meet those standards you will feel good because you conquered something. I believe that engaging in a practice is the best way to happiness because it gives you those “wins” you need to feel happy.

**Adopt small goals** Maybe you can’t decide on a practice to pursue or feel intimidated by the difficulty of the practice that you engage in. Your depression may say to you “there is no way you’ll ever be successful at this so don’t even try.” Start off with giving yourself incredibly tiny goals that you definitely know you can achieve – then when you achieve those goals you get a small “win.” When I was in the depth of my depression, my goal was to just brush my teeth every day. Everything after that in the day was a bonus. I know that sounds absurd, but it gave my life meaning and purpose and made me feel better. After that became a routine, I then moved to slightly bigger goals. Even today, when I am feeling overwhelmed with work, I will set a tiny goal for myself – all I need to do today is X and then I can go home. Right now, you can instantly boost your self-esteem by focusing on one small thing in your life. You can promise to yourself “my hair will look awesome every day” or “I will stop making X mistake at work.” Even those little things will make you feel better. 

**Do the regular things you know stop depression** You’ve seen them a million times other places, but I will just list them again: go to the gym, eat better, get enough sleep, do things that help you relax, do something spiritual, stimulate yourself intellectually, eliminate shitty things from your life. Etc...

**Beware of cheap happiness** “Cheap happiness” is anything that makes you feel good but is ultimately not beneficial for you or even may be bad. This includes drugs, women, porn, speeding, wasting time on the internet, watching TV, playing video games, etc... While there is nothing normally wrong with a little bit of cheap happiness, depressed people are prone to become addicted because they are miserable and these things make them feel good, even if it is for a fleeting moment. A lot of depressed people try to “escape” their problems with cheap happiness, only to come back and realize that the problem has only gotten worse since they left reality. Just as depression creates negative neural pathways in your brain, feeding yourself cheap happiness when nothing else is making you happy will re-wire your brain to rely on these things for happiness

**Adopt a routine and a strict schedule** This is probably the most important thing on this list. You need a routine and a strict schedule. If you read famous people’s biographies you will notice that they all had strict schedules. This is because depression, laziness, and “cheap happiness” are evil monsters lurking in the back of your head constantly ready to get you, whether or not you have depression. If you don’t create absolutely strict boundaries for yourself, you can easily find yourself lost in a Wikipedia spiral or worse a drug or porn binge. The only way you can ward these monsters off is to set aside a chunk of time when you are absolutely committed to doing your work or engaging in your practice. Even if you are too depressed to actually do anything, you need to sit there and ride it out – just sticking to your schedule will give you a win. If you don’t have the willpower to do it yourself, find somebody who will force you to do your work.

To stop cheap happiness from ruining your life, budget some money and time in your schedule for your favorite types of cheap happiness, but absolutely cut yourself off when your budget runs out. For example, I limit myself to $50 worth of alcohol a week and I never stay out with a girl past 3 AM unless she has already fucked me. If you can’t stick to your budget, you need to cut that thing off for good. Can’t control your drinking? Stop drinking – find some other type of cheap happiness.

**Rationalize your life** When you are depressed, your emotions will be working against you – they will want you to be listless, lazy, or go on crazy binges of cheap happiness. You have to fight that by organizing your life rationally. You need a strict schedule, a strict budget for your money, and strict rules that you absolutely cannot break (for example, no staying up after 10 PM on a weekday). This may sound childish, but until you have built up these good habits, you need them to be imposed on you from the outside.  I use the app Evernote for all the “rational” information for my life: my to do list, my grocery list, my calendar (with notifications), preferred businesses, books to read, and information about my bills, my car and home maintenance, etc...

Its a constsnt, never ending cycle. I am trying to understand the cause for it. But i can't. I hope that maybe someone on reddit   who feels the same, displays the same type of behavior can give some advice on how to deal with this or what has worked for them. 


Currently, I am a 3rd year university student, just finished my half a year long internship, I should be graduating in a year. I am in the best life position I have ever been in, yet I feel quite depressed and suicidal.

Last night I was hitting my head with my fist, and trying to choke myself with my belt. After a while, I started to question my actions and I calmed down.

Every single year, since I became a teenager, I have been experiencing absolute life highs and lows. One month i am on top of the world. I eat 3 meals a day, meditate, sleep well, do really good at the University, socialize, exercise. The next month i feel absolutely shit ,I skip lectures, classes, dont do homework, sleep 12 hours a day, stop eating/brushing teeth, stop exercising and stop socializing. I start telling myself that i am worthless, a piece of shit, that i shouldnt exist at all, that i am a lazy bitch, etc. I become very self destructive. To be honest, this has been going on for years. Nothing has changed at all since i was 13 till now,  almost 21. 

For some reason I try to do everything perfect despite my  understanding that perfection does not exist and shall not be pursued. The moment one piece of the entire project/course/plan falls out of perfection, i just stop being rational. I get stressed, anxious, depressed and suicidal. It drives me crazy. I feel all over the place, never committed, very compulsive. As if I am loosing control over my own mind.

I have a problem with cheap thrills (nicotine, masturbating, weed, alcohol), I love extreme sports, putting myself in dangerous situations, feel the adrenaline rush. Its the best feeling ever. Once i find something i enjoy, i abuse it till it no longer gives pleasure. Then i find a new thing, and do the same. 

Ever since I was around 13, I began to feel different. I started to find it difficult to communicate with friends, trust people, and I started to smoke cigarettes, drink beer. At that age, I was taking long walks by the sea alone, having a cigarette, listening to depressive music, planning a suicide. I began liking heavy music, spray painting, being a little hooligan.


When I get myself together, I can be a top student and be  great at everything I do. All of a sudden, the next day i just stop giving a fuck about the world and i stop taking care of myself. 

I try to apply logic and be rational, I try to look for the root cause of my problems. I am completely aware of my behavior, how may I potentially fix it. I have some sort of an idea of what's wrong, but i cant explain it. Its something beyond my expertise and knowledge. I cant explain it with logic. It just doesn't make sense and is driving me crazy. 

I have friends all around the globe, I study at a very good University, I am starting to generate my own income, i play bass, skate, play basketball. I always have something to do. I have nothing to complain about in life, i should be happy. But, I am not. I constantly keep on beating myself down. The pain and suffering begins to feel good. And I dont know why.",1587396098.0
151,Procrastination? In a loop of destructive habits? Try...,"As a lot of people here already know, breaking a destructive habit is difficult. Especially, when there are millions of triggers. And in order to get rid of a lot of triggers, you have to change your environment.

So if you are stuck at home, playing video games, not cleaning, procrastinating and feel horrible for trying to break these habits and failing every time, try rearranging your room. Your bedroom, your living room, kitchen any place where you spend most of your time. 

Turn your sofa around, change the direction of your TV is facing, buy a few plants and some new wall decoration. Get a carpet, or some photo stands. Maybe a new lamp? Be creative. You might not change who you are on the inside, but you have the opportunity to change where you live. And obviously, after you are done, clean the shit out of everything. 

Now, every time you enter your room, to your brain, the environment is completely different. Everything is unfamiliar. Nicer. Cleaner. You might lose some of your subconscious triggers. If you do, forming new habits and breaking old ones will be a lot easier. And if you do, it might snowball, motivate you, and it may make other habits a little bit easier to break. 

When I did it, I was amazed by how much easier it was for me to break some of my destructive patterns. I didn't really have to force myself. A lot of it was done automatically as my mind got familiar with the place and started creating new habits.

I couldn't recommend this enough.",1575206626.0
152,The perils of loneliness and isolation,"I have a limited bandwidth at the moment so this post will be shorter than I'd like it to be. I recently read most of a book that provides a summary of the loneliness literature from the field of psychology, the title is ""Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection"" and it's by Cacioppo and Patrick. If you read this book, you might find that it provides a disturbingly accurate characterization of the manner in which you reason about relationships, the problems that plague you and so on.

In short, loneliness is a kind of mentality that arises when our genetic instincts that pull us towards social connection aren't satisfied. Research suggests that different individuals have different needs for social connection but that this need is universal barring some sort of stark complication (sociopathy/psychopathy). When the need isn't satisfied, and this can be measured subjectively, it produces some dire consequences. Namely, the lonely person tends to be more likely to be paranoid about relationships, more likely to recoil in fear on a reflexive basis, the body and mind shifts itself into a different state, one that is extremely unhealthy both mentally and physically.

It's easy to see why this mentality arises, why it is incredibly useful for this tendency to exist in humanity. There's a lot of social scientific literature that examines the role of social organization in hunter-gatherer societies, which we all lived in for hundreds of thousands of years before the Neolithic Revolution - we needed to depend on others, bonds were critical to our survival and prosperity.

Therefore, when we sense that we cannot depend on others, the body/mind enter a kind of emergency mode that's designed to protect us from harm and, also, that's supposed to pull us towards others, but in a more guarded/defensive posture. The lonely person actually derives much more satisfaction from fleeting social contact than a non-lonely person. However, the lonely person is also more likely to see threats where there are none, fearing rejection, betrayal, and generally having limited trust in others.

I assume that this is a familiar story for many who have ever frequented this subreddit. It certainly provides an accurate characterization of the way my life has transpired over the past few years. Anecdotally, I have found that when I have been around friends or had deep social connections for a limited amount of time, my problems have seemed to miraculously disappeared. I often suffer from panic attacks, dismal depressive ruminations and the like. Those issues vanished out of nowhere in a brief period where I was part of a community for two months.

In light of this evidence, I am going to try to do everything in my power to shift away from the dark mentality that has defined my life, mostly by attempting to be more considerate of others and to try to be nicer without expectation of reward. If you read this book or read articles about this topic or even find what I've written here to echo your own struggles or problems, I hope you consider doing the same! You might feel that you're alone but that is a kind of cognitive distortion - you're probably surrounded by people, you just haven't seen them or considered them",1567443204.0

156,How I plan on “getting over it”,"1) unsub from r/depression:

I find myself wallowing in my sadness and giving into the unmotivated self when I read r/depression. I can see how it can be helpful, though. And I’m not exactly qualified to start giving advice...

2) work/go to class

When I haven’t done things, I feel useless and spiral. And when I miss class, I just cause more anxiety for myself.

3) socialize more (no more isolation)

I’ve pretty much avoided people on my floor since I got to college, but I talked to a few people today and they’re sweet. I’m not into the party lifestyle, but it’s nice to know the floor.

4) eat more

I’ve committed to eating more calories (at least 2000). The eventual goal is to bulk up and go to the gym, but I want to “learn” how to eat first.

5) meditation

Pretty self explanatory. I find myself “rushing” through the day and talking very quickly, which doesn’t help me socially. It ought to be good for me to slow things down. I also have an awful attention span/memory.

6) therapy

Talking to someone will be helpful. I haven’t been able to talk about my problems outside of this forum...

159,[31M] Just a lost a good friend to Covid. Grief is hard to get process.,"Hey. Lost a good friend I've had for almost a decade to covid pneumonia.  It was rough.  Saw his obituary last week confirming his death and I just broke down in shock and so many emotions.  It's Monday now and I still don't have it together.  His death  has left a hole and while I'm glad he is no longer in pain I still have negative feelings about myself.

It's weird.  His death makes me think about life, living to the fullest, and being the best I can.  He was a great friend and a wonderful person.  But It also has me thinking of my own depression, anxiety, and it is magnifying those things. Shame in myself. Guilt for not being a better friend to him while he was alive. Guilty that I am not going back to work yet despite it (teleworking some so that is a blessing).

I feel like a mess. I am going to reach out to my work's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for help with grief and other feelings and thoughts but it's very difficult right now. I feel like I am a burden to my friends who have their own lives and things to do along with grieving our friend as well. So I am just here. I don't know. One day at a time I guess?

I will start with rebuilding my routine.  Going to go to bed a a decent time and get up at my normal time  I would be getting up to get to work comfortably.  And spending less time checking stuff on Internet.   Going to the internet is an easy thing for me to do when I feel the negative feelings and discomfort coming.

 My parents have never given me an opportunity to flourish and build my personality, I never played with friends outside as a kid, or had sleepovers, I was never encouraged to have hobbies. They pretty much made me only focus on school and that wasn't even conducive since I only had slightly above average grades.

 I probably spent my childhood caught up with made up scenarios in head. I always felt more comfortable living in my small fantasy world, interacting with these very distinct characters who have their own names and personal lives, so I wouldn't be surprised if I were actually diagnosed with MDD.

 This may sound rude, but I hate social butterflies who always try to be positive and bubbly all the times, but it's generally those types of girls that others want to be around ,and who men tend to be more drawn to.  
Seeing other people have a good number of friends and dating experience is really saddening given that I only have 3 to 4 solid friends, and never dated anyone

 What's even worse is that I lack that discipline to build social skills, to have the guts to speak to people, attend events or do fun activities. I don't have any specific hobby that makes me stand out, that ""it"" factor that makes others interested in me.

162,I am Extremely Envious of People Living in Western Secular Countries,"  Not sure if this will come across as insulting. I understand different people have different struggles, and I'm not trying to invalidate anyone's struggle. I'm grateful for the many privileges I have, yet there are a few things in my life that I haven't chosen to be part of that are leading me to suicide.

(TL;DR: I feel super lonely because my upbringing doesn't allow for me to get in a relationship.)

  
  Whoever read my posts would know I've complained on and on about this issue, but I haven't found a practical solution to overcome it. As long as I don't figure this out, I will forever be miserable dwelling on it. What I need most importantly is emotional support, which I know for fact I will never get from my community because my struggle is undiscussable.

  
  I come from a country that's 99% Muslim. I left my faith 5 years ago and have been closeted ever since. It was never my decision to be a Muslim. I was just born into it. I think it's incredibly unfair that someone isn't supposed to think for themselves and choose whether to believe in something or not without fearing for their life.

  
  What I hate the most about my situation, besides having to keep this huge secret and having to conform to standards of my society, is that I don't have a love life. Dating is forbidden in my religion, and my strict parents complicate things even more, I'm 19 and I can't even talk to men on the phone or go out on dates. I'm expected to stay ""pure"" until someone wants to make me their spouse.

  
  Society likes to gaslight people into thinking they shouldn't want an intimate relationship, by making it seem like love only exists in romance movies and that we're merely falling victim to the globalization of western culture.  
They like us to believe that love is for children and the elderly, and you shouldn't get attached romantically to people of the opposite sex.  


  I deserve to enjoy the small things in life. I was miserable as a child. I felt emotionally neglected, I wasn't allowed to do fun activities like playing theater, I wasn't allowed to hang out and play with kids outside. I spent the entire day either going to school or being home doing homework. As a result I grew up with no social skills, even talking to a cashier or talking to someone on the phone til this day is very challenging to me. It didn't help that I was constantly bullied by my older sibling and my classmates.  


  Now I want to live a life that is worth living and the first step for me to achieving that is moving to another country. Except as time goes on, the more I realize that's nothing more than wishful thinking.  
  Having helicopter parents is a special kind of hell. Growing up I was absolved of any responsibility besides school and now I'm basically a grown child. I can't even get a legal document or book an appointment for myself. How am I supposed to move to another country, on my own, and find a stable job and a place to live? I can't even further my education abroad and live in campus while I get my shit together because not only I don't have the grades for it since I'm failing at school, but it also costs a lot of money.  


  I don't want to grow up not having experienced a relationship. I would hate to die alone and childless, which I'm sure is the only option I have if I stayed here. I can't handle being married to a Muslim no matter how open-minded they are because our values are very different, and I can't live my life hiding a secret and wishing things were different.  


I can't even date people from other countries because no one really wants a long-distance relationship. If I had plenty of options, I myself wouldn't want to be in one.  
I hope what I'm about to say doesn't make me sound desperate, but I feel extremely lonely. The only thing that sustains me is fantasizing about being physically close to someone, having my emotional needs met.

166,Working with my hands really helps me be less depressed.,"
I just need to get off my ass and actually do it.  I have found out I really love all these things welding, slight of hand magic  and stained glass, however my ADHD and depression pretty much make me just want to be on my computer all day.  I know those things make me happy, even though my brain keeps telling me that no one gives a shit about those things I know it isn't true...How do you best tell these negative thoughts to just go away.  Like sometimes I really think what is the point of anything anyway?

167,I'm starting to feel afraid that I've lost too much of myself because of my depression.,"I get anxious really easily nowadays. I am not even like what I was when my depression first started to flare up. I've always believed that the depression just brings about the worst in me, and that my ""real self"" is locked up deep down. I've never questioned why I believed this, but it helped me believe that I could still achieve my goals if I focused hard enough.

But recently, I read this post by someone who talked about how abuse changed his younger sister and even after 6 years she still isn't herself yet. Yes, my depression isn't close to what that young girl went through, but I can't help but imagine that even if I do get better, I'll never be funny. I'll never be likeable. I'll never be smart. There are so many reminders everyday that I should give up, and it's tough to keep moving along and ""deal"" with these things. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

168,"My girlfriend attempted suicide, and blamed me for that","Back in December, my girlfriend attempted suicide - the 4th time in her life, the first since I know her. We had been together for about 2 years, a month prior we had spent a week in Paris and Disneyland. She's always been unreliable, with me, strongly fluctuating between deep, deep love and pure hatred. She used to say the most horrible things to me during constant arguments, such as ""I'm happy you've been fired, you deserve it"", ""You're a 1000 times worse than my ex was"" or ""Everybody hates you. Ever wondered why? You suck."". Sometimes she argued so hard I had a couple of panic attacks while on the phone with her.

The day before the attempted suicide, we had had yet another argument. She started yelling at me, 'cause she had had a bad day and I tried to talk about it, but she didn't want to. We ended up arguing on the phone till 3 AM. The day after I sent her a message on Facebook, saying that I had enough, that I was gonna stop trying to make her reason, and that being so irrational, sometimes cutting herself and being so distructive towards our relationship even though she loved me, I wanted her to see a therapist that could help her sort that out. She replied ""I don't wanna go to therapy, I'm perfectly fine and I don't wanna throw my future out of the window"". I was genuenly worried about her, and said ""Don't you see you have trouble dealing with people in general, not only me? You can't really go on like this forever. How are you get a job?"" (A week prior, she had argued so hard with my boss, she quit her position at the office I work at).

She went went ""If this time around I'm successuful, tell 'em I'm sorry"". And proceded to swallow 12 pills of expired xanax. She then called me, lying on the bathroom floor, unable to breath or walk. Being unable to drive all the way there myself, I grabbed another phone and quickly rushed to call her brother who then reached her, and called an ambulance.

My mum drove me to the hospital. I was then called by a Doctor: she was lying on a bed, her relatives there looking at me. The Doctor started yelling at me, and then her parents, saying that my girlfriend had blamed me, that she had attempted suicide because of what I had told her. I bursted in to tears…

Since then, my life's snapped in half and nothing is the same.

She's fine, she came back home a week after and going to therapy since then. Is it my fault, if she almost died? I'm haunted by this tought.",1554721002.0

It was developed for and tested on teenagers and it has proven to be as successful as regular therapy in treating depression. It is based on CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy).

Personally, I have been through the first few modules and I like it so far. One, cavet is that there is no save function if you don't want to complete all the levels at once. Though you can simply replay the levels or leave your browser open. It's not perfect and it certainly isn't Call of Duty but if you are feeling crappy it is worth a try.

172,"My life is in shambles, and I don't want to be anymore.","I don't really know what to say or what I'm looking for honestly. I guess more then anything I just wanted to  wright this down. I don't know if I'll word everything correctly or not but here goes nothing. 

Eight months ago my family of whom I am the oldest son was struck with the covid virus. My father, mother, brother and his fiance all live together. Out of all of us I was the only one not to get infected. My father was the only death in our family. 

The loss of our father, the patriarch of the family was life altering. He was my step father in all honesty. But more of a man then my biological father could ever hope to be. He taught me everything I know about how to be a good person. How to work hard, do what's right, be a man. At fifty years old he took on a woman who was very ill coming off a terrible divorce with a one and five year old. Then rasied them as his own, honestly better then he rasied his own. He was everything to me, to us.

My mother and me have a complicated relationship. That I could honestly wright a book on. But I think a lot of people feel that way about their parents. My mother is genuinely a good person. Just someone who was shaped by a terrible childhood and her own narcissistic mother. She learned early on that attention was the only way to truly exsist. And now she is a woman who truly can not help but demand to be the very center and sole focus of every bodies attention. 

She wasted no time in turning my father's death into something about her. At first it was all about her pain. She would tell me and my brother every day that she hurt more than us. That it was impossible to hurt as much as her. Becuase it was her husband that she lost while we just lost our father. Then it became that she didn't want to live. So me and my brother had to set up a make shift suicide watch for her. After that we somehow convinced her to go to therapy. Which only helped her in finding a boyfriend. One that I was not told about untill the day before he came to our house to stay the weekend. 

I'm glossing over so many things and events in all of this. My mind is just lost. I don't honestly know what's up or down right now. I feel hollow in a way that I never have before. I'm not angry or upset honestly I'm not. There's just so much nothing in my life right now.  I feel like I drift every day dragging my lifeless husk of she'll into the day. Nothing's really exciting to me. Nothing's fun, or happy, nothing makes me angry, or sad. I just want to work do what needs done at the house. Then sit and watch TV or play a game. Just pass the time until I sleep and can forget I exsist for a few hours. 

Because I know, I know that the only happy moment of consciousness that I'll have in my day is the few moments in the morning I have, before my brain remembers what my life is. 

I don't really want to die, more like I just don't want to exsist any more. I want to blink and not be.",1624325144.0
173,I can't get past the feeling that a friend doing better than me in a multitude of life aspects and attractive qualities means that *I* am worse or lesser than them. The advice to change to be better like them hurts.,"I have been aware of one of my big depression and anxiety spikes being the compare and despair tendency. We're advised to not compare ourselves negatively to others but recognise that we're all different. However, sometimes it seems that friends just 'objectively' ARE more attractive, popular, successful etc. than you. I can think of friends who have hard lives but are, on metrics relating to personal effort and how people respond to them, better than me.

A lot of advice to resolving this involves getting past the jealousy of them being better than you and focussing on copying them until you adopt their attractive qualities. Personally for me, while I do it a little, this advice doesn't work for me the best consistently, since it involves having to reject who I am and become more like someone else. This is painful, like it literally makes my heart skip a bit to have to deny my capacity to love myself until I am more like The-Better-Person.

174,It's been exactly one year since I put a loaded gun to my head,"The reason I had gotten to that point was because I felt like I had run out of options. Despite everything I tried, things only kept getting worse, until it seemed it seemed impossible that they would ever get better. I felt hopeless and I wasn’t really planning on being alive by now.

Now that it’s been one year, I can say that although I think I still have a long ways to go, things actually have gotten better. The process wasn’t what I expected. It has taken a long time and I’ve had many, many ‘setbacks’ (the incident in the title wasn’t even my lowest point, I still hit several more lows after that. In hindsight it was probably good that my firearm got confiscated by police for several months). It’s also taken a lot of help. But I do feel alive again. 

I still struggle, still have trouble managing my emotions. Those feelings of hopelessness, isolation, exhaustion, etc. still come back to hang out for a while from time to time. But I’m definitely in a different space now than I was a year ago. Maybe its because, when I find myself in another bad period, I know now that just because things keep getting worse doesn’t mean they can’t ever get better.

I can’t go back in time and tell these things to past me, but I hope my experience can be helpful to anyone who’s in the position now that I was then. Everybody’s different and has a different situation, and I’m definitely not qualified to give out advice. But anybody is free to message me if they want to talk… about whatever.

178,How I overcame emotional numbness,"Long story short: For several months this year I had severe depersonalization, delusions, and panic attacks, due to pulling multiple all-nighters per week for months in late 2014. Once the depersonalization and panic attacks calmed down in March, I was left with almost complete emotional numbness and intense fog-brain. I did not regain my typical depth/range of emotions (or memory, for that matter) until last week, although I had been making steady improvements since June. Here's how I overcame the anhedonia and became motivated again:

- **Realized that if I was going to feel the same (numb and bored out of my mind) no matter what, I may as well do at least one task a day that would benefit my health and/or my future cured self.** Ex: I summoned all my mental energy and cleaned my entire room using the Marie Kondo method. Took 3 days. Decluttering my room helped me feel a little calmer and like less of an unproductive slug. Go on a twenty-minute walk everyday, delete old files, make a healthy grocery list. The idea is to feel productive and empowered by completing a small but useful task.

- **Got outside/in nature.** Staring at a computer screen indoors deprived me of vitamin D and made my brain foggy. Being in nature (especially bodies of water) improved my attention span and I became more comfortable sitting with my own thoughts. Plus, getting outside can shake up your routine--rediscover that park or trail (or backyard!) you haven't been to in ages. 

- **Took care of my body.** The brain is an organ--what affects the body ergo affects the brain. For me, dairy, added sugar, and lack of sleep slooooow my mind down and make me feel blah. Sugar inflames the body, which negatively affects [mood](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19423079) (and acne!). I did the Whole30 for two weeks and noticed a huge improvement. The Whole30 is a program that requires participants to cut out wheat/dairy/added sugar/alcohol/legumes for 30 days. Exercise also helps, even in tiny amounts. You can go to bed knowing you did at least one useful thing that day and didn't waste the past 16 hours. Exercise helps neurotransmitters maintain a healthy balance, too. But most importantly: SLEEP. Most of us know deep down when our body needs rest. Obey your circadian rhythm, folks. The app [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com) is helpful for those late-at-night internet addicts. And if you want to go to bed earlier, get into bed at the time you want to fall asleep, and your body will adjust if that time is right for you. 

- **Was around people.** Exercise at the gym. Read at the park. Shop offline. Being around people who are getting shit done/shower at least twice a week will help you feel less feral and more connected to other people. It reminds you that hey, I'm part of a society bro and what I do with my life matters. Plus the social interaction is nice and not too draining if that's your concern. 

- **Cut down on internet usage.** I don't know the science behind it but something about being in front of a computer or phone screen fragments my attention and exhausts my mind. You think you're relaxing, but your brain is just tuckering itself out. Reading a magazine or a book doesn't have the same effect. Bonus: if you're not on the internet, you can complete a small but useful task!

Don't get discouraged if you aren't immediately cured in .35 seconds. It took me about two months of doing all these things, after 3 months or so of total numbness, to feel better. But you CAN get better! Obviously I'm not a doctor and for a few of you more drastic measures might be needed. But for most, effort and time are the best salves. Here are some related links:

A lot of the times in life we will go through hardships and things will happen that set our progress back but its always important when you are struggling, to remember why you are chasing your goals 
It is easier to give up than to give up in tough situations than it is to persevere and that’s why people tend to quit.

**3. Write it and rehearse it**

This is the easiest way to remember your why and stay on top of you game
whether you use your phones note pad or write it on actual paper if you can write it and visualize it, you can achieve 



**4. Don’t do too much at once**

Don’t bite off more than you can chew 
There will be a lot of times where your goals are really ambitious and you just want to do everything you can but you sometimes life will get in the way and other things will come up and it will mess up your schedule and plans so you should remember to never put more on your shoulders than you can handle.

182,"Not depressed anymore but still have really low self-esteem, I’m uninterested in everything, and I feel detached from myself and my life. How can I feel like a person again?","Most people I’ve talked about this to really think that I’m still severely depressed (my old therapist, new therapist and psychiatrist included) but I really don’t feel that bad anymore. I was severely depressed earlier this year and I am feeling/doing drastically better than I was then. 

I kind of feel like I don’t really exist? 

My head is clearer now and I don’t feel as vulnerable or fearful. I have more mental energy to do things. I no longer have that overwhelming dread when I wake up in the morning. I can function relatively well. I’m ok with existing now. But I’m not really interested in people or my work or my future goals. I just feel kind of nothing, but not really in an unbearable way if that makes sense. I mostly just feel empty and disconnected and I don’t really have much belief in my ability to succeed or do well at anything (work, career, being a good friend/family member) - I don’t know how to just feel like generally a worthwhile person. 

I definitely have sharp downward spikes in my mood sometimes, but they are pretty far and few between and I don’t really have any interest in suicide (or self harm) anymore. And in my personal experience, if I’m not considering suicide (even passively) then I’m not severely depressed. I know this might not be true for everyone in a severe depression but it is for me.

I just can’t see myself as someone who could be happy or content in life. And I don’t have any desire for anything. I have no direction and I don’t know what I want anymore. How can I go back to wanting things again?

185,I destroyed myself,"I am a 27 y.o. male doctor in a cardiology residency at a small but elite private hospital/ rehabilitation center/ spa. I've volunteered there during medical school and they were impressed by me then and seemed to genuinely like me. I am a (co)author of several papers and used to be a huge metabolism/ immunity/ systems biology nerd. Played basketball in college. Generally had my shit together and felt like a person, doing person things, dreaming of a great career, but there was always an underlying streak of anxiety, like I'm building a stack of cards on an uneven table. I always felt behind on things, even when in reality I wasn't. And then a year ago, when I started my internship, all hell broke loose. My fiancee of 7 years left me, my sister got diagnosed with schizophrenia after a long period of unmedicated psychosis which included an involuntary hospitalisation after a knife attack on myself, and I felt like a rug got pulled from under my feet. Lost all interest and made a series of bad mistakes with patients which crushed my self confidence and sent me into a deep depression. They've been very patient with me ever since but instead of improving I keep regressing, slacking and just making a fool of myself. Not only have I stopped studying (I can't fathom the idea of it) but I forgot most of what I've ever learned, I can't even recall most basic practice guidelines that used to be second nature to me. I've developed bad social anxiety and now I'm pretty much a dumpster fire- unable to hold a basic conversation, unable to do simple procedures, unable to care for patients properly, unable to stick to deadlines with side projects, unable to keep a semblance of functioning. My hands are shaking, I avoid eye contact, I am genuinely terrified of some nurses (it sounds outrageous because it is), my vocabulary shrank to grade school level. I was the talk of the town for a while before nurses started outright mocking me and eventually stopped talking to me outside of basic, neccessary exchanges. People approach me with caution and I've seen an attending do the 'crazy' gesture when referring to me. This spilled over into my private life, I've been growing more and more ashamed of myself for quite a while and now I've just given up on living. I'm just floating around, chain smoke 2 packs a day and spend the rest of my day in bed. Remaining friends went from worried to disappointed. Suicidal thoughts come and go. I'm on several psych meds (tianeptine, olanzapine, bromazepam) and in therapy but it isn't helping. My psychiatrist reassures me it isn't a prodrome of schizophrenia, just bad depression/ anxiety/ burn- out/ perhaps a complex personality disorder that manifested itself later in life. I am awaiting a brain MRI just in case it isn't some nasty organic process, but I am highly doubtful. Has anyone ever been through something like this, and how do you recover? How do you build yourself up again? I already work out (albeit rarely) and I'm physically in shape so check that off the list.",1574710120.0
186,"Yesterday, I voluntarily went into suicide watch.","I feel better. But I'm terrified of continuing. 

For the past 3 years since my divorce, I've been all across this country and pursuing what I love. But I treasure a lasting relationship above all else. 

That being said I have no family I have only a handful of friends whom I took for granted.. I cannot have kids and I have no pets I have no physical anyting in my life and because I was in such a bad financial spot I rarely ever went out or did anything new I just sat in my room and read books for almost 2 years in order to grow my businesses.

For the past year and a half, I've had a girl that I was totally in love with. I paid for anything I could, got her into therapy, got her the confidence back in her life.. believed in her and put every last ounce of my soul into this person. I felt akin to her because she was also damaged but we were alike in every way. She even hated being alone just as much as me.. but that was the catalyst

Yesterday, I found out she has been dating someone else while I was away for the past 8 months. Became pregnant with him (which I helped her through while he was elsewhere) and now everything I put in.. the boyfriend calls me and she told him she doesn't know who I am. 

She never posted about me, never bragged and avoided being linked to me in any way because she was ""growing her name"" but within minutes I was blocked on all fronts and completely isolated and humiliated by a man that in all accounts is lesser, but he was physically closer while I was traveling. He told her in mere seconds to erase everything that I've done for the past almost two years. I didn't even have a chance. I was the side piece. 

The details here could never say enough about how much I tried to help. I literally went through hell for this girl because I believe in true work and that's the kind of love I grew up watching between my father and my mother. 

Last night I had nobody to turn to, none of my friends were around and I literally just got out of a colonoscopy for cancer in this foreign City. Still with my wristband on my arm I went and checked into suicide watch and stayed there all night. I haven't eaten in almost 48 hours or slept in just as long because all I can think of is how she sat there and took my character, the one that never slighted from her and just wanted to be a hero, she humiliated and crushed me.

I had to come to terms with this and realize that I can't change her and a therapist can't change me. I left suicide watch I went back into my truck and sat there for hours more and just begged internally for my mouth to say anything and breathe it into existence.

It never happened.

But.. 

I.. feel better. I realize I cannot control some things and I should really value the opinions of my best friends most. They truly had my back and I shut them down. I texted them all and told them how much I truly love them and just want them to know i was wrong.

It was not a reaction to a positive incident, but I was excited about watching this sport and I can't remember the last time I've felt like this (maybe more than 3-4 years ago). 

I still feel depressed, I still feel really sad that I have never dated anyone, and I feel sad that the girl I liked didn't like me back and that makes me hate myself a lot.

I find it more exciting to listen to music and my mind feels like a weight is lifted off it. I am also kind of arrogant.

190,I wasn't productive all week and now I feel overwhelmed and I'm considering giving up on college.,"Hey everyone, I need some help. I have a finals in 2 weeks and a lot of assignments due up until then. I was pretty depressed all semester and still am, but for a week or 2 I bounced back a little and was starting to do better. On Monday I was pretty motivated and made a list of everything I have to do and by when. It was kind of overwhelming realizing how much I had to do, but I was convinced I could do it if I worked hard. I made a schedule to stick to that would allow me to get everything done. However, the next day a few things happened and sent me back into depression. Yesterday I went home at 3 pm and laid in my bed doing nothing until I fell asleep. Yesterday was so critical because I was supposed to get a huge chunk of work done since I get home early on that day. Then I was supposed to wake up at 6 am today and start my work but of course I didn't. I slept until 1 pm instead.

&#x200B;

Basically, I need motivation. My brain is trying to convince me that I ruined my chances at doing well this semester, because after wasting this time there is no way I can get everything done. I don't want to believe this is true. This is what I have to do:  


Short (5 page) research paper due Friday

Long (15 page) research paper due Monday (what I'm most concerned with)

Huge chemistry test next Wednesday and I have no idea of any of the material

Test on Monday (its open note so I just have a ton of notes to take)

Math quiz monday

Then I have finals and stuff but this is what needs to be taken care of by Wednesday.

And I'm working 11 hours this weekend. I know this is all my problem and its weird for me to post something so specific as my to-do list on here but I really need someone to tell me that this is manageable, to tell me that it isn't too late and that if I work hard I can do well on all of this. I have this terrible brain pattern where I let my anxiety paralyze me and prevent me from being productive completely because I feel it is ""too late"" and I am afraid I will fail so I don't try at all.

192,"It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life, but I've done a complete 180.","Hey guys, I just wanted to share my success story with those who've ever had their taste of depression. I'm sorry that this is such a long read, but I hope it can speak to those who find themselves on the same path.


I've struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. A few months ago, after I was caught stealing benzos from family and had attempted suicide, I landed myself in the care of a psychiatrist who initiated a test that would record the activity of my neurotransmitters. The results told me I was ""extremely tolerant to all kinds of stress treatment"" and that I was at ""extremely high risk for already having or for developing PTSD"", among many other things. I felt that I was a lost cause after hearing this; the test couldn't lie. To me, it was a immediate death sentence to any and all future happiness.


Depression is a silent killer; it slips into our lives during the most inconvenient of times and bombards us with its trickery and deceit, even when we're surrounded by joyful things and loving people it filters out that light and turns everything into bleak, washed-out memories.

I can tell you that depression rocked my world, and shook me to my core; it made me question my self-worth and existence constantly. I was stuck on a perpetual loop like a broken record (the record was titled ""A Symphony of Crippling Anxiety and Self-Loathing"", by the way.) I'd cry more often than I ate, and eat as often as I had rare bouts of happiness.


I was used to seizing with violent sobs on my bedroom floor. I was used to taking MDMA, LSD, and almost any drug I could get my hands on in hopes of finding a deep, lasting, and spiritual way out of my waking nightmares. I did all of this in hopes of returning to some sort of happy ""baseline"" that I hadn't felt in so long.


While I was depressed, I kept thinking that happiness was getting my life ""back"". The thing is, I didn't get my life back. Instead, I find myself in a brand-new world- a shiny new life that I built from its roots up, and everything and everyone I come into contact with keeps getting new-er.


I started by surrendering to sobriety. I took the new pills my psychiatrist prescribed me, even though they weren't what I expected, I went with it. It felt like it was going against what every fiber of my being thought was natural, but I COMPLETELY reprogrammed the way I spoke to myself and others. 

I started this by writing love letters to myself. I stopped romanticizing my depression and the bad things that happened to me, and I started romanticizing things that I thought were beautiful.


It felt unnaturally stupid at first, writing about how I liked the glow that street lamps cast at night... but those tiny blurbs and word salads about the most minuscule of things started to become a part of my inner voice-- the one that used to scream at me and be my own worst enemy. Those tiny things I took note of became bigger and started to intermingle with my life, and finally I started cherishing those pages as much as I cherish myself.


I went from taking enough pills to black out for 2 days to getting into a relationship; gliding across dance floors with the first person in my life who reciprocates my feelings for them. You see, all of that crying, self-harm and ruminations about suicide seem so far away now that I can barely touch them.


That same voice that told me I wasn't good enough to go to college...that became loud and violent and wouldn't stop reminding me of reasons why I'm hated by people I love...that same voice underwent a radical change in personality. It went from being an angry drill sergeant to a loving teacher, who has the Midas touch of joy and helps me to make my internal and external world burst with light and direction.


Anyways, sorry for rambling. I just thought I'd share my success story, since getting out of this has thus far been the most important thing in my life. (:",1453505024.0

&nbsp;

How are you? From what I remember, things are going pretty rough. Even though you’re lonely, angry, and cynical right now, things are going to get better. You have no idea what you’re in for. You’re 18 right now, and the place you’re in is totally different. Things are still sometimes lonely and frustrating, but nowhere near as much as they were in your time. You’re loved, and you’ve got so much love to give. In order to help make this frustrating, lonely, hard, fucking wonderful journey easier for you, I’m going to give you some advice that you probably aren’t going to listen to. You’ll need to figure it out for yourself. Isn’t that the way it goes? Anyways, here it is: 

&nbsp;



* People don’t hate you. What you fail to realize is that they’re just as nervous as you are. They won’t open up to you unless you open up to them. Don’t be afraid to make the first move.

----


* You won’t be good at everything the first time you try it, but that’s not an excuse to not stick with something. How the hell do you expect to get good at something if you don’t TRY?

---


* Most people aren’t actually judging you. Everybody’s fighting a battle that you don’t know about, even the jerks. Lots of it is over the same stuff you worry about. People are too involved in their own insecurities to judge you, and the ones that are have too much time on their hands.

---


* Girls want it just as much as you do; don’t be shy around them but don’t be a creep about it either. There’s a fine line, man. Nobody likes a fuckboy

---


* Don’t skip out on football games, dances, sports and certain types of music and clothing just because they’re popular. It’s cool if you don’t like them, but make sure you dislike them for the right reasons. Everyone has their dislikes, but hating something because it’s popular doesn’t make you a cool, independent rebel. It makes you a boring asshole who’s missing out on some good times. Stop trying to be James Dean and have some fun for fuck's sake

---


* Cologne can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Use it wisely, young Padawan

---


* Other people aren’t as obsessed with music as you are. Don’t make it the only part of your personality, or you’ll alienate people. Make it something to share with people but don’t limit yourself to just music. Branch out and make yourself a more interesting person.

---


* Read anything and everything you can.

---


* You have a lot of untapped potential that you haven’t realized because, oh, I dunno…YOU’RE FUCKING 13? You’re like just starting puberty, what makes you think this is as good as it gets when your voice is just starting to drop? Be patient, goddammit.

---


* Even though you won that D.A.R.E. award when you were 9, you’re gonna end doing a *shit-ton* of drugs when you get into high school. More specifically, you'll end up experimenting with weed, alcohol and psychedelics. It’ll happen when you’re ready. Even though you’re going to waste a lot of time, it’s going to be an important part of your life that everyone goes through to an extent. And eventually you’re going to get bored with them and start to be productive. That’ll happen when you’re ready, too. You’ll have good times and bad times on drugs. But whatever happens, know that the key is just to know your limits and know when you’re in too deep. Don't be stupid about them.

---


* Nobody looks good in cargo shorts. Ditch those bastards and get yourself a good pair of selvedge jeans. Eventually, you’re going to wear some and that hipster girl in you sit by in Trig will compliment the way your ass looks in them, and you’ll never go back to cargos ever again.

---


* No matter how lonely you are now, you’ll make some older friends pretty fast in high school. These ones will be the kind of friendships books are written about, the kind that people make movies about. You’ll laugh together and grow together and almost get arrested together. And then one day they’ll move on to college. It’ll hit you like a fucking ton of bricks, but don’t let it get you down.  You’ll adjust better than you think, and they won’t be totally gone. The people we love never really leave. You’ve got time to make plenty more memories with them.

---


* Don’t fall in love with a girl just because she likes the same books, shows, and plays as you. Even if she’s cute, talented and gives you an excuse to go to Chicago every weekend

---


* Don’t worry about that girl you’re too afraid to talk to who you have like 5 classes with. The only thing is that the timing is wrong. You’ll stop talking to each other for a few years, but when the stars align and you’re ready for each other, your paths will cross again and you guys’ll start to do really cool stuff together and fall in love with each other's souls. It'll be more than a crush. Just don’t sweat it and go with the flow.

---


* Most metal music is tacky, hard to tell apart, and a good way to alienate people. It’s cool if you listen to Rammstein but if you do, don’t be a little shit and try to shove it down everyone else’s throat.

---


* Pop music, school dances, and hip hop are actually really dope, you need to embrace your less pretentious and serious side if you want to form connections with people

---


* But appreciating art and culture doesn’t make you pretentious. If people say it does, they probably don’t get it themselves, and that’s totally okay. It’s just not their scene. 

---


* For God’s sake, shave. Those mutton chops you want…not gonna happen. You look like a pre-pubescent Chewbacca. And who the fuck looks good in mutton chops? Let’s get real.

---


* You’ll never truly be free if you judge people, even if the people you’re judging are the ones who treat people poorly.

---


* As much as you hate the town you live in, you’ll learn to see the positives to it. You’re getting ready to leave for college now, and you'll learn to appreciate it. The same goes for the world in general. There’s so much beauty in the world and we don’t take enough time to appreciate it.

---


* Even the worst person you know has one or two redeeming qualities. Look for the 80% you have in common with others instead of the 20% you disagree with.

---


* Don’t try too hard to be funny. Let it happen.

---


* Don't be afraid to laugh at yourself. 

---

* And finally, get a goddamn haircut, son. You’ve got really cool eyes, don’t hide them behind your hair.

---


* But most importantly, don’t EVER short change yourself. You actually turn out to be a pretty okay guy, just stay humble and don’t let it get to your head.

&nbsp;


These are things that, even though you’ll need to experience for yourself, will make you a stronger, better, more empathetic, more interesting person. You have no idea what you’re in for. You’ll reach the highest heights and the lowest lows and sometimes you won’t realize which ones are which until you look back at them. So it goes. Good luck on your journey, and remember; the journey IS the destination.  It’s a long, strange trip, but it’s totally worth it. Hang in there and never forget that you’re loved.

&nbsp;

Sincerely, 
Yourself at 18, Circa 2015

&nbsp;


PS. Puberty ends up treating you okay. You end up looking like Anthony Michael Hall but that ends up turning out to be a good thing

&nbsp;


PPS. Even though you're probably mad at him over something dumb, your dad's a pretty cool guy. You two will end up going to New Mexico with your uncle in a few years. You'll end up having your first beer with him and despite the occasional uncomfortable political debate, you guys'll end up gaining a better understanding of each other and growing closer ",1449895596.0
194,How I cured my depression.,"I recently came out of a 2 year major, suicidal depression with anxiety that was preceded by several years of adjustment disorder and at least 15 years before then of being moderately depressed, anxious and self-destructive. I now feel filled with a joy of life that I haven’t known since childhood and in every moment I am able to feel peace and joy even when I am stuck in a traffic jam or in physical pain. I want to share with you how this happened for me in the hopes that it can happen for you.

Real transformation means shifting your perspective, and challenging your beliefs. 

No meds, lifestyle changes, meditation, or anything else will be able to make believing a lie feel good, so first you must find the lies about who and what you are and stop believing in them.

Your depression is founded upon deep seated beliefs you picked up along the way that are probably totally false. I will be discussing one of the most common false beliefs and one which has resulted in untold suffering of billions of people for thousands of years: The belief about who and what you are. From a very young age we are conditioned, programmed, brainwashed to believe that we have a name, a birthday, a gender, talents and personality, etc

The truth is that none of those things is your true identity. The belief in a false sense of self is the main cause of suffering. This isn't some crazy theory. This is the essence of Buddhism and many other religions and philosophies and many kinds of therapy as well.

You have all kinds of expectations for who you are, what you think makes you happy, your opinions and beliefs, goals and dreams, your memories and emotions and talents. None of these things is who you are either. All of these things are in fact a product of the mind, which is thought and emotion as well as all of your memories. Who you really are is the observing consciousness that witnesses, watches, perceives and occasionally influences these things. I say occasionally because for most people, especially if you are depressed, you don’t feel able to choose consciously how to perceive and react to things that happen in your life situation. 

If you meditate and really go into this consciousness who is your true identity you will realize that it has no name, no form, no past or future, no reputation or personality. It is just pure being. ""Being"" is who you are. It’s also who I am and is one with all there is. This ""being"" is what Eckhart Tolle calls ""The eternal, ever present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death.""

So, when you realize that you are ""being"", you feel a sense of connectedness to all there is. You will feel the true joy, peace and love that comes with this realization. The crazy thing is that you have it right now. You just can’t FEEL it because your mind is making too much noise.

What you have to realize, meaning to make real in your experience, is that you have power over your mind. It may not seem now like you do, but in many cases this is due to the bad habit of unnecessarily and falsely empowering your mind by believing your mind to BE you, that is, by identifying with it. Identification with the mind makes thinking compulsive and negative and gives thoughts and emotions a level of power and force that they don't have in a healthy individual. 

Why does identification with the mind make it compulsive and negative? Because it is a lie. The truth is you are not your mind so when you believe otherwise you are always lying to yourself. This is the source of the dysfunction.

The first step for a lot of people is realizing that you are not your mind, but the observer of your mind in the now. That goes for the emotions too. Once you remember who you really are, that neutral observer who doesn't want anything more than what it has right now, which is the entire universe, you feel a sense of joy and peace and eventually true love that emerges from deep inside, and all around you, and others will feel it too.

It takes practice to disidentify from the mind, including the emotions and eventually even the senses and time and space themselves. It takes practice to remember that you are that dispassionate observer with no name, no birth, no death, no form. Some people will argue with you and tell you that this whole idea is a supernatural fantasy that science has dis-proven, but realize that these people are also identified with their minds.

The mind can never allow you to understand who you really are because it wants to survive like any other entity and when you withdraw consciousness from it by observing it, your mind based sense of self, which is called the ""ego"", feels threatened. So, most people choose to stay identified with the ego rather than risk losing the investment they have made in suffering. As Eckhart Tolle puts it: ""Imagine a chief of police trying to find an arsonist when the arsonist is the chief of police.""

The mind is the problem.

Most people are able to stay identified with their minds and even with their jobs and relationships and not be depressed. Are they luckier than you? They never really get to realize their true selves and experience true joy and love, unless they just happened to have had exceptional upbringing (conditioning) which taught them to stay in connection with their true selves and to release, rather than expressing or repressing, emotions so they do not become trapped in the body.

Depression is often a situation of compulsively imagining problems, usually in the past and future, and then we make an unhappy self out of our problems and have a feeling of unease and complaint, low level pain and dissatisfaction, a sense that we are cursed or doomed. When we withdraw consciousness from the mind and put it in our true self is when we become truly conscious. So, depression can be seen as a form of unconsciousness. You have to awaken your true self from its current state of unconsciousness. Awaken from the nightmare that you are your mind and emotions, past and future.

Say for example you have some emotions around motivation and work that you identify with that, when energized by your identification with them, create further emotional pain in your life by apathy, insecurity, and failing to get things done. This ""emotional pain body"" or false self that is the shadow of your ego feeds on your pain. The more pain you have, the stronger it grows. When you look at it, you will notice that it quickly collapses like when a child pulls the plug out of an inflatable toy. If you really can observe it and realize it is not you, but a false identity in you that you have been empowering through false identification, you will be able to watch it disappear like a monster in a nightmare once you turn to confront it.

It will try to come back over and over again. Your mind will always try to trick you into identifying with it, judging, analyzing, compulsively talking or thinking about its problems, past and future which aren't even real. It will try to take you out of the now and sabotage your joy so that you identify with it and hand over control to it so that it can create pain to feed on. When you notice any feeling of unease, complaint, or notice yourself thinking about the past and the future become alert, your mind may be trying to attack you. As Tolle puts it:

""When you start to disidentify and become the watcher, the pain-body will continue to operate for a while and will try to trick you into identifying with it again. Although you are no longer energizing it through your identification, it has a certain momentum, just like a spinning wheel that will keep turning for a while even when it is no longer being propelled. At this stage, it may also create physical aches and pains in different parts of the body, but they won't last. Stay present, stay conscious. Be the ever-alert guardian of your inner space. ""

One big thing to watch out for is that even once you have tasted the liberation and joy and peace that comes with this kind of awakening or enlightenment to your true nature is that the mind will go on and will probably try to attempt to claim this transformation or awakening for itself. It will try to get you to justify or prove these concepts so that they can be understood by the mind. But the fact is: ""Being"" cannot be understood by the mind. It can only be felt and known when the mind is still. Resist the ego's urge to make reaching enlightenment or ending depression a goal. It's available to you now if you can just stop your mind. Shut it off and you are instantly liberated and joyful and free!!!

Yoga and meditation will help, as will therapy, especially if you can get one that is highly present themselves and will help you with ""presence practice"" or ""being present"". It's all about learning how to recognize when you are not in ""the zone"" and getting back there. Physical stuff matters too. Gut bacteria or yeast being out of balance in your body can cause depression, as can a lack of sleep and exercise. Purify your diet. Eat all organic, cut out gluten, take pro-biotics, go low carb for a while to try and kill off the candida/yeast, get a sleep study done at a real sleep disorders clinic, exercise. Make sure you get plenty of sleep every night. Stop masturbating to porn if you do, cut out drugs and alcohol. All of these things are known to make depression worse. Living is a very fine art that takes focus and presence and you are discovering how to do it!

You can do it!

Good luck.

P.S. My breakthrough came when I was repeatedly listening to Eckhart Tolle's ""The Power of Now"", which also happens to be the best selling spiritual self-help book of all time, on audio-book. It took about 20 listens before my true self finally woke up and heard it and was like WTF? OMG! I know this is true!!! Once it did, my depression and all my past pain just dissolved. Maybe it will work for you? You can listen to it here:

195,I got dumped.,"We had been dating for 6 years and we're in our late 20's, I've been living with clinical depression and borderline bpd for years now, I was on meds for a while and she knew all about this from day one. I try my best to never show that side of me to her. Things have been going pretty badly ever since the pandemic mental health wise, monetarily,etc. And I've been struggling to cope up but I try to put up a smile and try to do tiny things for her. she came up to me hinting we should get married. I was so happy because I wanted to get married too but at the same time I was also worried about her happiness and well being cause of the person I am. I told her I want the same too but I should work on my mental health and also few more things career wise and when things settle atleast a bit, we'd get married. I was asking for help and trying to be more open about my mental health issues and explained everything.

She lost it when I said so, she thinks I'm making up this stuff because I have commitment issues. I tried explaining N number of times that it's not so and all I wanted was to have a peaceful life with her. Everytime she says that I just didn't do anything for her and it crushes me. And after an excurtuating amount of hurtful accusation for weeks, she dumped me. I was at an all time low and I was begging her to stop and not do this to me and she didn't give a fuck about what I was saying and just left. I've been literally saving up from my underpaying job to buy a ring to propose her, how tf can this be an commitment issue? And it just hurts me so badly that someone who's known me inside out for 6 years just ditched me like this for something that isn't even real. I don't know what to do anymore. Memories just eat me up from inside. My existing mental health issues are just getting worse and I've been having really bad thoughts lately.

Anyway. I'm here to ask you people, has anyone been here, if so how did you get over it or do I just have to make peace with the fact that I'm fucked?",1629005875.0

197,TIL I tick all the boxes for childhood emotional neglect,"I've felt all of these intimately for years, but never knew it was a full-on diagnosis.

* Afraid of relying on others, and reject offers of help, support, or care.

Why would I? People are ephemeral and fickle.

* Have a hard time identifying strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and life goals.

Be a lot easier to identify any strengths if I had any.

* Way harder on myself than I would ever be on a stranger, and utterly lack self-compassion and understanding.

Why do I deserve compassion? Who gives a damn?

* Blame myself almost exclusively, direct your anger inward, or feel guilt or shame about your needs or feelings.

Better inward than outward. And I absolutely should have control over how I feel (though I don't).

* Feel numb, empty, or cut off from emotions, or feel unable to manage or express them.

Again: who gives a damn?

* Easily overwhelmed and give up quickly.

No one wants anything done unless it is done well. Seeing as I can do nothing well...

* Extremely low self-esteem.

See above.

* Extra sensitive to rejection.

When it's all I've ever experienced my entire life, you'd think I'd be more used to it. But I'm not.

* Believe I am deeply flawed, and that there’s something about me that is wrong even though I can’t specifically name what it is.

For eight years, like many others I suffered from severe depression, self hatred, self inflicted wounds. The list goes on, recently like last year I got tired of hating myself, walking in darkness, crying myself to sleep every night. So I decided to go on a self love journey, just to see if I could do it. this would be my last result before I took drastic matters.... but it worked. After five long months of digging through my past traumas and laying the skeletons to rest. I found true happiness, now I still have bad days but there nothing like the past eight years of depression and with this newfound happiness, self love, peace. I decided to make my podcast ""One time for a good time"" to talk to the people that are still in a rut, struggling, finding their way in life. I want this podcast to be a place where people can come to be uplifted and find peace. I see a lot of people on here have their ongoing internal battles, and I thought it would be nice if I shared a little piece of my happiness with you guys. So please if you want to check it out that would be great, but if you don't maybe share it with someone you think it could potentially help. Love you guys, stay blessed.

199,I found a new therapist who makes me feel understood and the effect is already showing after one session,"I've been suffering from persistent depression disorder for a very long time, but I only started looking for help about three years ago. At that time I came across a web comic that finally made me realize it's not normal to feel so down so often, and that just because I wasn't seriously considering suicide, that didn't mean I couldn't be depressed. Anyway, I was assigned a therapist by my GP, but I didn't feel like she understood me and at some point I just stopped going. I then found one I did like at a mental health institute where I had an intake, but unfortunately, she left before I even had my first official session planned, and I once again had a therapist I felt didn't understand me. I thought at that point that it was me, so I 'toughed it out', but ofc in the end that didn't really lead to any great results. I looked for a new therapist, but there were insane wait lists. I found a private one that was still covered by my insurance and I figured, if I don't get her, it will be months before I'll be able to go to therapy again, and at that point I was probably at my lowest so I took a chance. However, again, I did not connect with her. Every once in a while when I would try to explain to her how I was feeling (which I'm not great at), she'd try to 'help' me, but those helping words just made it painfully clear to me that she had no idea what I was talking about. Still, I stuck with her for almost two years because I figured she was a good therapist, that it would get better, that it was just me...

Last Jan/Feb I left to go on my dream trip to South America, aka the great escape from real life, and with that, my therapy automatically ended. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic I had to cut my trip short. I had been planning on going from Chile to the US, to attend and be a part of my American BFF's wedding, then go back to Europe to spend the summer with my friends and family, before leaving to start a job in Asia right around now (I might be trying to run away from my problems by moving to a different continent, but hey, it's worth a shot). I guess it's pretty obvious the pandemic ruined some of my plans... When it really hit me I might be stuck living with my parents for the rest of 2020 and maybe even longer (I gave up my own place before heading to SA and without a steady job I can't get a new one), I started spiralling. Around that time my old therapist sent me an email asking for a video conference because she had to write a report for my GP/insurance and she wanted to hear my reflections on our time together. I managed to tell her I wasn't doing so great but that I would rather find a new therapist, and she gave me some great tips. With those, I found one near where I live now. For the first time, I'd be talking to a male therapist. I was quite apprehensive when I talked to him on the phone and although he immediately said that he'd take me on, I was a bit hesitant and told him I wanted to meet first before deciding.

I met him this week and he exceeded all my expectations and took away all of my doubts. He let me talk for a while, then asked spot-on questions and then made connections/drew conclusions that I had as well, but have had a lot of trouble getting across in the past. Instead of treating me like 'Oh, lots of people feel this way, if they can get better, then so can you!' like my previous therapists did (note: in a(n attempted) motivational tone, not a condescending tone, and probably phrased differently), he treated me like the most interesting specimen he'd ever come across and that he'd love to unravel. I guess this might put some people off, but for me, it did the trick. Before, with my previous therapists, I'd felt like a failure: if this works for so many people, then why isn't it working for me? What's wrong with me? He made me feel unique and heard. Even though I've only had this one session with him, and due to him going on vacation my next session won't be til September, I already feel so much better. I am motivated to turn this depressing time around. I feel better already just having adopted this mindset. I went to excercise. I got out my drawing stuff and my camera. I applied to several jobs. I even caught a decent amount of sleep! 

It's just amazing that something seemingly so small - feeling understood - can have such a big effect. I know that it isn't only up from here, I know that I will still feel depressed or down quite often for the rest of my life, but I finally feel I found someone who can give me the tools to deal with it so I won't spiral or get stuck in it again. And I'm not sure if any of you care, if any of you have even read all of this, but I felt motivated to write this down and share it, so I can prolong this feeling a bit and maybe, hopefully, inspire someone to look for the same sort of connection.",1596315842.0
200,I get really sad whenever I watch a movie or a TV show. It just feels like I'm incapable of being remotely close to a normal person.,"I watch a few tv shows and movies. Just normal popular movies and shows. And when I see the actors with their friends and the people the date it just seems so unnatural to me. I want to be the person people like. I want to have likes and dislikes. I want to be a person who someone who girls might actually want to date. 

But I'm not. I had certain good qualities before I was depressed. I would have been a nice person. I was a popular kid. But then I got depressed and just didn't develop. Now I'm not even depressed anymore but I'm still a useless hypocrite who gives fucking lame advice to people who post here thinking it will make my miserable life a bit better. 

The only think I can do is distract myself so that I don't recall how pathetic I am. At least when I was depressed there was some hope that things would end permanently. I am just in this abyss now. Work so that I forget my pathetic life. I'm probably useless at work as well except I don't realize it. I don't know what is the truth and what is not the truth but I keep dishing out advice like I'm a learned depression survivor. 

I think I just want attention. I don't know at this point. I don't understand why I'm so insecure and useless. My identity of being a depressed loser is now gone as well. I don't have any excuses. I am just a loser. I'm not friendly. I'm not kind. I'm not funny. I'm not interesting. I'm nothing anymore. Just someone who exists. I'm sorry for taking up your time when there are people with real problems here. I just want someone to like me.",1589053053.0
201,"""Whether you feel worthy or unworthy, you are always worthy, but in the latter case, you have unhealed wounds.""","**Explanation**: The mind has the ability to make us believe lies, such as being unworthy. Victims of abuse often experience self-worth issues, and these illusions are so compelling that we think they are real. The truth is, seeing yourself as unworthy is just a defence mechanism, and abusers may need you to doubt or hate yourself so they can feel good about themselves. If you were not enviable to begin with, why would they bother hurting you?

It still stings  now which is so weird, it’s such a long time ago, I don’t keep in touch with any of them. It just reminds me of where my constant feelings of being unwanted come from.

Anytime I have a new task or a new place to go to I’m overcome with this huge dread that just makes me want to hide away from the world and not do anything. I feel scared to go to new places and do things when I haven’t ever been there. I’ve been studying for a few days in my apartment and feel as if I’m getting super stuck on staying inside. Does anyone ever have any anxiety or dread when doing new things or going to new places or is that just me.",1568739574.0
204,"I'm learning that getting over it is a SLOW process, and that's okay.","First post here.

I've dealt with anxiety and depression my whole life.

2019 has been a mostly positive year for me. Work is steady, just like debt. I'm lucky enough to be able to stay above the debt, though. I'm trying to focus on the positives, mainly the fact that I have a place to live and can feed my family.

Changing my surroundings has been a huge boon to my mental health and has helped me deal with my issues. First step was having a clean environment. Last weekend I purged my apartment and made it brand new. A week later, I'm still keeping up with keeping the place clean and organized. Forming new habits is huge and I'm doing well in that aspect.

I've largely neglected exercise, which I know is important to mental health. I hope to address that this weekend. It's hard to change things overnight, but having a clean place to live was more important to me last week. If the weather weren't so crappy, I'd clean my car out, but I can't stand being outside in the snow and slush, so unfortunately I'm just gonna deal with a messy car for now. As long as I'm occupying my mind with improving some other aspect of my life, I'm okay. Speaking of my car, last weekend I saw a mechanic and got some minor things fixed before they could become a future issue. I also renewed my registration and went to court to have my case involving my expired registration dropped. Shout out to the officer who pulled me over and was cool with just giving me a citation so I could fix the problem.

I used to drink too much. Thankfully, the combination of being strapped for cash and feeling better overall has kept that in check. I have multiple alarms set on my phone and my smartwatch that remind me to take my meds for asthma, anxiety and IBS. Haven't had an issue remembering to take them since they keep me healthy.

I've got a long way to go...I might not make all the goals I've set for myself immediately, but the fact that I'm consistently working toward them is helping me stay motivated.

Thanks for reading.",1550905554.0
205,I realized my happiness is too dependent on other people.,"And that's why when circumstances change with the few people, it can completely throw me off my feet for a long time. And I don't know how to fix this.

Like for example. My brother. I could talk to him about anything. We had our inside jokes. He was like the MAIN person I talked with. When he passed away it took me about 7 years to come to terms with it, although grief I realize isn't something you completely can get over.  I can say for sure that my grief was a REALLY messy, complicated one because I had a major emotional dependency on him. He was understanding, validating, funny, and so much.  I guess it's normal for people to have trouble with grief, but I know that I wasn't adjusting the way most people would or going on with my life as most people would.

Even in past friendships I can become very needy. I can get disappointed when they don't meet my needs. I can take what they do personally even if it's not personal.  I can perceive things as neglect when it isn't one.  I usually end up ruining the friendship in that way by expecting them to fulfill everything,  thinking it's their fault that I feel this black hole inside of me, even though I don't always make my needs be known and even though I don't often initiate anything with them, which I now realize is pretty messed up on my part. My needs to have someone listen and understand, whatever that need is, I put it all on a few people to pick up on it.

Same with my relationship. I become SUPER emotionally needy. I need to be around them all the time. I perceive certain things as them not caring even if it's not meant to be that way.  I feel agitated when he's not meeting my needs, even though all my needs aren't his responsibility, that's too much for one person to shoulder.  And when relationships break, it almost feels like all my happiness was stolen along with them and I don't know what to do with myself.

I guess I am kind of lonely, and don't have a lot of people in my life to begin with, but even when I do have people I end up ruining it because of this dependency and like this constant emotional need that seems like it can never be completely filled, but how can I make sure that I'm not so dependent on other people to make myself feel less empty?",1543022799.0
206,Way to encourage me to change my sheets,"Hi everyone- I’ve struggled since I was 18 with depression and anxiety. One of my first warning signs of my depression rearing its nasty head is I stop cleaning my room and/changing my sheets. It just gets to be too much you know? Well I figured out the best way to motivate me to change my sheets is by buying ones that I really love and that excite me to see. This two weeks is a flamingo pattern, next two weeks is bright colorful stripes! It’s done a lot for me to have something to look forward too and allows me the opportunity to not let something like sheet changing weigh in over my head! What is some things you do to encourage cleaning your room/changing your sheets?",1530578943.0
207,Why the fuck should I have to act excited for a chance to exchange labor for barely enough money to put a roof over my head. I can't deal with the charade.,"Every post about job hunting talks about ""people who really want to be there"" and are dedicated. It's all bullshit. I don't understand how any sane person can be excited by the utter lack of respect and potential that the current workplace has to offer. It's a simple matter of exchanging physical labor for monetary reward. Leave what little is left of my soul out of it. 

I can't fake wanting to do something enough to even finish filling out an application most of the time. If it wasn't for the cold I'd almost rather live in a tree. Recently I saw an episode of Undercover Boss (which seriously lost all of it's touchy-feely charm it had in the first season). This guys owns a Hooters knockoff. One girl had the gaul to (while she thought he was a real person) tell him that she was only there because she got fired from a much better career and would be out the door as soon as she got another offer. Apparently he just couldn't understand why a girl would not want the ""coveted position"" (seriously, he said this) of being a waitress in a titty bar. And during the big reveal at the end, he fired her on camera. Then he had the nerve to pretend like he was doing her a favor and could send her resume to other people.  WTF.

The economy makes me want to puke. I get the distinct impression that people really believe anyone who didn't study engineering or business deserve to starve. I don't want to have to fill out a 20 page app with everything that could have been on a 1 page resume plus a loaded questionnaire that violates the ADA so hard with clinical mental health screening questions for fucking min wage at Chili's only to never hear from them again. I don't want to have to become a web designer like everyone else. People have to realize that stupid bubble will pop like everything else. I just want to live my goddam life and do something useful that doesn't make me want to sit my wrists.",1421171552.0
208,"I am stronger than you, depression.","I am stronger than you, depression, now that I know your name. Each and every day that you suck the hope out of my world is one more day that I grow stronger. Every second that you take from me is one more second I will to overcome. Today I may be yours. And even tomorrow. And even for weeks you can make me claw the insides of my skull until I feel dead. But you won't take me with you. You won't take me. You can't have me.

I know better than you, depression. And just because you now have a name, and the nurse gives me the pills for you, I know they are not the answer. I know that every trough I fall in to will just be another way to climb back up. I know that what goes up must come down. I *know* that I can *beat* you. I refuse to focus on your chaos. I refuse to wonder why. I know that you will give me no answers, so I'm going to stop asking you questions.

I know that I'm better than you, depression. I know that I deserve better. I know that I am capable. I have dealt with worse things than your vague emotions. I have dealt with worse things than your sense of dread. You wage a battle of attrition, but I *refuse* to give in. I *refuse* to give up. I *refuse*. Another day will come, and this one will end, and even if you're there tomorrow, another day will come, when that one ends. One day you will be gone, because I will have mastered you.

210,I can't cope with my shame. I cannot see myself as a person worth working on. I feel bad for everyone that knows me on a personal basis and want to cut myself off from everyone. I have done things I cannot forgive myself for and can't tell anyone. I don't know how I can go on like this.,"I have come to realize a key emotion that rules my life is shame. I am ashamed of who I am. I am ashamed for things I have done. I feel lower than worthless, like I make the lives of people I care about worse just by existing. I don't know how I can go on like this.

Almost every day I think about cutting off everyone I know and going into total isolation. I am not someone worth knowing, even if I appear to be kind and conscientious I will inevitably make myself a burden. I feel like it would be better for everyone if I interacted with people as little as possible.

I can look people in the eye but I feel like I shouldn't. If people knew some of the things I've done they would not see me the same way. If they knew what I think about they would be scared of me. 

Here is a list of problems that make me feel like I should not be a participant in wider society:

-I am barely functional. I basically never clean my house or my dishes. It's all a mess. I barely take care of myself.

-I have recurring violent fantasies about people who have hurt me or that I feel aren't deserving of life. Mostly former bosses and politicians. I recognize these feelings as real and valid but also disgusting and base. I should not think this way but I want to anyways.

-I often think about my capacity for predation and the terrible things I can to do people. I often have intrusive thoughts about inappropriately touching people, but I don't feel I want to nor have I ever done so. It's like I'm just aware that I could be a predator and that fact scares me. I don't know why this happens.

-I have abused and molested multiple family pets starting in my teens. Never to the point where the animal was physically hurt, bleed, or penetrated, but I don't think that's a very important distinction. The important part is that I did those things to animals I loved. I don't fully understand why but I don't think explaining it could acquit me of the guilt I rightfully feel. This above all thing makes me feel like a disgusting monster and I would not blame anyone reading this if they told me they agreed.

-I often make my mental health struggles other people problem. I will write long self-flagelatory diatribes about how garbage I am (much like this) and send them to friends, which is not a healthy coping mechanism and put my friends in a tough and unfair position. I don't want to constantly be a burden and beat other people with my self hatred and despair. It isn't fair to them.

-Because I am a failure of a person and cannot get my shit together my parents often have to help me by sending me money or taking care of basic life tasks for me, like going to the food bank for me or getting me other necessities I cannot motivate myself to retrieve. Even if the help is readily and happily offered by my parents, I don't deserve it whatsoever. They should not assist me. They should not love me. They should not even acknowledge my existence.

-I spent a good six months last year doing nothing but playing games, watching YouTube, eating my parents food, and smoking weed. My parents completely took care of me because I was too depressed to do much of anything. I should have killed myself instead of mooching off of them and being a piece of shit.

-Im a gender confused fake tranny piece of shit. I can't make up my mind. I'm probably stealing valor from actually valid trans people. I haven't even fully persued transition out of fear of persecution in my community and because I'm just not sure yet of what I want to do. I'm ashamed of how incomplete and incongruent I feel. I can't be true to myself. I barely even know who ""myself"" actually is. I'm pretty sure I just confuse people and look and sound like a stupid mentally ill faggot. I wish someone would hate crime me out of existence.

I'm sure I could come up with more.

The point is that I should kill myself. I cannot think of myself as someone worth knowing, caring about, or loving. When my mom tells me she's proud of me it makes me upset because she must either be lieing or delusional. I am not someone to be proud of whatsoever. If I told her what I've done to the pets she would never look at me the same way again. I wish she would.jist forget about me because I'm a selfish piece of shit who doesn't want to deal with the consequences of my actions. Like I said, I should kill myself but I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do it.

Good luck to anyone who finds this post. You should honestly just tell me how garbage I am and encourage me to kill myself so I actually can go through with it.",1652877192.0
211,"How do you stop feeling inadequate in social situations where everyone else is ""farther along""/""more successful"" than you? (LONG)","I am trying so hard to redefine success - which at the core I truly believe is fulfillment/satisfaction/contentment/happiness/inner peace.

But it's hard when you come from a culture (I was born and raised in the United States but my family is of Asian descent) that highly praises and emphasizes honor, awards/accolades, academic success, big-named schools, prestige, power, popularity/fame, riches, status, meeting the stereotypical life milestones by a specific age, etc. I'm trying to break away from this mindset. I am very close with my family, but, I hate that we are part of a community that really is deeply enmeshed in this ideal if you know what I mean. Social events with other Asian folks (people my parents know and their kids who are in their late 20s/30s). I'm in my late 20s (for context), single, unemployed, and living with my parents. Graduated medical school in 2019 but have had to study for licensing exams in order to get a job in my field. These exams have given me a very difficult time. I've never been a good studier/test taker. Always been a mediocre student. I graduated at the bottom 10% of my class. I couldn't get involved in extracurriculars because I failed exams and was very overwhelmed with my rigorous program. Even repeated a year and graduated later than my friends (who are all working). Barely passed my first board and am studying to re-take another exam that I need for medical residency. It's been a difficult journey. This certainly is not how I envisioned my life post graduation. It's taking me so long to get my life together. I feel bad because my parents have supported me (financially and emotionally) throughout my entire journey and it's taking me so long to get my life together. I have heard them a couple times comparing me to other girls my age: ""Look! so and so is your age and almost done with medical residency and she's ready to start her fellowship. She's pregnant with her second child."" or, ""When are you going to hurry up? So and so already has interviews for residency programs.""

I want to be a child psychiatrist more than anything though. I'm just frustrated it's taking longer than I hoped. And besides being a practicing doctor, there is SO MUCH else I want to do in life (publish a book, get into flower design, start a podcast, candle-making, travel, etc.)

But I feel self-conscious and even inadequate about my station in life sometimes. While I do appreciate the time and freedom I have (because of the lack of responsibilities), at social gatherings, people ALWAYS ask what I'm up to. I feel inadequate compared to the other girls my age who are established doctors in training/lawyers/aspiring business magnates/politicians/diplomats/etc. who have gone to or are working for prestigious institutions/programs. Some even married and also with kids. While I have none of that at the moment. A few of the girls are honestly really mean to. They pry and ask about what I'm doing, when I'm applying to residency, what I've been doing since graduation, etc. and they lord it over me what they have - being far along in their medical training, being married, etc. In my interactions, I try not to let my upset feelings show on my face. I try and demonstrate grace congratulating them on their achievements, asking them what they like about work/their spouse/kids, etc. But I still feel bothered on the inside. I want to get to a point where I don't feel provoked by other people no matter what they do/say. I genuinely want to wish them well in their lives (even if they are jerks). Getting to that point is hard because sometimes I feel that it's not fair what they have (or that because they are shitty people that they have success in life). Really trying to get out of this frame of thinking because I'm not seeing the full picture. I know they're just projecting what they want me and other people to see. But I know genuinely wishing them well and being happy to see that they got what they wanted hits folks like this on another level. How do I stop feeling bothered?

I am very attached to my parents. This time I've had with them since I moved back home after finishing school has been precious. The other night I thought to myself: ""When am I ever going to have this amount of dedicated time with them ever again? I don't know if I ever will...life moves so fast...""

The only thing that's been helping me has been church and Bible time. I have started going recently and I feel...great every single time I go. I am reminded of the brevity of our lives. Whether a human being lives until 100 or 80 years...that is still short in light of eternity. And while I am aware of this sobering reality (and time with God has changed my perspective on what's truly important). This thought always crosses my mind when I hear news of a rich and famous person dying. They've accumulated everything and couldn't take anything with them.

It's just hard remembering this in the moment when I'm at these social functions. People are mean. They attach their worth to what you have/haven't accomplished. They attach your worth to your career/other external measures of success. I have started to realize that it's an individual's heart and character that carries them far, isn't it? It's really sad how the world doesn't see it that way.

The day after Christmas I have to attend my niece's birthday party. It's a family event so I HAVE to go. Along with extended family are other people (like the ones I have described who will be there). I'm already feeling anxious about this day coming (I'm kind of ashamed to admit it).

212,Some low hanging fruit,"Just wanted to offer a small bit that's helped me.

* Drinking 64oz water a day

* A multi vitamin

When I get in really depressive episodes I completely stop taking care of myself. I won't eat for days. I don't shower or brush my teeth for a week straight. It's a dark pit. We all know how that feels.

I'll sit in my bed, on my phone, googling ""getting over depression tips."" The articles always say shit like ""go for a two mile walk!"" ""Hang out with friends!"" And all I can think is ""yeah fuck that. I can barely get out of bed unless I have to go to the bathroom. I've been wearing the same shirt for 4 days.""

But I'll swear by drinking water and taking a multi vitamin. Does it cure my depression? Hell no. But what it does do is give me just enough. *Just enough* energy to shower. I feel *just good enough* to walk down the block.

Wanted to write this because maybe there's someone else out there like me sitting there right now, in bed, on their phone. Maybe this helps them. Maybe it gives you just enough to progress to the next step.

I showered today. I even flossed.

213,"for the first time in my life, as a chronic people pleaser, i'm building back up my self-esteem and standards - it feels weird. I almost feel like an asshole.","
When I had my recent depressive episode, I put such large value on the people around me. I suppose it can partially be because of a low view of myself - I was scared of my utilitarian worth, and was in a long ethical debate with myself about whether suicide would in the long run be a more altruistic action than living on and possibly bringing harm. But being on new meds, I'm beginning to once again realize my self worth as a human being, and the fact that only those who put in any effort, or by whatever situational reasonings, deserve any sort of benefit that I can provide - no matter how haphazard my being is.  because it's mine, and it's amazing. (idk if my mood will crash down later.)

I really don't know what I should be these days. I've read individualist and communist thinkers. I've worried myself about being a narcissist. But I suppose I haven't found my personalized balance. Even my 'selfless' mindset perhaps has shifted the power dynamics between me and other people. btw I'm still going to school for social work because I believe those who ask for help deserve it.

But it feels weird. I'm used to seeing always seeing the good in people. No matter how aware of their flaws I am, I see a human beauty in them. I've had such a low view of myself recently that I'm still uncomfortable accepting the fact that some people just don't deserve whatever I can offer.

 something that fucked me up recently was about this girl I liked (and inexplicably still do) for a long while, an unresolved memory that i carried in my mind even after years in between and tinder dates etc. but only now i'm realizing that it's not me who has to prove my worth, which in a way i've been trying to do recently. tho i admit there were things that were my fault - i've have a recurring worry that i hurt her before. (based on plausible deniability + avoiding overestimating my place in other's lives, i don't think i'll ever know for sure, but i'd owe her if she ever needed anything from me.) this bizarre dynamic has left me feeling weak, me trying to give something back that no one even wants.

i don't deserve to feel bitter about people - no one has necessarily done me any immense wrong - but it feels so pathetic of me to put myself in such fragile positions.

i'm sick of the people pleaser persona i've been brought up to have. i can tell when people don't understand me, or when my mocked up image is working. only my dad and anonymous twitter political posts truly know how much of a jaded asshole i really am. i'm realizing now that that part of me has been sorely restricted. of course, i'll let that out only to some extent - i have my career path and idealized line of ethics - but man, i don't want to suck up to anyone anymore.

(idk how my brain works, but since writing this I've crashed into emptiness/restlessness again.)",1612582770.0
214,I HAD A JOB INTERVIEW!!,"This is not a major story or accomplishment to most, but as someone who suffers from chronic depression and anxiety, on top of a bad shoulder injury and this entire Pandemic, this was a huge step for me. 

I have a full-time job with a major theme park that I actually really enjoy, and it helped pull me out of a horrific depressive slump when I got hired there. I also have a career path with them and the opportunity to move into some really amazing jobs (but the Pandemic had put a but of a hold on that). 

At the start of 2020 I tore a muscle and tendon in my dominant shoulder that prevented me from being able to work, this happened at home so I did not qualify for workers comp. I have been on Medical Leave from my job for 8 months now and this Pandemic hasn't made me all that excited to return, I have to return by Feb 2021 in order to guarantee my job. HR told me I could try and work a temp. job elsewhere until I'm healed enough to return so I started job hunting. I had an interview a month or so ago with a Spa as a front desk person that went well but they didn't want to hire someone for just a few months, I also hated the idea of working with the public (it's a huge anxiety trigger for me). I kept applying for jobs I felt I could do with my injury and finally came across a Product Photographer position with very little info. in regards to what I'd be doing. I applied on a whim and got invited to interview with them today. I was having an anxiety attack about it the last couple days to the point that I almost bailed on the interview. I have been scared to return to my job but even more scared about the possibility of starting a new job, even if it's just temporary and possibly hating it. It's a start-up company/small business and I've worked for several small businesses in the past, but I've had mostly terrible experiences with these types of companies so the thought of that happening again has been making me insanely stressed out.

So, today was my interview and I couldn't find the building, I drove around and around, parked, panicked a lot and nearly bawled my eyes out from the stress, finally I started knocking on random business doors and found the place I needed to be, it's in a large shared building that's basically a warehouse and not for the public. The guy doing my interview was laid back and chill, the other business owner was out sick so only having one person to deal with made things a lot easier for me. I started feeling really good once we started talking and got to ask questions, have discussions, and felt heard. I now really hope I get this job as it pays decent, the hours seem really good, and I'd be away from people and crowds and working on my own. I'm now having a reverse anxiety attack worrying about them not hiring me, but that's better than how I was feeling before that that's an improvement.",1601664105.0

*I like you as you are,*

*Exactly and precisely.*

*I think you turned out nicely*

*And I like you as you are*

It's just that I got so used to feeling unlovable, not worthy of anyone's affection (even my own), that these words shook me the to the core.

216,"I had a bad week, but that's ok","I've been beating myself up the past couple days for not having a productive week, and for letting anxiety and depression get the best of me a little bit. My depression has gotten worse recently, like often happens in the winter, and my work has really suffered. I accomplished almost none of the things I set out to do this week.

But it got me thinking, my ""bad weeks"" now are SOOOO much better than my bad weeks just a few years ago, it's like night and day. Even though I didn't get much work done this week, I still accomplished a lot:

- I worked out at least a little every day
- Grocery shopped
- Cooked myself healthy meals
- Cleaned
- Researched a topic I've been meaning to learn more about
- Read
- Played music and learned some new songs
- Spent time with friends and family

A bad week just 2 or 3 years ago would have meant me alone for days at a time, physically sick from anxiety, crying and having panic attacks, and drinking alcohol to numb myself at night.

So I think I'll cut myself some slack. I still don't feel great, but that's ok, I'll have better weeks. Instead of let myself fall into a spiral of guilt and anxiety, I'm going to take some time for myself, make a plan for next week, and try again.

217,"My way of breaking down the negative thoughts, by simplifying (on a biological level) my understanding of WHY exactly I am thinking this. You need to recreate your emotions.","Our brain makes links between data stored in it. 
It can also link data to emotions. So if a thought is associated with a negative emotion, there is a physical chemical pathway between those two bits of data. So, to change your emotion about something you must form a new link to a different emotion. To completely change the way you feel about something is hard. as you have to break the channel made by the brain. This channel is strengthened by reinforcement- connecting the data and the same emotion. The more you feel that emotion with that data the more the connection is reinforced. 

Hypothesis is: the longer you have suffered with feelings of depression connected to a certain stimulus or memory, the harder it is to break that connection down. 

The only thing you can do is try to associate the stimulus (giving you negative thoughts) to positive emotion. Once you have formed that small connection, you have to convince yourself to believe it and to do this regularly so you can reinforce this new positivity enducing stimulus. The more you believe in the positive (+) connection than the negative (-) connection the more the + connection is reinforced and the more the - Connection is broken (however it will never completely dissapear). Essentially you can change the balance of your mind to permanently having more positive thoughts, however it will always experience negativity. To beat it you have to be motivated to fight these negative thoughts as quickly as possible. Anxiety stops you from finding motivation to do this. Sufferers of depression hence often struggle with anxiety too. Essentially to 'relax' is the opposite of being anxious. So relaxing in essence is an anxiety inhibitor. 

Relaxing therefore, is a key to being able to think more positively and clear your head of negativity.

I understand that in essence the points I've made of the causes of depression and anxiety are already known, I think this provides a bit of a more in depth break down of WHY exactly 
 certain methods help in fighting depression.

f people could understand why, maybe it makes the method of fighting easier.

Fuck I think that's all, really hope that makes sense. I know there are so many more dimensions to depression than this and to suggest that this is the perfect recipe to healing is ridiculous.  I personally find it a helping hand in dealing with depressive thoughts. ",1546738096.0
218,"I had the strongest episode of depression of my life for 6 months and I disappeared from all my friends. I apologized, told them the whole truth and now nobody wants to talk to me. I need advice on what to do. They're very important to me.","Very long story short, I pushed away my friends for 6 months this year because I was living the worst time of my life. I struggle with depression and anxiety for many many years, but I had never fallen so hard like this year. I was truly at the bottom. At the beginning of my episode my mother had a car accident, I had to stay strong to take care of her, then I lost my job. I was completely suicidal for several months, I even had a plan. I was drinking a lot and taking medication to numb the pain.I couldn't get out of bed, couldn't eat anything, couldn't do literally anything. At times I had to force myself to stay in bed because I was so suicidal. All I thought about was dying. I went to the ER several times because I knew if I stayed at home I would try to kill myself. Then my physical health started acting weird due to stress, I had extreme chest pain every day for several hours due to anxiety and I fainted a lot. That never happened to me before this year.

&#x200B;

I just disappeared suddenly. I couldn't talk to anybody. I stopped using social media because it gave me anxiety. I turned off the notifications on my messaging app, For a few months they sent me messages worried about me. I couldn't open and read the messages because it always gave me intense panic attacks.

I just couldn't tell the truth, they've never seen me this bad. I just wanted to hide. I couldn't ask for help even though I  needed it so much, I couldn't talk to them and tell them the truth about how bad I was, I was afraid and mostly I was ashamed. I felt like a complete failure. I didn't want anyone to know I was that bad.

&#x200B;

It was like my depression kept me paralyzed for all these months. So much that I couldn't even face my friends and talk to them. I don't remember a lot of all these months because I dissociated badly nearly every day.

I remember thinking I just needed some time to myself, then 6 months passed and I don't even know how, it's bizarre. I was so depressed I lost the track of time completely. I was waiting to feel less shitty to talk to them, but this moment never came, because I never had such a strong and long episode like this.

&#x200B;

So yesterday I found out that a few of my friends unfriended me on facebook and I was no longer a member of our group chat. I sent long messages to everyone telling the truth about what happened to me, apologizing and asking if we could talk. 8 friends total (they're all friends with each other). No one sent me a word back.

&#x200B;

My anxiety is through the roof and I feel like total shit. All these months I felt an immense amount of guilt for not being able to reach out to them and now this guilt is even bigger. I feel like they don't want anything to do with me anymore.

I've been friends with them for about 3 years. I told them everything, I was honest about all the bad stuff, even the suicidal part. I told them the ugly truth because I couldn't have them thinking that I no longer cared about them. They are all extremely important to me and I never forgot about them (I also told them that. All the things I'm writing here, I told them).

&#x200B;

They are the only friends I have and I don't know what to do. I'm writing this in the middle of the night because I can't sleep, I'm extremely anxious and worried that I lost all of my friends.

Please, I need advice on what to do. I just want to make things right and be better. Thank you very much.",1537165424.0
219,First anniversary of “the day I should have died” coming up. Coping advice?,"I almost died. Or so I was told. I don’t remember the accident at work. I only remember waking up two weeks later in the hospital completely bald (female) with staples in my head. Being told I had had a fourth of my skull off for a week and that the passion (my job) I loved most, I had messed up at and was actually what almost killed me. I was in a wheel chair from broken pelvis/one leg and trapped in an awful rehab.

I was told I would never be able to go back to work doing what I loved if I’d even be able to work at all. I was told I was permanently damaged goods, and that my brain might never work to what it might have been able to. I was told to wait years before even pursuing my hobbies again. My adulthood was yanked away and all control given back to my abusive mother. However, my stubbornness and determination proved them all wrong. 

I have been back to my hobby now for almost 9 months and back to work for 7. I am a full time single mom again with full control of my life and child care again. I have come to terms with much of what occurred. I have overcome the night terrors, the loss of faith in myself, ect. In fact I found my life philosophy by reading books and feel that I am better for it all now. Through our weakness comes our strength. My therapist has helped a lot and I thought I was healed. 

I didn’t expect to feel this way when this time of year rolled around. I remember this time of year last year and just how great certain things were and how I had no idea that EVERYTHING was about to change. Yet, this entire little season is becoming a struggle, to punch away the negative thoughts that I thought I had finally let go of. I requested the “day” off. Ideas on what to do that day?? 

A strange part of me wants to go back to that awful rehab hospital and see it in my healthier state, and show those young therapists how wrong they were. Another part of me doesn’t know what I should do that day. Another weird part of me finds it strange I felt the need (and creepy superstition) to request the “day” off when I feel the MONTH last year was stolen from me. Not just the day. Deep down a part of me is happy to hit this year mark, as my hair is slowly growing back and I’m putting it behind me. Yet, like I said I just wasn’t expecting this reaction...

225,"Anyone who is no longer depressed but unable to really be ""energetic""?","I'm 25M and I had my worst times with depression/suicidal ideation about 3-4 years ago and once again about 1-2 years ago. I have successfully made it out of the worst now. However, I don't feel I have a personality or real interests.

I am not socially awkward. In fact, I have a decent number of friends IRL and a bunch of colleagues at work who I talk to regularly. However, I feel something is wrong because of the following things:

1. I am unable to make small talk. The problem is that I don't really care about other people at all. A lot of people are really nice to me but I don't really care about any of them and I don't know why. I used to care a normal amount but not anymore.
   1. ***Example:*** *My Mom came back from a trip back to her home city and I didn't care about how her trip was. I asked her, but I did not really care.*
2. I get addicted to things easily. If I ever start a TV show or a Video game or something, I do it for hours a day. It ruins the rest of my day (for weeks until I'm done or I move on). If I am not binging something, I just browse youtube/Reddit for a long time instead and waste my time.
3. I don't get excited by anything going on around me. I know that this is not my personality and in my suicidal phase I used to have 1-3 days a month where I felt good and in those days I was excited about doing things around me like playing sports, running, working, etc.

I'm looking around at all the people around me between the age of 20 and 60 and not a single person is less energetic than me. They have something or the other they are passionate about on a personal basis. I feel like something is seriously wrong with me in terms of my lack of energy when I'm 25.

I try to keep busy with work and grad school, but it’s honestly exhausting and I always feel behind or inadequate. When I get home, I either want some escapism or sleep. Usually both. For a while, I was having a drink or two most days, but I guess that’s just another way to try and numb everything out.

I’m not sure what to do. It’s hard to stay present and see a purpose in doing much of anything. I don’t see anything fulfilling about how my life is going to go. I can’t cope with the thought of my life just being an endless cycle of working, eating, sleeping, and paying bills.",1648437753.0

**Childhood Trauma**

BOOKS

*\*Homecoming by John Bradshaw* \- Takes you step by step through the stages of childhood development.  Helped me pinpoint which needs weren't met, so I could start to grieve and find ways to provide those needs for myself. The meditative exercises might be too much for someone on their own, however.

*Running on Empty by Jonice Webb* \- Takes you through *how* emotional neglect happens in childhood, and how it can continue to affect you into adulthood, even if your parents were well-meaning.  Some of the exercises in this book were literal game changers for me in understand what emotions actually ARE and how to meet them/cope with them.

**General Trauma**

BOOK

*\*Healing Trauma by Peter Levine* \- Walks you through how the body stores trauma, with exercises on how to tap into it.  For me, just understanding that my body could store things was enough to really contribute to my grasping emotions as a physical as well as mental experience.  You may or may not be able to use it on your own - if you don't have severe trauma, it might be okay to do by yourself as I did.  If you have any concerns though, I would make sure your therapist knows.

&#x200B;

**Emotional Instability**

BOOK

*Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy by David D Burns* \- BOY did I wish I had found this book sooner, it would have shortened how long it took me to understand concepts of cognitive distortions.  It helped me really understand how thoughts lead to emotions, and how I could stop it.  One of the more ""this book will actually tell you what to do about it, not just what's wrong"" books. This one has helped my day to day life feel better. Also highly recommend the audiobook version.

APP

*ThoughtDiary* \- A great place to process when I don't have someone or my therapist to talk things out with.  Helps me learn to process things on my own (highly recommend listening to or reading Feeling Good first, to get a really good grasp on what cognitive distortions ARE so you can use it better).

THERAPY

DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) - I know for some this may be beating a dead horse, but DBT isn't just for people like me with Borderline symptoms.  It's definitely an ""you get what you put in"" process, and I had to do a lot of ""suspension of disbelief"" to even get myself to try, but DBT basically taught me the emotional coping skills I didn't know existed.  It brought me back down to earth, and gave me a fighting chance, even if it didn't fix everything.  I needed CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) after, but for someone who came from a really emotionally unstable environment, DBT gave me the skills I needed to function. I did the work for solid year and never missed a week.

**ADD Specific**

BOOKS

*The Gift of Adult ADD by Lara Honos-Webb* \- The first book I was ever given about ADD and absolutely helped me to feel better about how my brain works.  It unfortunately makes the conclusion that medication is kind of necessary if you want to function (unless you are in specific jobs) but overall, the most positive book about having ADD I've ever read.

*Healing ADD by Daniel G Amen* \- I love this book because it lays out, from the perspective of brain scans, the different types of ADD and ways to treat it, both naturally and with medication, and presents no judgement on either way of doing it.  A great help to me understanding my particular way of being ADD (and for me, a few months of the recommended supplements have had a MASSIVE effect, but others have said it hasn't, so of course take it with a grain of salt that it's anecdotal).

**Depression Specific**

ARTICLE

[What to Do if You Are Depressed](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge/201908/what-do-if-you-are-depressed-guided-tour) *-* A series of articles by a therapist around the idea that depression is (to be reductive) all about Behavioral Activation or Shutdown.  I found the series REALLY helpful in better understanding why I was depressed, and how I was contributing to making it worse.  At the very least, it made me recognize ways I could \*stop\* contributing to my depression. The title is linked to the overview of his articles!

**Getting on With It (When you are ready and able to make some progress in life)**

BOOKS

*Designing Your Life by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans* \- Superb way of looking at life and your goals from the perspective of designers, ie people who engineer things.  Really turned around the way I look at how people achieve their dream jobs and lives, and better strategies to explore life.  I re-listen to sections a lot when I feel stuck. If you can't afford the book, google these guys!  They have a lot of talks that get a lot of the main points across.

[Wishcraft by Barbara Sher](http://wishcraft.com/wishcraft_complete.pdf) \- First good point is that Wishcraft is available for free online!  Sher is like the anti-self help guru, who believes community is really what's between you and what you want.  Reading through this and her other books helped me realize I knew more of what I wanted than I realized, and understand my concept of true north.  Can't believe it's not as popular as things like The Artist's Way (which I also liked, but not as much). The title is linked to the free pdf!

233,Does anyone else’s body temperature get all wonky with anxiety?,"I feel like one of the worst symptoms of anxiety is my body’s inability to regulate its temperature when I’m anxious. I get cold chills. This morning I was anxious and I had to wear a sweater to work. In 35 degree weather. Then when I get into blankets or put on extra layers, I get overheated and sweat profusely.

234,I'm going to make a bare minimum plan for each day and try to follow it. Is this a stupid idea when trying to improve?,"I find some things tough to do in my life. Like eating, exercise among other things which are usually the first things put on a ""plan"". I'm never able to follow any of these because I usually plan to do like 5 things at the same time and maybe I'll not be able to do one thing and I'll feel like the effort was useless. So this time my plan is:


* Make sure I attend my classes
* Make sure I sleep enough before classes. If I have an 830 class, I need to be asleep by 1AM
* Don't use my phone before going to sleep (in bed) or right after getting up(in bed)
* Have fixed ideas of what I'm going to do when I relax. I'm often browsing the internet for no reason and I'd rather just watch a movie for a couple of hours instead and have structured breaks to some extent.
* Brushing my teeth twice a day, and rinsing my mouth after eating things in my room

While I know most of you find these things easy and I have bigger problems like loneliness, depression to combat I'm hoping that this brings some level of ""normalness"" in my life again. I don't hope for amazing things. I just want to be a normal person again.",1547120111.0
235,social anxiety (too old for this s***),"Does anyone have any experience of overcoming social anxiety as an adult? Most of the posts I see on this topic are from teenagers or 20-somethings at most, and sometimes it feels like I'm the only 'grown up' who's still struggling.

I'm 37 (i.e. way too old for this nonsense...) but in certain social situations I still experience the same stomach-churning feelings of rejection and being left out that I did when I was a kid in the playground and nobody wanted to play with me. It's so embarrassing to admit to this.

I've developed a pretty solid coping mechanism, which is to avoid any situation that provokes these anxieties. This is  effective in hiding my insecurities from the world and appearing normal-ish, but it also means that I don't get a chance to build up my confidence and shift my thinking.

Is there anything I can do, or do I just need to learn to live with it?",1531257203.0
236,"Boyfriend's depression is overwhelming me, I don't know what to do anymore.","I apologize if this isn't the right place to post, I just don't know where to turn. My s/o and I have been together for 5 years and have known each other since elementary school. I love him so much: he is kind, he listens, he's opinionated yet understanding. My family loves him, we live together- our lives are very intertwined.


I became aware of his depression and anxiety when we were in our early teens. He struggles with feelings of inadequacy, sadness, social anxiety and general anxiety. His mom is a narcissist, and frequently praises her other children while simultaneously putting down my s/o. He is the VP of a start up company that is not doing well. He has not been paid in months. He also opened up to me a few years ago and told me that he was molested as a child. I have never told this secret to anyone, and I honestly feel extremely guilty for even writing it down. 


Sometimes, he seem to be quite happy. Other times, he will go for days without leaving the house, he becomes irritable, withdrawn, and stops communicating with me, his friends and his family.


I have begged him for years to get professional help, but he refuses. He saw a therapist once and had a negative experience. He is afraid of being ""drugged up for the rest of his life once they find out how messed up he is"" (his words, not mine.) I try to protect him when I notice him going through a rough day. I have missed many important events, and gone solo to many planned events because he refuses to leave the house. I don't mind missing events, it's that it pains me so deeply to see him struggle. I would happily never be invited to anything again if it meant that my s/o's pain would disappear.


I knew today was a bad day when I called him at work and he was distant and quiet. I thought I would do something to try and improve his day a bit, so I went to the office to clean his desk and keyboard (he's a big gamer and tends to game when he is feeling down). A piece of paper was folded on his desk, and I shouldn't have, but I opened it up.


I was devastated to find that he had filled up an entire page, hand-written, of things that he hated in his life. He listed many cruel things about me- my appearance, my personality, etc. He also listed a very upsetting amount of other issues: feeling like a failure, a disappointment, lack of money, etc. What really concerned me is that he wrote ""can't stop thinking about dying."" He has assured me time and time again that he would never commit suicide.


I don't know what else to do. He doesn't want to get professional help, and things are not getting better. I am always more concerned about his well-being than my own. I worry about him all day. All I want is for his pain to go away. 


At the same time, I am exhausted. I make up errands to run just so that I can sit in my car and cry alone without him knowing. I feel like I am cracking under the pressure, but I have no one to turn to. He would be horrified if people knew the extent of his depression, so I hide it from my own friends and family. I feel guilty when I feel happy.


Please, somebody tell me how to help him get through his dark days, because I am at a loss. After seeing his list...I feel like a failure, and like nothing I do to try and help him works.",1471338909.0
237,Depression stole my personal hygiene skills and I want them back,"(Throwaway because I am still dealing with a little embarrassment over this issue)
I am recovering from depression and have recently started dating again.  A few weeks ago I met someone who I would really like to continue seeing, but in the dating process it has become blatantly obvious now more than ever how severely my habits of personal hygiene have been affected during my depression.  I don't even remember how normal people do it anymore.  
I get the basics (brush your teeth twice a day and shower daily) but still have a bit of a hard time taking on these tasks.  For example: I am female, and the prospect of getting in the shower and knowing all the work I will have to do with doing my hair, picking out an outfit, etc. after I am finished seems daunting and sometimes overwhelming.   Not too long ago, I would choose to just skip showering for days, even after working out, because that was easier and ""who am I kidding anyway?"".
I am done with this.  I am very aware of how pathetic and honestly gross that is.  If anyone else can relate to this, I am looking for advice because I know I am better than that and this guy is great motivation for me to really get back that part that depression took away.
I know I need to take it little bites at a time, but I would appreciate any tips you have on personal hygiene, including habits for little things like trimming nails and such.  Please be nice, I really can't believe it has gotten to this point!",1357098789.0
238,chronic loneliness is the most pain I've felt in my life,"I (17m) have recently been struggling socially, to say the least. it has it's up and downs, but this time the loneliness is worse than anything I've ever felt before. every day feels like a desperate endless void of pleading that someone will notice me. I have no friends. I haven't hung out with anyone since July. that person seemed like my only way out of this, but I've built strong feelings for them. they are already in a relationship which I of course will respect, but the truth is it eats away at me every single day. I want to try to be friends with them, but they haven't been talking to me. last time I asked to hang out was a few weeks ago, with no response. I know I need to move on, but it makes me so angry. angry at them for not feeling the same way, but more angry at myself for not moving on. I'm more fragile than ever these days. today my teacher talked to me about missing assignments. he noticed I've been down, so he asked me who I talk to. who my friend group is. I broke down. the only words I could muster were ""haven't had something like that in a long time"". that isn't the only time either. a lot of times people will ask me about my friends or social life, and when I don't have an answer for them, I burst into tears. I hate myself for this. I hate everyone else for this too. I spend my school day in a deep hole of jealousy, followed by disassociation. when I get home, I distract myself for as long as I can until I reflect on how I didn't talk to anyone, sending me into another bout of crying. sometimes it escalates. crying turns into screaming. holding my pillow turns into throwing it across the room and hurting myself. I just want someone to notice me. my imposter syndrome tells me I just want attention, spiraling my self hatred. in fact I feel it now, telling me I'm doing this for cheap reddit karma. the days feel endless. i can't put into words the dread and hatred I feel every single day. I'm tired of being jealous of her. I'm tired of no one caring about me. I'm tired of going to bed early, not because I want to, but because I can't stand to live in my reality.

239,"I struggle with never being ""chosen""","Hi there,

I've been lurking on this page for a while now, and I just really needed support. I've been dealing with the single woman blues and am struggling with self-esteem issues.

I'm 28 years old and single, but, am far from ""strong and independent"". Aside from a job (I'm working on my career still and hoping to get a job in my field in 4-5 months. To give you specifics, I went to medical school and am trying to get into a residency program this year - a training program for doctors in a hospital).

The truth is, as much as I try to deny the desire, I really do want to be in a relationship. I can't help it. I have been single my entire life. I've never known what it's like to have been on the other side. I've never been asked out on a date either. There have always been guys I've liked, but, at best I was teased and at worst I was severely bullied by guys I've liked. These experiences have really taken a toll on my self esteem. I always struggled with the idea of being ""chosen."" ""why did he choose her and not me?"" ""I wish I had been with a guy for X years regardless of how the relationship ended because he still chose to be with me in the first place regardless of how the relationship ended."" ""I hate how my friends complain about being in toxic/unhealthy relationships because they were still chosen by a man.""

I feel like most women really don't understand how I feel because they have been in relationships before. Most women do not understand at all what it's like to not be wanted. Even if you were in a relationship, you were still chosen in the first place. It's gotten better, but it used to make me feel terribly sad and angry even.

I understand these are terrible thoughts and this is the kind of thinking that I'm so afraid of that could lead me into an abusive relationship. And I'd like to get into why I want to really reframe my thought process.

The most recent experience (which has lead to this epiphany) I've had was with the son of family friends (they are family friends of my dad's older brother and wife) - so we have known them for many years, not well though.

He's (he works in the intersection of tech/IT and finance) the son of close friends of my aunt and uncle (my dad's older brother and wife). So we've known the family for a long time. I had always wanted to meet him. His mom had always really liked me too.

So this guy was going to come over to my house and meet me. He's 31 years old and his family wanted us to be introduced to each other. I actually couldn't believe it. So the day came and he actually showed up to my house and had lunch with my family. We had time on our own to talk. We really enjoyed ourselves. He couldn't stop smiling, even significantly deepened his voice as he spoke to me (compared to the way he was talking with my family). He even wet his hair (to make it more slick after coming back from the bathroom). I had never had a man be this charming/flirtatious with me. The next day, I found out he wanted my number. It was pretty unbelievable for me that this was happening.

I will say though that my dad wasn't happy at all with this guy when he came. My dad made faces the entire time. He didn't like him at all and was adamant that I didn't stay in contact with him. My dad kept saying after that there was something off about this guy. I thought he was exaggerating. Because at the time, I received a proposal from another family (that is filthy rich) and this guy that I liked, his family is quite frugal. They have a small home and old cars). So I thought my father was just being an elitist.

So this guy and I were texting back and forth every day (this was very new to me - I had never received any kind of male attention before). Things were great and I was beginning to grow fond of him. He described himself as ""robotic, pragmatic and very rational."" He's 31 and has no friends. All of his friendships faded away (He lied to me initially and told me that had had friends all over the country when we met). He's only close to his parents and his cousin (whose like his older sister). He has an older brother who he is not close to at all. I don't think they get along (his brother lives a very boujee lifestyle, travels, eats out fairly often, and owns his own house in an expensive city)

He started asking me questions (it sort of sounded like an interview - that if it was an issue that he'd been in previous relationships, what my ideal family situation looked like - and with this he was specifically asking about how many kids I wanted, if I'd want nannies for them, what about medications, my views on our kids having a psychiatrist, etc.). I said I'd probably want a nanny (since I grew up with one) and he said he would want to have his parents watch our kids (I'm assuming to save money). He said he would work from home because he didn't believe in subscribing to traditional gender roles. I told him I would probably work part-time and he asked what about all that school I had plus exams? He then wanted to identify areas of conflict in a relationship (I just thought it was kind of odd but went along with it - this was all through text, btw). So we talked about our love languages, communication styles, etc. The biggest difference was finances. I grew up comfortable and he didn't. He said that his family was hand to mouth (but his parents did work hard) and that he never wanted to be hungry for money in his adult life. He also makes 200K+ a year and owns 3 homes, so he's doing really well for himself.

I explained to him that I go out to eat with my family once a week (I mean that's a normal thing, right?) and that when I start earning, I will spend my money how I'd like and shouldn't have to give any explanations to my partner (like treating myself within reason, or buying a nice piece of jewelry that I've been eyeing). He said that no one has to justify themselves but if one partner if saving for the children's college fund while the other is going out to eat once a week, then there is an imbalance.

The truth is, that comment did upset me a bit. I didn't understand why he would even bring imaginary kids into this when we hadn't even spent any time together yet (just the way he was going about this was bizarre - it didn't feel like a budding relationship but an interrogation). So again I explained that I was really starting to like him but I felt upset by his comment. I explained that my dad worked very hard to give me, my mom, and siblings a very comfortable life. That going out to eat was something that I'm used to and have done all my life. It was something that I was used to. I explained that my family instilled respect for money in me and that I'm not thoughtless about money or an impulsive buyer/spender. I did tell him that my dad always does take my mom out and he pampers me as well (again, this is the life I have had). I gave him a compromise....why not go out twice a month? it would be something different to do along with hiking/biking (which he really loves). I asked him: What if I wanted to spend some money on decorative items for our home or buy a lovely dress and get dolled up for myself and him? I said that since he brought up finances, then a ""yours, mine and hours"" should be discussed later, because otherwise, the line lets get blurred. I also mentioned that as long as everything else is taken care of financially, why not set aside money for things we enjoy? (along with both of us contributing to the child's college fund)

He said he would have a chance to get back to me later over the weekend, but I didn't hear from him for 4-5 days. This was unusual because we were talking everyday before this. I felt very bothered. And finally, when he did respond, didn't apologise for making me feel upset or acknowledging anything that I said. He was basically talking past all my points and asked me if I've heard of a minimalist lifestyle (but he supposedly had no intention of going all the way), asked me if I had a rainy day fund because he was still in the process of building his and will likely be for many more years. He said he was concerned about my expectations of a future partner pampering me. And with my example about buying decorative items for our home, he said I could either buy a table for 1000$ or 20,000$. When I mentioned the part about getting dolled up, he said he's known people who do things for appearances sake and wholeheartedly disagrees with this kind of thinking (I mean, who doesn't want to look good for themselves and their spouse?).

Honestly, that message sounded very patronising, judgmental, and even insecure.

So I started off with the fact that he left me hanging and didn't even send me a text. If he needed time and space, to please say so. Again I reiterated all my previous points (about setting aside money and taking care of everything financially) but explained that you don't have to cut corners. I told him that I knew how to be financially responsible since I lived on my own for a few years so I know how to budget and mind money. I told him that having a wife and kids has expenses. Going out, treating yourself, etc. That's all part of normal, healthy relationships. There's nothing wrong with pampering your partner (and I clarified that when I meant pampering, I meant not in a ""waiting on me hand in foot"" but lavishing each other with lots of love/doing/saying loving things/and occasionally buying a gift on special holidays. I said there's nothing wrong with rewarding yourself with a nice treat or enjoying a hard-earned vacation (he travels as well, but, he does a lot of solo hikes in remote places, which I think would have been fun to have gone with him). I told that I really liked him and that we keep going back and forth about this. But this whole money thing...seems like something he's unwilling to compromise on, like its a non-negotiable for him. I felt unsettled by his unhealthy relationship with money. I also brought up the fact that he only briefly glossed over what happened (actually didn't tell me anything at all when he said he'd give me some high-level points) in his last relationship (which was 2 years and ended a year ago).

I told him that this makes it hard because I liked him and I thought he was wonderful..that... I was open and willing to make this work, but, he had to meet me halfway if he felt this was a relationship worth pursuing. I asked him to help me understand him in this way and give me the same grace. That we could find an option that works for us both. I even gave him a way out if he really wanted it. I asked him if getting to know each other was what he really wanted.

He replied immediately after and said that he definitely wanted to keep talking and believed that all my concerns should be minimised. He apologised for essentially ignoring me for those few days. He told me no more excuses and that I deserve attention, respect, and respect with the level of communication. He said that my unsettled feelings (about his view of money) shouldn't be ignored and that he did not wish to cloud me with sweet nothings. He called me amazing and said he felt lucky to have met me (He even acknowledged that we really did hit it off when we first met). He said I possess strength of character, the integrity to stand up for my beliefs, and the ability to be myself (which was what he was looking for in a partner). He said that he really does enjoy talking to me and truly hoped that I felt the same.

I said that I did feel the exact same and that I meant it. All I said about the concerns I had (the previous relationship and his views about money) - I understood those were sensitive topics that we can absolutely talk about them later if he feels comfortable. I also did ask him about what made him want to pursue a relationship/marriage at this point in time. I asked him just to be honest and upfront with me (as I have been with him) instead of me thinking that maybe he's hiding something. I told him that I am eager to get to know him, etc. It was a kind message, nothing more to it.

I didn't hear from him for 3 days. and I felt extremely bothered.

He then ended it with me and I couldn't bring myself to respond. So I deleted his number. I was so upset and couldn't hold in my tears. Just the way he went about the whole thing was very disappointing. We didn't even get to spend any time together just as I was hoping. He did not give it a chance and this bothered me so much. It's not the fact that someone else won't come around or that I'll never get married. I know that's untrue, but, it's with this man specifically.

I was gracefully allowing and loving in my responses to him, with the potential for growth and evolution. I wanted to see him again. I am so distraught that he will never come back. That I will never have my chance with this person ever again when I really wanted it. There was so much more I wanted to say to him. So much more I wanted to know about him.

It bothered me because I was not asking for much at all. The bare minimum actually. I wanted to show him that I am a communicative, open, respectful, and loving individual (which I would imagine are ideal qualities in a partner). I know that I did nothing wrong. It was just....him that made me feel sad and confused. I couldn't understand why he didn't try.

I was showing his texts to my friends and they thought something was off about him - even my mom thought the same. They all thought he was being incredibly controlling and felt like I was already heading into an abusive relationship. My cousin told me to stop talking to him but I didn't listen to her. My parents called him selfish. They said if I had married him, it would have been a tragedy and he would have made my life hell. My younger brother (who is 17), asked me why i didn't have any self-respect. He said, ""You realise what he did to you, right? You know, you could have married an abusive psycho. There was something wrong with him. I can't believe you didn't see that. He actually had a long discussion with my about it yesterday as I was driving to pick up food for him. My brother also said that this guy would have ruined my life.

There was so much expectation...and hope. All of this was building up over the years, I was waiting in anticipation and that was it (this lasted for a month). I just couldn't believe that he left just like that. He didn't care. After 14 years...that was it. It's been very hard dealing with my grief. I wanted him to give me the chance to show him who I could be and it didn't happen which devastated me. It was the first time someone wanted to get to know me (something I had never experienced in my life, because I always felt like an invisible wall to men or was the target of their bullying). Then when I thought something was finally going to work out (especially with the one guy I really wanted), it didn't. It was just too good to be true. Around the time he broke things off with me, his father was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer. Then he passed away last weekend.

I have been thinking about his family. I've been turning to prayer a lot because prayer comforts me. So I've been praying for his dad and I did say that I would have loved to have been a part of his family as his daughter in law. All I wanted was to to know and love his son. I had no agenda. That was it....and now...I will never have that chance ever again with him. I wish I could have been there to even comfort his son during this time of grief and mourning if we were in a relationship.

I heard now that his mom has been introducing him to other people. After hearing that, it made me feel so bad. I felt jealous, even. It's been very painful for me. I have been waking up most mornings with a terrible ache in my chest. My dad told me I should not feel bad that he's talking to other people because I've now seen his true nature. I mean...would you all agree? Am I not missing out on much? Again, I know none of it is my fault. I just wanted to understand him and his thinking. He just left when we didn't even get a chance to explore a relationship together, which is what I was really hoping for. I can't believe he is never coming back.

Despite all this...I still agonize over it at times. I do need counselling at some stage once I am able to afford it.

You probably read that scenario and thought to yourself, ""this guy doesn't sound like he's much of a catch.""

I have always had this desire to be loved by a man. After this experience, my eyes have opened. There is something I really need to fix here. I can't keep living my life like this. I know I'm worth more. I think the only thing is...I'm terribly sad that he didn't see it.

I have so much love to give...I know I'd make a wonderful wife. I would lavish my man with with so much love and affection. I would want to nurture and pamper him as much as I can.

I know that I have many goals and dreams. Settling would be painful and (according to my friends) many women do settle for mediocrity early on in life for the fear of being alone. But I know the world needs me. I know I can do so much. I don't want to feel disheartened and held back by this. And honestly, someday, I do hope I can meet someone who can match the best version of myself (and I'm not there yet - I've got a lot of work to do). I try and reframe my thinking to be the main character of my own story. Some days I do feel inspired but most times I am always thinking about men, romance, dating...

I look at Amal Clooney who is truly amazing. She didn't settle and waited and married George! She is the definition of a badass.

Any strong, independent ladies who can shed some light on this issue? Should I feel devastated? Am I missing out? Everyone in my family says its his loss entirely. I have trouble convincing myself. I had a long lecture earlier today from my mother saying that as a woman, I need to be strong and she didn't understand what she did wrong in raising me that I turned out this way (that made me feel bad). But she's been married to my dad for 31 years and before meeting my dad she was in a relationship for 5 years with another man. So she doesn't know how I feel.

I did have a long discussion with a friend the other day, who said that as women its so important to be independent (not just financially, but emotionally, etc.) because there are no guarantees in life about anything. Your significant other could die, leave you (even for reasons not having to do with cheating, etc.) and in the end, you only have your self to pick up the pieces. You can't plan your life around a man. You just can't. I thought she did raise a valid point there.

At the same time, I know being single really does afford me so much...time and freedom.

My biggest dream actually is to become a child psychiatrist. And I want to publish a book one day (before I turn 30!), start my own podcast, go into jewelry design as well (take gemology courses), learn languages, painting/sculpture/flower pressing/calligraphy, etc. So much I want to do! I try to think of all the amazing possibilities.

I think the part that really hurts is...it's not that I'm in a rush to get married...its just I feel so sad that I've lost my chance with that guy forever. He's never coming back. I feel devastated. There was so much more I wanted to know about him and now I never will have the chance to.

I'm just tired and frustrated...I think I really need to do some reflection and self-loving...

I hope you all aren't disappointed in me. It's been such a painful experience. I am now trying to reframe my unhealthy and love-starved thought processes into completely de-centering romance and relationships (that's practically all my life). I need to find a way...

240,A few things I want to do with my life:,"1. Discover my own creative voice and improve my writing ability over time; write a novel that only I could write, then continue.

2. Work on my physical fitness until I am satisfied with my body, then continue.

3. Find a partner who is creative, vibrant and intelligent: fall in love, but without the expectation that things should last forever.

4. Finally feel confidence in myself, know who I am without doubt or despair. Stop caring what others think.

5. Live truly alone, even for just a little while. Live in the woods, in a house I built.

6. Do something I think I'm no good at; surprise others.

7. Travel, overcome fear of others and see the beauty in people, even when so many are ugly. 

8. Somehow, even it feels futile or impossible, do something good and worthwhile for the world  before I die, something that isn't cowardly or self-serving.

9. Don't rely on the outside for support: find peace from within.",1628477769.0

243,Depression is getting old. (Realized after writing this is basically just a venting post).,"I wake up earlier than I want to. I make the short commute to my job, where I just put my mind on mute so that I can get along with people for my few hours of working. I usually come home and just sleep. Today I slept for about 5 hours. Woke up to eat something. Tried playing a video game, got annoyed, just kinda sat and existed in a grey haze. Getting ready to go to bed and repeat tomorrow. The next day. The next week. Who knows how long. 

It’s getting old. I realize what this is. I’m well acquainted. I’ve been fighting this for about 10 years now. I started seeing a doctor and counselor when I was relatively young. I still do. But really, it’s all become just an annoyance. Another thing I don’t want to do. 

I’m lost. It’s not new. I’m not sure what to do about it. Medicine? Tried it. Counseling? Tried it. Family? Not a chance. Friends? It’s not great. I have goals and dreams and ambitions. I have hobbies and a sense of humor. I have a life and it feels absolutely buried. I’m just constantly angry and guilty and overwhelmed by the pure amount of energy it takes to exist in such a state. I don’t want to live like this, but I really don’t want to give up. I don’t have a reason I can identify beyond pure spite for breaking my own self-promise to keep going anyway. 

I keep trying to change things but I cannot stop this sense of just being stuck in a giant machine that returns me to systems I don’t want to participate in. I hate playing the politics of my job. My friends don’t do jack. I recently met my bio family after searching my entire life and learned the vast majority are dead or want nothing to do with me. I don’t have a partner or best friend to rely on or enjoy time with. Being awake sucks and I don’t like sleeping. I’m just venting now. 

I’m not going anywhere but I’m miserable, and I can’t say that at home anymore. Parents are wonderful people but really and truly do not understand depression. And my siblings take up most of their attention anyway. It would take them days to realize I wasn’t here if I left. I want to be here but I don’t know why I am or what I’m doing. I’d like to matter to people in my life, I’d like to share my goals and efforts, I’d like to be a better person. 

I might try and make a more focused post later but I’m too tired for that right now. I just sleep and sleep and get more tired. And I’m over all the meetings and changes and appointments. It’s too much effort for a life I’m not enjoying. This is cool, I guess. 

I want to change. I’ve been trying most of my life. And when I do, I want to help others that suffer too. I don’t want other people to feel so alone.",1620107592.0
244,"How can two depressed people be in a successful relationship, support and help each other?","Me and partner both deal with depression among other things. It's a double edged sword, because while it brings some understanding of each other that would never be possible otherwise, it also is like two people in deep water that can't swim.

How can we help each other when we can't help ourselves? We definitely try. Some times less than others. But bringing each other down (not on purpose) is so much easier than the other way around. All you have to do is exist, and it happens. And to help we can put huge amounts of effort and it barely makes a difference. It's discouraging and easy to give up even as a healthy person, let alone a depressed one.

I'm a pretty sensitive person, so even a wrong tone of text can bring me down.

Also as depressed person, I think it can be very difficult to show appreciation for any efforts, which I'm sure is something that's very important.

I would like to change that and learn how to have a better dynamic, but I don't know where to start. Especially when I can't even get out of bed 80% of the time, or have energy to make food or take a shower. I know it's all a downward spiral and I would like to stop it before it's too late.

I know that things can't be like they are if two mentally healthy people are in a relationship, but I would still like us to get better, one step at a time, ideally together. We both are seeing a therapist already.",1609774251.0

249,Can’t get over my cat passing away.,"Around mid February my 13 year old cat had to get put down because of a kidney tumor. It was so unexpected and out of nowhere and I’m still not fully over it. Every single day it would jump up onto me to wake me up and it would follow me around and never leave my side. It got over excited just being around me, I’ve never seen another cat act like that, it was as if she acted like a puppy. I knew I would struggle but not this much longer after, I thought I would feel rotten for a week then move on. Every time I see a picture of her or she gets mentioned I just can’t stand it. I got so attached to that cat, being around her 24/7 for that many years causes that I suppose. She was called ‘Patches’, because of her coat, she had a white underbelly, chin and toes, but she had ginger patches all over her. She also had a really distinctive meow that I will never forget. I never want to own a pet again after that kind of heartbreak, her sister Tigger is still alive and I honestly don’t know how I’ll cope when she passes.

250,I had my teenage years stolen from me.,"I \[21M\] was homeschooled my entire life. I live in a remote area in the woods far away from most other people. So basically it's been me, my brother and our parents. I didn't get to be a teenager. I wasn't allowed to live, experience life and grow. I've been trapped in my own house like I'm a prisoner locked up for a crime I didn't commit.

I wasn't taught how to drive because it was too dangerous. I didn't get to play any sports because I wasn't athletic. (But how would they know if I had never even tried.) I haven't learned how to fail, to make a mistake and get back up from it. I have been so sheltered that I don't even know if what I've been doing the last 21 years counts as living.

I've never had a relationship, never kissed anyone or been on a date. I hear people say they regret having sex young, that they wish they had chosen to wait. Or that if you have chosen to wait, that's something you should be proud of, not ashamed. But I didn't get a choice, in anything. It was all chosen for me. I've never had sex, done drugs or gotten drunk. Maybe I wouldn't have chosen those things anyways. But I don't know, I don't know what I would have done. I'm not sure I even know who I am. Because my chance to find out was stolen from me.

I'm finally escaping this prison and moving to college next month. But all this has messed me up so much. I'm sad, angry, depressed, confused and it feels like there is this hole inside me.

254,"I’m severely depressed, but realize it’s temporary & I’ll feel better again soon.","I’ve had bipolar 1 for over a decade now. Depression used to feel like the end of the world. But the last major depression I had I managed to live through with the whole-hearted belief that it will end in a few weeks and I’ll be myself again. Doing the same with this depression.

I think one of the worst parts of a depressive episode is how it tells you you’ll always be depressed now, it will never end.

That’s just a lie though. And I’m finally able to logically disagree with it even when severely depressed.

So, I’m just letting myself slow down. Letting my body and mind rest until it feels better again. Pushing myself to do a little something each day, along with eating and hygiene, but not freaking out about it- not trying to end it right away, induce mania instead, or end my life to end the depression.

I’m just riding it out. I know it’ll end soon. In the meantime, just trying to take care of myself and forgive myself for anything I can’t do right now. I will get everything together again when the depression ends. Which it will. I know it will because it always has. Simple as that.",1545756884.0

It feels like a variation of workaholism and in the moments I'm not working on a passion I'm either plagued with depression and anxiety or I'm waiting for the next ""high"" when I can just work on these things I like. I thought maybe self love is putting myself first, but then I get anxious over what others think of me when I do things I want, regardless of what they want from me.

258,Mental health is a lot like physical health - an analogy by Mark Freeman,"*Let's say I feel pain in my knee when I'm running, which persists even when I stop. I feel the pain the moment I wake up in the morning. That pain begins to interfere with everyday activities and eventually I can no longer do many of the activities I love doing and associated with my identity. I probably go to a doctor or talk with a more experienced runner. They might give me some tips or, in the case of the doctor, prescribe me something to relieve the pain, but I bet they would focus on why I'm experiencing that pain. It could be my gait, or how my foot hits the pavement, or the shoes I'm wearing, or maybe it's because of that time I fractured my ankle in a karate tournament as a teenager but didn't go to the doctor or tell anybody that my foot turned purple. Something I'm doing, or something that's happening, or something that's happened to me in the past has led to the experience of that pain. Whatever it is, I need to look beyond the immediate pain and make changes around the problem(s) leading to that pain if I want to get back to exercising and functioning the way I want to function. I might have to unlearn how I've been running for years. I might have to work with a therapist doing intense, often painful exercises to rehabilitate the knee and learn healthier ways of running*

259,Wanted to share my story of how my depression eventually passed. Nothing is permanent.,"Hello all, I'm a young human in the grand scheme of things but hopefully this can help someone. This has just been my brief experience so far. 

I grew up in an abusive environment, so I've always dealt with mental health issues. At 14, I really advocated for myself and was able to get out of the situation. 

From then on, things only got better. I was required to see a therapist, but my PTSD which we worked on was never debilitating. From 14-16 I had good friends, and was making really great grades. I was happy. My teachers saw a bright future for me, and I was so excited to finally put the past behind me. 

Last year though, when I turned 17 and when I was a high school senior, it all fell apart. My PTSD got significantly worse, and all of my memories of the abuse came back out of nowhere. I totally withdrew from my friends, but I was truly convinced that they hated me. I was unable to do any kind of homework anymore, and my teachers (god bless them) started giving me C's for turning in nothing, hoping that I could pull it together. Eventually, I started skipping school most days and instead laid in bed. 

Finally, I was pulled out of school and put into a partial hospitalization program. I felt horrible. I was convinced that I was worthless and that I had ruined my dreams of college. In the mean time, I had so much that I had to work through regarding my memories and my experience of what happened to me. 

I returned to school for a bit, but attended an after school group therapy. Eventually though, I was getting worse, and I was again pulled out of school for another partial hospitalization. 

Finally, in March of my senior year I had had enough. I lost one of my closest remaining friendships, and it sent me into a suicidal tailspin. I was hospitalized for three days because I was a danger to myself. It was honestly horrible but it probably saved my life. When I got out of the hospital, the world seemed so vibrant, new and beautiful. I had barely been outside for those three days, and I'd been confined to two floors of a building, and constantly monitored. I had so much freedom now, and it helped my perspective shift to a place of gratitude. 

As the school year came to a close, things got a little better. Again, I went through partial hospitalization. However, I did return to school. For the last month I was able to do schoolwork. I did SO much makeup work that month. I probably graduated only because of my reputation as a good student from the years prior. I will forever be thankful to my high school and the teachers in it, who knew I wasn't stupid but just sick. I owe them so much. Things improved with my friends, and a lot got put into perspective as people started to plan for after graduation. 

I eventually got into an average state school, with an great arts program. Despite my blunders of senior year, I still even got a small scholarship. My prior grades really carried me through. 

The summer was rough, but it was doable. I was able to function with only a weekly visit to my therapist, which was a huge deal for me. I finally found the right combination of meds. I was still horribly depressed and would cry in parking lots and such, but I wasn't suicidal. I started hanging out with friends again. I was looking forward to college. I turned 18. 

The last semester has been great. I passed with a good GPA, and I feel like my old self again. I made friends, and even started dating someone. Life is so short and fragile that chose to study something I love. As long as I can get out of bed, do my assignments, and can be close with a couple people, then I am overcome with joy. As long as I have my mental health back, then the rest doesn't matter. I am so glad that I didn't kill myself. 

This semester the depressive thinking has been creeping back a little, but now I know what to do. Instead of browsing the internet alone in bed, I go do it in a cafe. I discuss my bad feelings with my friends, family, and SO, and receive and believe in their support. I take my meds religiously. I stay organized with my homework by keeping a planner. I've started to exercise. I clean my room. I shower and eat regularly. I've started to get involved with two student organizations. I reach out to others and make plans. I ignore the evil voice in my brain telling me everyone hates me, because I have enough experience to know it's wrong. 

I am thankful for my life.

260,I did something that helped me with my depression and social anxiety!,"After a particular somewhat awkward and rushed conversation at work that resulted in someone being curt and walking off, I repeated this mantra, ""no one's judging you"" by the 7th time I felt better and by the 10th I felt almost back to normal.

261,I Finished My Laundry,"It seems like such a simple thing. But for the first time in six months, there is no more laundry to do in my apartment.

When I'm depressed, I stop doing most of my household chores. My husband and I end up with two different tiers of laundry. There's the ""closet laundry"" and then ""essential laundry."" Essential laundry gets done all the time. Socks, underthings, and our work uniforms. Closet laundry is everything else. And it just gets shoved in the closet and waits and waits and waits until I get the gumption to do it.

Eventually, that pile becomes so overwhelming I can't do anything about it.

But even though it took me two weeks and sixty dollars worth of quarters to get through it all, it's done. I not only got through all the laundry, I washed all the bedding in the apartment, including the spare sheets that had gotten sorta musty hanging out in the closet for so long and the couch cushion covers and all four of the rugs in the apartment. 

So take a look at one of your chores. You can do it, too! If I can get through washing practically every washable thing in my apartment that belongs to both my husband and myself, I'm sure you can do that load of laundry or wash that sink of dishes. You can clean up that desk. You can take out the trash. If I can do it, you can do it, too!

262,"I am a spoiled, lazy, self-indulgent child in a woman's body","I'm new to this but the rules seem relatively straightforward, so here goes nothing:

When I was in high school and even in college I did very well academically. I was always tracked into honors or dual enrollment courses, in gifted programs, etc. School was ridiculously easy for me, and I paid very little attention but enjoyed the accolades, because trust me they weren't exactly pouring in from the other areas of my life. 

I went off to an expensive and prestigious university and within a year had lost my scholarship. When faced with the real world, I would rather bury myself in chemicals than actually attend courses. I decided to take time off from school for a few years to ""get my head together"" which basically amounted to developing a terrible substance abuse problem. 

I managed to graduate from college in that period, somehow...and later I got clean and stayed clean. Something I am eternally grateful for, as many people never get this lucky. I have been clean over 5 years and in the last 2 I have finally found meds to help with my extreme anxiety and depression, that sometimes borders on mania and in extreme cases, hallucinations.

It's been a tough road, but I laid the path myself...I just find myself in the most menial fucking jobs and I sit here, harassed by my immediate supervisor sending resume after resume out to every job in my area that I am remotely qualified for and some that I am clearly not. Just good lord, get me out of here.  I have always had this problem with drive, with follow through. I cannot seem to get off my ass and do something about a situation until I am so miserable it is making me physically fucking ill. 

My job is fucking mind-numbing. I am ridiculously overqualified and I'm underpaid and I feel fairly certain that if necessary I could train a chimp or a mentally challenged 12 year old to handle the rote tasks I complete in 20 minutes during my day. My anxiety is mounting and I sit staring at the screen thinking ""oh my god, I am going to die or I am going to cry if I don't get out of here"" I literally sit here and blink back tears most of the day. 

Unfortunately, whilst this is going on, the rest of my life depends on this hell on earth I must attend 40 hours weekly. I am the primary breadwinner in my household that consists of me, my boyfriend, a dog, a cat, and sometimes his little boy. I am up to my eyeballs in debt, my chest is tight and I feel like I cannot breathe. Our lease is up in a month and the landlord's attempting to price gouge us...there is no way I will make more money at work - or I could stand working more hours. All I can do, my only reprieve is my writing and the endless array of resumes and applications I submit everyday...like tiny seeds of hope. Like a light at the end of the tunnel...that I am so desperately afraid is a mirage. I walk/run/drag myself towards the light but I'm sure I won't make it there. Instead I will collapse right here in the tunnel...and drown in a puddle of my own self loathing. FUCK.",1366733609.0
263,I can't get over how much time I have already lost,"I remember being a teen, 19 or so, and I was having a fight with my close friend, and she told me ""You didn't get better"".

I am now 26, and I still feel this phrase - in my core. I truly did not get better. I still am where I was - only more depressed, with more lost opportunities and regrets, and perhaps a more twisted, broken mind.

I haven't found a job I like. I am still single - perpetually, shamefully single. I still live with my abusive mother. No matter how much abuse I am under, no matter how cruel she is to me - I still keep being a good girl, doing exactly what she expects of me, keeping resentment down.

I have wanted to get out for so long! And yet, despite having all the resources to do that, I did not do it. I am still here.

And now that I am 26 - I can't get over how much time I have already lost. Can you imagine? All these years, the prime time of my life, I just kept sitting at home, experiencing abuse, just staying silent in hope for what - a quiet evening?

In a way, it stops me from acting now - because, really, what is the point of it now? I have already lost so, so much time. I feel powerless and broken. I resent myself.

I have reached this threshold where it is totally not normal to be me, to act like me. I started losing friends - they say to me that I should have done something about my life ages ago - and yet, I did not!

I get that, logically, the best course out is start acting now, because - well, however much I want, I cannot change the past. And yet - can you imagine? Having a life, and throwing it away like that... Precious years, all gone. Opportunities, lost.

I desperately want to change my thinking, my outlook on life - and yet the more I try, the worse I become? Does it even make sense?",1669398263.0
264,Switch off your autopilot - it's difficult to change your life when you're unhappy and stuck in a rut but the place to start is in your awareness of the little choices in every moment you make without thinking,"We go through our world, so used to making the same choices again and again, that it becomes very difficult to change things when we’re unhappy. But if we train ourselves to stop regularly, to be present and consciously make good choices rather than being on autopilot we can transform our suffering. 

A bit of regular practice like a guided meditation is important - but you can also stop for a moment a few times through the day,  notice your breath, become aware of what you can feel in your body, what you’re thinking and feeling. Training yourself in this way helps to raise awareness of the choices we have.

In mindfulness we call the decisions we make ‘watering the seeds’. These everyday choices can contribute to our anger, our happiness, our fear - just in the same way that if you choose to water certain plants in your garden, you’re choosing what your future garden looks like. Being aware of decisions and prioritising your wellbeing as the most important factor makes a huge difference over time. Peace in oneself, peace in the world.

266,Does anybody else get stressed out over completing small tasks? Any theories as to why and any remedies?,"Like  calling my health insurance place makes me go from 0 to 100 in terms of  stress levels even though the customer service rep was really polite. I  honestly don't know why.  Having to do ""adult"" things like going to the  bank, making appointments, having deadlines and schedules to things,  everything really stresses me out, even though it's objectively not a big deal and completely doable.

I  feel like I use to be able to handle it better, but nowadays it's like I  anticipate the worst and get really amped up over things that were just  fine.

I've looked at executive functioning issues, and that kind of feels like it might fit.

But  the other theory I have is that I'm just so use to unreasonable people who purposely make everything difficult, yelling at/berating me  for asking questions and talking to me like everything is a bother, and it's like I  have a physical reaction to anticipating that where my anxiety level  spikes up and I'm sitting there with my hand on the hilt if you will,  ready for someone to attack, and I get stressed out even if everything  went fine since not everyone is like the people who I know who are so emotionally unstable as to do that.

What do you think?   Do those sound like reasonable theories?  Any other reason why little  tasks can feel like a giant mountain to be moved at times? Any way to  cope with this?",1580417386.0

I just failed my life today. I had one thing to do to not be fired of my school : attend the final exam.

270,FYI: This guy they called “The Buddha” came up with an effective way to permanently cure misery. I highly recommend it.,It’s a practice or way of life with 2 main components: 1. Moral behavior. 2. Meditation. So all you have to do is just make sure that your actions are consistently moral and then do a regular practice of just sitting still and being aware of reality moment to moment. These two things together have powerfully transformed my life and that of millions of others. I hope that whatever barriers may have prevented you from finding the healing that you need are destroyed and you find lasting peace and happiness.,1652358809.0
271,The reason clever people have poor mental health: their model of happiness is fed with faulty assumptions,"Why doesn’t being clever make you happy? Raj Raghunathan, who is a professor in The University of Texas, wrestled with this question in his recent book. The conclusion that he came to was that while smart people are good at achieving, they make misjudgements about how that success will will translate into happiness. He found that a lot of the friends he went to school with were distracted and miserable.

This makes sense when we view the mind as creating models of how the external world works. Like statistical models or meteorological models they can be very complex - but if you feed the wrong assumptions and data into them it doesn’t matter how complex the methodology is, you’re going to get the wrong answer out the other side.

So if the intellect goes off the rails when fed poor assumptions, what are the fallacies? Smart people get told from an early age that they need to achieve, need to maximise their potential if they want to be happy. This is not completely wrong - one of the things that contributes to our happiness is doing things we enjoy and work is a big part of that. But this can’t come at the cost of building human relationships and developing our own sense of being. And it frequently does. When we’re analysing and working for future happiness we’re not in the only place we can be happy, which is here and now.

Another fundamental error is to see life as an optimisation problem, that can be solved. Unfortunately its not as analytical as that - happiness comes from living through our senses, letting go of the things we’re attached to, enjoying the world in front of us and being aware of our thoughts without getting involved. This isn’t incompatible with being smart but smart people find it difficult to just be, to just sit there and enjoy sitting there. They’re more likely to be distracted by thought and to be swept away by those thoughts. They’re more likely to feel like they should be doing something.

So what's the answer? If you’re one of those gifted kids that turned into an overachieving adult, the one piece of advice I’d give you is to let go. Easier said than done - but letting go is something that you have to practice to master. You need to identify those things that get your brain agitated (particularly anxieties) and map them, understand them and understand your attachment to them. Overthinking is driven by a faulty assumption that's been fed into the model of the world that exists inside your head. Seeing what you’re attached to - like a career or reputation, allows you to let go and ease your suffering. 

And of course, practice stopping. Practice being still and watching your mind. You’ll be surprised how quiet it gets when you focus your awareness on it.

272,Lockdown took away everything that got me (22m) over it. I have brainfog and am drinking more again.,"Hi everyone!
After a fruitful year where I got my life back together, got good grades, exercised, stretched, was social, enjoyed my hobbies and had virtually no brain fog, I'm back to square 1 again (at least its not as bad as it was at its worst). 

What got me over it was a lot of social interaction, gym 2-3 times a week, forcing myself into unfamiliar situations and also going to uni class everytime no excuses. I loved the feeling of coming in and a group of people being happy to see me. I love meeting people in.general. 

My country has been in lockdown since September or something and I feel terrible since January. I have had no social interaction, on campus class or anything. Gyms have also been closed since October and I can exercise somewhat outside but not really. 
My discipline is fading and the hopelessness is rising. 

One of my big problems is I never lose feelings for someone once I have them. I swiped 3 months without succes on tinder before meeting her.  I catched feelings for her after a wonderful night.. But afterwards exams and such happened and from her side the connection never recovered. Friendzoned now.

Normally this would not be a problem. I would just do all those other activities I mentioned and being busy would make me not brood upon it each day. I would just go to a party and flirt or dance or drink or have some fun. 

Now I have nothing to distract me from all the temporary bad stuff and it becomes permanent bad stuff. Swiping makes me even more sad. What do I do? 
Knowing my country it will be until next September till things get a tad bit normal again.",1614938651.0
273,I think the most important thing about beating depression is about being deliberate with your actions.,"I think being deliberate is the most powerful thing in life ever. It means you are in complete control even when your mind is not. Let's say you vow to wake up at 8AM everyday but one day you wake up feeling all depressed and annoyed and aren't able to get up at 8. While you shouldn't beat yourself if you weren't able to get up at 8, I think the true sign of improvement is when you can get up at 8 even when you aren't at your best. Being in control, when your mind is telling you not to is the most powerful thing and I think a sign that you are eventually going to beat depression. 

All the people I've interacted with in life have great ideas. Everyone knows what they need to do to succeed. But no one actually does anything. I think that's because most people rely on motivation for doing things. Motivation imo is the worst thing to rely on as a depressed person. I know that I haven't been motivated for more than 2 days for the past 6 years. It just doesn't work for us. We need to be stronger than the rest of the world. We need to be deliberate. Have a valid reason formulated. A fact, not a feeling. You shouldn't feel you need to study for the test. You shouldn't feel like pursing an MBA. You need to want to do these things and you need to know why. Because once you have that that ""why"", you know deep down that you have thought about it before. You predicted that you will have down days and that you need to push through them if you want to find happiness/success. 

Obviously, it's not easy. It's not what I wanted to hear when I was severely depressed 1 year ago. I wanted to know a hack to get better. There's no hack. There's no shortcut. You need to train your mind to think a certain way. You need to be aware that you are still going to fail. And then you need to force yourself to push harder when you are failing. To put it simply, if you are depressed there are only 3-4 things you can do:

* Ask someone for help. Friends/family or even better, therapists. They will help you get your mind ready for this fight a lot better than you can alone.
* Your tough days aren't going to magically disappear. You need to be able to fight/bounceback from your bad days. Once you do this enough, you can control yourself on your bad days and they'll reduce a lot and if you change your thought process enough (maybe after 4-5 years), you will not have bad days at all.
* Find the root cause of your sorrow. Don't bottle your emotions up. I did it with my crush when she rejected me. Don't be like me. Feel fucking sad for 1 week. Don't act like you are cool as fuck and don't actually feel bad that your crush doesn't like you back. 
* Implement changes to your life. If your constantly doing different things in your life (routine is good, but you gotta spice things up once in a while) I think you'll do the above 3 things a lot better. It basically gives you the balls to show that your life can change and that you can be the reason for the change.",1598177578.0
274,Trying not to die before I can actually stop struggling financially.,"I feel like I am burnt out to the point of no recovery. 

I've been working hard at a company for several years, do operations. I've become a weird bottleneck because I understand our data structure/reporting where there's been so much turnover my knowledge of the company is uncommon at this point. Been clocking 50-60 hour work weeks for the last year or two overcompensating. This creates an uncomfortable situation where work piles up if I'm gone, or if anything goes wrong while I'm gone I feel like I'm blamed for the issue. Told management I needed backup a year ago. They instead built up other teams in my department.   
In the mean time I've been wearing down more and more, and now I feel like I'm under-performing/making mistakes because I'm so burnt out. I'm mostly in the same position as I have been. I kind of feel like this has been exploited knowingly by people in the company, I've seen it before, and the worst part is the folks this happens with consistently end up getting the boot after they've been used up. I don't think it's a pathological issue with everyone in management, it seems to more be a side effect of being a start up (transitioning to a proper corporate environment). 

Grew up in a poor abusive/neglectful family, left after high school and didn't look back, worked through college, took out loans, that whole thing. I need to stay employed all the time otherwise I will literally be homeless since I'm living paycheck to paycheck (been this way for more than a decade). Turns out my great aunt was somewhat rich and also hated most of my family. She died a few years back and didn't have any kids of her own so she left her money to multiple people including me. The issue is, it's been almost 2 years waiting for her lawyers/estate to disperse all of that. So for the same time I've been burning myself out  in this position, I've had this carrot dangled at me which would be relief for my debt. I'm not going to be a millionaire or anything, but I'm not going to need to worry about all of this for a while after I get this check. 

I'm so tired, I legitimately don't know how long I can do this anymore. I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack if this doesn't cause suicide. I don't even have a dog or pet which I can just hug to get me through this. Knowing my luck I will literally die days before I can have some relief. 

I guess the broader point of this is, take care of yourselves kids. Don't build up psychological traps for yourself, by overworking for people who probably don't honestly care if you're dead, or by waiting for something to happen. Try to find someone to love, who reciprocates that love. 

/discuss burnout, negative workplace culture, how shitty estate laws are, anything related to this so we can learn from each other's mistakes.

275,Getting Over A Love Interest And Realising I Deserve Better,"Was into this guy for a while, had the nerve to add him on social media and he started messaging me. He was somewhere hot and cold but things were going well. We arranged to meet up (2m distance and that of course) but he stood me up and didnt message me until hours later. I was annoyed but didnt think much of it. 

A few weeks later we arrange to meet again. He stood me up again. We had a long chat, he couldn't come and see me as his mental health was a mess, which is fine, but I told him ""I'm falling hard for you so if you wont let me love you at least they and love yourself"" to which I got no response. It's been about 4 days and I've had no response since. 

So now I have to get over it - if someone doesn't even have enough decency to turn you down, they ain't worth it. He tried using all these excuses like ""you can do better"", but I never wanted 'better'- I wanted him. What I'm saying is if you're in a bad place and someone loves you don't throw that away because your depression has convinced you that you are not worthy of love. You are worthy of love, but you need to find it in yourself.

277,EVERYTHING is a mental hurdle . But i am not depressed anymore and have more and more clear days. What do i do? My mind seems to need to maintain ANY status quo,"Hello everyone!

This one is a bit hard to get into words but everything, from showering and brushing teeth, from cooking to reading (could be anything, also books..) etc 

Anything that brings a change to me makes my head say “no, stop!”. I procrastinate it, i almost instinctively fear those things. Brushing my teeth introduces a cold, foreign substance and texture to my mouth. Showering introduces a sudden temperature change, i dont want that! (Even though the water is warm and a second later i’m enjoying a good shower). 
Reading makes my mind think (its relaxing?), i avoid anything that raises my heart rate. Gaming brings these flashy images and sounds, I don’t want that! I don’t want to leave my bed, not because I don’t want to get up, not because I hate life but because of the sudden temperature change. When I stand I sometimes don’t want to sit down because of I don’t even know why. When I sit I don’t want to stand 

But when I begin gaming, cooking, reading, exercising etc I gladly do them and don’t feel like stopping. I handle them normally. It’s like my mind just wants to really really have and maintain a status quo. 

Apart from that i sport, go to class, am generally becoming a happy person again, but this is something unconscious and I don’t know how to stop it.

My suicidal ideations are just about gone and I don't struggle to get up every morning.

287,3 key things that finally turned it around for me,"Hi guys, 

Been seeing a lot of posts requesting advice about challenges with anxiety, depression, and the rest of the package that comes with it (self doubt, low self esteem, negative self talk, etc…). I thought I’d just point out the top 3 key things that turned my anxiety and depression around. 

A quick background, I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for as far as I remember. Over the years it took so many forms and translated into different physical and emotional symptoms (stomach aches, negative relation with food, and general exhaustion). I had emotional swinging modes of sadness, anger, and hopelessness. During my study years, I had difficulty focusing and usually got interrupted by day dreaming (was told to have ADHD and dyslexia!).

Few years ago, I was in a work trip abroad and my depression had reached the top it ever got in my life. I started contemplating ending my life, and even though I didn’t attempt or consider actually doing it. I was shocked because i never thought the idea could even cross my mind, and so this was the alarm that got me dead serious about figuring my shit out. 

So I thought I would give you a quick summary of the top 3 things that were key in turning everything in my life around (that includes my body, my relations, and my work). i just want to say that there is never one thing that has the absolute answer, but the combination of these steps made the huge difference I’ve always been looking for (of course there’s more into it than these 3 steps, but these were the best start)

   1) Where does it all start

During my depression and anxiety time I found it very difficult to make decisions. I spend a long time trying to get a lot of information, thinking, ad over analyzing things. Even the smallest types of decisions (like ordering a food at a restaurant, or a piece of clothes) would take me long to  finally decide. I used to ponder a lot and think about whether this decision is the right one or is it yet another mistake. I’d also worry about what others think of my decisions, and so I’d ask most of the people around me about what they think. I was also worried about failing because what would that would make me. 

There’s nothing wrong with asking for opinions, and getting some background information. However, excessively doing that drained me of two essential things; energy and self confidence. i realized that I weigh people’s opinions against mine and gradually that left me dependent on others. Suddenly, I realized that most of the things I’ve done in my life were directly or indirectly the result of social and environmental pressures. My clothes, my education, my profession, and the nature of my relations are nothing but clear representations that my decisions were not entirely mine. 

So I started reading and studying more about how we make decisions, and what are some of the decisions that I could make to completely change my life. I suddenly realized that everyday I make millions of tiny decisions that could completely change my life if I become more conscious about how I make them. The decision to eat healthy rather than junk, the decision to exercise instead of watching TV, the decision to work on a side project rather than surfing the internet, the decision to wake up early rather than hitting the snooze button. All these might be small decisions but they shape my life and they make me the person I am. My life is shaped by the decisions I make everyday. So, I chose to save my emotional, mental, and physical energy by deciding once and for all to win the game and build the kind of life I want to live. Most people spend their entire lives without making that decision, and they continue to exist in the no-man-land (swinging and hanging in between). 

   2) Some people live and die without figuring this out 

It’s funny how sometimes the most important moments in our lives are so little that it could be so easy to miss when we’re not paying attention. We were having a sports leader training for a volunteer event when one of the coaches asked us to do an exercise in pairs. The name of the exercise was “who are you?!”. I was back to back with one of my mates when we started asking each other the “who are you question?” each time we were supposed to give a new answer. 

Most of the people in the room answered the question referring to things like their jobs, relationships, sexes, religions, hobbies, sports activities, nationalities, political ideologies, or even pets. It suddenly hit me that all these things were actually circumstances, and none of them reflected who we truly were. I thought what if I loose my memory tomorrow? would that mean I’m no longer who I am, then who do I become? 

This is one of the reasons that drag people into pain when they loose any of these circumstances. I realized that our identities is hugely attached to what we have, and what we do, but not as much to who we truly are. I came to know that who I am has nothing to do with my job, my relations, or my appearance, but it has everything to do with my beliefs, values, and emotions. 

At the end of the day we all want what we want because we want to feel something out of it. Customer psychology revealed that people don’t buy products, but they buy identities. We buy a certain brand show to feel a certain way. This is not only peculiar to buying, but to most of the decisions we make in our lives. We get married (normally), have kids, have friends to feel loved, cared for, and appreciated. The basis that we use to make our decisions are beliefs, values, and emotions. 

   3) Always looking, don’t know for what!

It used to annoy me when I walk into a store and a salesperson ask me, so “what are you looking for today?”. It’s a simple example, but it’s a critical one and it used to happen to me a lot. Most of the time I had no idea what I was looking for and what I really wanted in life. When i was at school, and somebody ask me this silly question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” and because i was too embarrassed to say “I don’t know!”, I’d say something like like the rest of my mates “I wanna be a doctor “, truth is I didn’t! 

Most of my life I didn’t know what I wanted to be, have, do, feel, be with. I just didn’t know! So when i made the decision to change my lief, I figured that the first thing i needed to find out was what I wanted to be, have, do, and feel in all ares of my life. 

So one day I sat down and I wrote everything I wanted in life. starting from my body, my relations, my work, my mission in life, my emotions, finance, travel and fun. I decided to design my life the way people design their homes. I consciously pick emotions, thoughts, experiences, people, and things I want to have. 

It’s a true pleasure for me to wake up in the morning knowing that I have the power over how I want to feel, think, and do in my life no matter what happens. 

These strategies didn’t develop overnight and they don’t come in default mode, but now because this is how I live day to day, they become my second nature. I don’t fight over to do the work because this is who I am NOW. I just flow out of my nature. 

Hope this helps anybody who wants to make a true change and own their lives. Feel free to ask any questions.

288,Robin Williams Recent Passing...,"Okay, is anyone else ruminating on or affected by his recent passing?  Maybe it's a combination of relationship issues and physical and chemical changes in my body, but I found myself pretty affected by his passing.  I saw my facebook feed filled with homages, quotes, etc. from many people that mourn his passing as an entertainer/comedian, but I couldn't help but think of all the other people out there with mental health issues and how they took it so much harder.  

For me it was like losing that uncle you thought was just the coolest and who you felt actually got you...  I'm trying to stay focused on his positive contributions and on my own steps to maintaining my own health, but it's tough to lose another one in the fight.  

Anyway, someone reached out to me just knowing I would be affected but not knowing anything else that was going on with me... so I thought it might be a good idea to reach out to everyone here and see how others are feeling.  ",1407853819.0
289,"My new strategy for getting over it: ""soul makeover""","This is kind of strange for me, but I think I've found a ""getting better"" strategy I can work with, that I don't immediately reject as stupid or ""too hard"".

I'm going to pretend like I have professionals coordinating my life.  So, whenever I'm thinking of what I should eat, I think ""what would a nutritionist tell me to eat?""  And if I'm going to work, I think ""what would a career mentor tell me to do?""

And I'm going to pretend like what's happening is basically out of my control...I am being guided by benevolent spirits.  And I'm just gonna see how that leads me.

Because I've tried changing via ""guilt"".  It's my usual strategy, and it only lasts until I stop feeling guilty.  That's obviously not helping.  So, I'm gonna go exercise, meditate, and read until I fall asleep, because that's what the soul makeover crew wants.",1388123671.0
290,A revelation about my depression. Just gotta get it down in writing.,"I've been struggling with depression for about 4 years now - in that time I've dropped out of university on a ""leave of absence due to special circumstances"", taken a year off to travel and ""find myself"", and returned to school only to nearly fail out again. Now I'm in second year, and I'm once again starting to fall into the same patterns of missing classes. I've still been looking for a way to properly fight this.

I've seen six therapists since this all started, and would like to believe that  I've made some progress in battling my depression, but just yesterday I realized the huge mistake I've been making.

I've been treating my depression as a solvable problem - like there's some miracle solution or mindset that will fix everything and return me to normal. Because of that, I keep psyching myself up for drastic life changes, only to find that I'm just not ready for a massive life upheaval. I go right back into the habits without anyone knowing I've tried. That's not the way to do this.

What I've realized now is that I have to look at my depression as just another personality trait: I'm a good student who tends to get depressed. That's not something to cure, but rather something to accommodate into my life. Rather than convince myself to make it to all my classes and pretend nothing's wrong, I need to set up support systems with my profs, make them aware of my condition, get friends to take notes for me, and on the whole just accept that this is what happens to me. I think I'm done denying my condition - while I'm not going to say I'll ""embrace"" my depression, I'm certainly going to start acknowledging it now. By accepting it into my life as the truth, I think my whole situation may start to become a little bit more manageable.

I'm done coming up with excuses for missing class and avoiding social obligations. I'm not going to be afraid to use my depression as a crutch - ""sorry I couldn't go, I'm having one of those depressed days"" is NOT just some lame excuse, it's a legitimate medical (?) concern that explains what's happening. I think I just realized how serious depression can actually be, and that no one takes it lightly or laughs it off when I use it to explain that something's wrong. When people know you're depressed, they begin to reach out and help. I need to take advantage of that.

I may never cure my depression, but who's to say that anyone can? I'm changing my goal now: I want to make a life with depression more liveable.

291,Grieving alive parents,I realized that my parents are just in another world . They dont understand me and I don’t understand them. Im an adult now but I feel sad to not spend alot of time with them cause I just don’t have things to discussed with them .. 😞 anyone can relate ?,1646619590.0
292,I can't stop loving her,"My ex (29F) and I (30M) broke up at the beginning of this year after 10 years together. It has been almost 10 months apart and I just can't seem to get over it. I've been trying everything I can possibly think of to get life after her back to normal for myself. No contact, spending much more time with friends and family, focusing on my business, exercising and I've taken up 2 hobbies to keep myself busy (hiking and mountain bike riding). However, she still crosses my mind several times a day and it's driving me crazy. My anxiety is peaking and my mind has gone to some terribly dark places of late.

She in the meantime has managed to move on and started dating a guy I suspect had meddled in our relationship towards its end. Last night we had a Halloween party with mutual friends and it was my first time seeing them together which has sent me spiraling.

Unfortunately, I'm a very nostalgic person which leads me to dwell. It hurt so much to see them together, so I clearly wasn't ready yet to see that. She was my first love and my best friend and the only person I had ever let in so close to me. Not even my parents know me as well as she does.

I just feel that after 10 months I should really be getting over it by now. I know you can't really put a timer on these things, but hell, it has almost been a year and the wounds feel as fresh as the day we broke-up.

What sage advice can anyone offer that I could try to get over this? I'm so tired of feeling so sad, frustrated and angry. I need the love I have for her to be dead and buried so that I can move on.

TL;DR I (30M) just can't seem to get over ex (29F) after being broken up for 10 months and she has met someone else. Affecting me in a serious way in terms of anxiety and depression. Just want to get over it now.",1635707467.0
293,Has anyone taken a break from their careers to heal? What advice do you have?,"I am thinking of taking a lower paying job out of my field to recover from burn out from graduate school, 2 stressful/toxic  jobs, and the pandemic. I feel like I can give no more after pushing it since 2018. Now I can’t even remember my own life and learning and enjoying life is difficult. 

I feel like a shell of who I used to be so I would like to reduce my stress while I heal. I plan on using the next 8 months to save and pay off bills so I can take a lower paying job for a year and reassess after regular therapy. I hope I can enter back into my field after some intensive therapy and developing new skills to manage stress. I also need to reassess why I wind up in these toxic workplaces and how to do better.

&#x200B;

If the stars aligned, I wouldn't mind talking to her, but I don't feel that level of sorrow and depression that things didn't work out with her. Time and focus really helps.

295,"I never do any hobbies that make me happy, even though I desperately want to.","I work at Walmart 40 hrs/week. I don’t think I have to say it, but I work all the time. I’m only 19 and I feel like the best years of life are being wasted. If I rest, I feel like I’m wasting my free time that I could’ve spent on my hobbies. If I work on my hobbies, I feel I’m wasting time I could’ve spent resting. It’s a constant cycle that didnt start until I started working all the time. If I don’t sit on the couch thinking about wanting to play games or drawing, I’ll open up my computer, sit there for a few minutes, and turn it off. Or open a game, take 5 steps, and close it.

296,What do normal people do with their lives?,"So this is kind of a stupid question but I'm genuinely wondering, what do normal people do to pass the time everyday? When I'm not working, in school or spending time with my boyfriend I usually waste away hours laying in bed scrolling on the internet or watching something or even just zoning off and I hate it. I have hobbies I enjoy like playing ukulele but a lot of times I can't find the energy to get out of bed and do shit...or my brain will convince me that if I do those things I enjoy I'll get tired of them and won't want to do them anymore. Has anyone else felt like that?

I feel like all I do all day is scroll on my phone and smoke weed (I'm workin on it). I am trying to structure daily routines for myself to be more productive. I exercise almost everyday which has been a major improvement in my life, but besides that I feel like I do nothing. Obviously life has changed a lot with the pandemic but I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. The worst part is it seems so easy to just do *anything else*, something productive, but I feel like if I spend more time doing productive stuff I'll run out of things to do and sink into depression. I know this is a stupid way to think but I can't break this mindset. Surely everybody can't be living like this? I am doing a lot better now than I have in the past and will be starting nursing school soon which will occupy much of my time. But I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my free time besides just waste it mindlessly browsing the internet. This routine brings me a strange sense of comfort and kind of cushions me from feeling depressed...its like when I get up and get off my phone everything just hits me and feels heavy? Not sure if this made sense but thanks everyone for reading.",1609619052.0
297,What if depression is a mental habit?,"What if we repeat a thought we don't like until it becomes a habit? And then this unpleasant feeling that is associated with that thought becomes a habit as well, like a subconscious mental that seemingly arises out of nowhere while the truth is that it arises because we repeated thinking about it so much that we became sort of addicted?  Like smoking; no one is addicted if the smoke one cigarette. Not even two or three.

It's like ""yeah I guess another cigarette can't hurt"", or ""I'm so cool when I'm smoking"" then after a couple of months you don't think about it.. you just buy them and light them up.. then a couple years later you can be labeled as a ""smoker"" it's part of who you are. It's something that you do subconsciously, automatically, out of habit.

Could it be the same with our thoughts and feelings?

Depression usually doesn't just come out of nowhere one day, full force, right? It's something that grew over time and became heavier and harder to get rid of, like smoking.

298,When the person that hurt you dies...,"When I was 6 my mother’s newest husband began to molest me, by the time I was 8 years old he was raping me almost daily. I told my mother at one point and she slapped my face and said I was trying to ruin her marriage. I asked his daughter if he was doing it to her too and she beat the hell out of me. He was the local town cop and I was just a “problem child’s divorce & an alcoholic abusive father” so I was a liar...
When I was 12 I recorded him saying things to me during one of his late night visits to my bedroom....I got him to say things he was doing and played the tape for my mother and she kept the tape and we finally moved out...

299,"I need to start moving somewhere in my life, but I feel utterly apathetic.","This Saturday I turned 25. Considering it marks a quarter of a century, it made me really ponder what I'm doing with my life.

For the past six years, I've been in some sort of psychiatric treatment, with different diagnoses and different 'solutions' to the problems. I've been diagnosed with lots of diagnoses ranging from adjustment disorder to psychosis. In the beginning, I used to feel like I was underdiagnosed, but nowadays, I feel like I'm overdiagnosed. I think the most accurate diagnosis was mixed anxiety-depressive disorder, I don't think it's worse than that, but I don't think it's more benign either.

Anyway, enough about diagnoses, they're quite arbitrary anyway. My real problem is that I can't get anything done, and that I'm way behind my peers when it comes to accomplishments in life and achieving my expectations. I'm still a freshman at the uni, I changed four uni courses, and I still haven't achieved anything.

I had quite high expectations and hopes from life, and yet, I haven't achieved almost any of them. My social life isn't non-existent, but it isn't that good either. I never had a romantic partner in 25 years of my life. As a matter of fact, I never had sexual intercourse either, because I'm either too scared to talk to the members of the opposite sex or I don't like them. I do have some friends, but I have a feeling they're a bit... Reserved? Either way, I don't think they're most comfortable having me in their company, and I think the feeling's mutual. It's like I can't be truly myself with anyone I know.

I'm incredibly lazy. In the past six years, I haven't achieved almost anything. I haven't been successful in my academic life at all, and it's the same story with other aspects of my life as well. Self-discipline is not my strong suit and has never been. I still don't know how to cook, how to wash or iron clothes, how to properly clean an apartment... Okay, the latter one isn't that hard, but I'm just too lazy to do it.

The worst thing is that I still have fairly high hopes and dreams. I know I should be ditching them in favour of settling for a life of an average Eastern European, considering how lazy and unmotivated I am, but I just can't. I still crazily believe one day I'll stop being lazy, apathetic, dysthymic, and that I'll start achieving and moving somewhere with my life, but as I'm getting older, I also have a feeling it's just my pipe-dream and that I'll just fail more, get more frustrated and irritated in my life.

I've been on various meds, and I feel like none of them are doing anything for me. Granted, I'm not as aggressive and as short-tempered as I used to be, but is that even a good thing? Currently I'm taking five different meds: an anti-depressant (venlafaxine), an anti-psychotic (aripiprazole), two different meds that are supposed to help with my hand tremor (propranolol and clonazepam), as well as zinc magnesium calcium mixture that's also supposed to help me with my hand tremor some way. Truth to be told, I'd rather be taking none, and be able to go out with my friends and get drunk. I haven't been drunk in almost four years, and it's agonising. I'm no alcoholic, far from that actually, but I have all the normal needs people in their 20's do.

The more and more the time passes, I have less hope and will to change things. I just feel utterly apathetic and dysthymic, I just want to take my own life. I know it seems like I'm overdramatizing things, but if I can't achieve my goals, live up to my hopes, or even find pleasure in things people my age do like going out, having drinks and one-night stands, what's the point of this life? To be alive? What's that good for? Life's an utter piece of rubbish anyway, so if I can't at least enjoy some things in it, what's the point of living?

Any ideas on what I could do? I don't even trust my therapist, as a matter of fact, I am very much sick of even seeing her. All she's gonna do is nod her head, say, yeah, the things are complicated, and say I should continue taking the meds. That's counter-helpful to me. I have been seriously thinking about saying to her that I don't want to see her any more as she isn't any help to me, and somehow get off the meds. At least before the meds I felt like myself, nowadays, I'm just so apathetic.

Anyway, sorry for a long and somewhat incoherent post, I hope it's still somewhat understandable. If anyone has any ideas what to do concerning my therapists, meds and other things, any help would be appreciated.

P.S. I would've posted this in /r/depression, but I'm not too fond of that community.",1592388241.0

301,After Years of Struggling with Depression and Anxiety I've Decided to Try and Make a Difference,"I'm spending the next month fundraising for an amazing Australian charity that helps with mental health, beyondblue. 

A little bit about me:

A couple years ago I was starting to notice a change in myself. I was lethargic, bored all the time and got annoyed at every little thing. I started just not caring about anything. It wasn't until one time driving home thinking I couldn't really care if a car hit me and I didn't make it out alive. I realized at that moment that I wasn't my normal self. I still didn't get help but took time of work and seemed to get better or so I thought with nothing popping up. Then my mum died suddenly while I was home and I went off the deep end. Everything crumbled around me and I didn't even know the worst would come a year down the track. I had a blow up at my boss and that was it, I broke down and went to the doctor who finally prescribed me medication. It took time but I felt much better, I still go through bad patches and sometimes really bad patches but as a whole I've picked up my life from where I was at.

&#x200B;

Alright a little about my charity efforts:

I got an amazing response from my friends and family when I decided to post it on Facebook and I smashed my original goal of $500. I've still got a month to run on my fundraising so I'm really hoping to hit $1500 by the end with the amazing help of family and friends.

My fundraising consists of 2 fundraising events:

\- 24 hour stream on 14/2/2020 from 10am Western Australia Time

\- Fundraising Day at my sport club on 16/2/2020

&#x200B;

How can you help?

\- Checking out beyondblue and the work they do.

\- checking out the 24 hour stream (don't mind you leaving once it's done, it's more about joining in on something that can help on the day)

\- Know of any  company that might help out with raffle donations? Please let me know as I would love to be able to do some giveaways 

\- If you are in Western Australia and would like to come to the charity day just contact me. I would love to meet you and have you come down for the day.

\- Just reading this post I hope it helps with anyone that is currently struggling.

302,Part 2-Tips to Deal with Depression: A Novice's Guide to Self Help,"If you haven't read Part 1 of my post here is a link with 9 tips to help you cope and also goes over my background for context:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/getting\_over\_it/comments/dwx56q/tips\_to\_deal\_with\_depression\_a\_novices\_guide\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/dwx56q/tips_to_deal_with_depression_a_novices_guide_to/) 

As a disclaimer, I'm in no way an expert or a professional. I'm just girl that has suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for 10-15 years give or take. I know everyone is different and some of these things may not apply to you or may not be practical for your lifestyle but I tried to include some diverse tips that hopefully can help some people cope with their depression/anxiety. As always, I hope everyone on here gets the help they deserve and I hope that you fight hard for yourself because you deserve it whether you believe you do or not. ♥

&#x200B;

1. **Prioritize Emotional Distribution:** What I mean by this is determine what you are willing to spend your emotional ""coins"" on each day. For me I not only had a hard time controlling my remorse and sadness, but I also had a hard time controlling my temper when it came to mundane, trivial things. I do the 9-5 grind in corporate America and every morning I have to deal with rush hour traffic. Certain mornings I would huff and puff and get myself all flustered over waiting an extra 5-10 minutes on the freeway, whereas now I take a breath, put on a peppy song and try to distract myself. I know that's a silly example but it applies to really anything that you may come across on a daily basis. I had to determine what really mattered to me and sitting in traffic for an extra 5-10 minutes ultimately doesn't ruin my day and doesn't warrant an emotional response. I noticed if I let one thing like traffic annoy me, my day would ""snowball"" and ordinary things would bother me more than they should and by the end of the day I was exhausted, in a bad mood and just wanted to shut down. This definitely takes conscious practice.
2. **Social Media Breaks:** Social media can be amazing as well all know, but we all also know it can be a bit poisonous depending on what we expose ourselves to. I find days where I'm glued to my phone and mindlessly scrolling through Instagram or Facebook and it can be utterly mind-numbing after awhile. Especially on visual sites like Instagram or YouTube it's too easy to get caught up in other people's appearances or skills that you may be envious of. Instead of mindlessly scrolling on your phone, try turning it off for a just a few hours to do something a little more productive. (I especially like to do that when I'm with friends, family or with my boyfriend) What I like to do is cook, watch a movie, read a few chapters in a book, take a walk/drive etc. It allows me to clear my head a bit and actually enjoy the present moment instead of having an excuse to mentally ""check out"". 
3. **Solo Travel:** I know this may not be a viable option for everyone whether it's location, age restriction, financial strain or time constraints but if you are able to find a way to even just take an overnight trip somewhere I highly recommend it. Obviously be as safe as you can about it but thankfully in this day and age we have things like constant communication with loved ones and access to a lot of information about a place before we travel. I am a female in my mid 20's so safety has always been important to me so when I took a solo trip for the first time to Denver CO, I made sure to get a reputable Airbnb, tell someone where I was going and ask the local bartender if I was safe walking around town at night. Thankfully Denver is a pretty safe city so I was able to walk downtown without any trouble but I understand if other people aren't comfortable with doing something like that. With all that aside, solo travel has always been incredibly liberating to me. I'm able to create my own itinerary without anyone else protesting, visit the places I want and abide by my own schedule. And in the process, I was able to actually enjoy being by myself and enjoy my own company. 
4. **Donate/Volunteer:** I know either may not be practical for your lifestyle but this is a simple way to give your everyday life more satisfaction and make you feel good in the process. For me I don't exactly have the time to volunteer on a regular basis, so monthly I donate to my local Humane Society. If I didn't have the funds to donate every month, volunteering is an amazing way to get yourself out of your shell, meet new people and help out your local community. 
5. **Ask for help:** If any of you are like me, it's nearly impossible to reach out and ask for help when you need it. You don't know where to start and it can be scary opening up and being vulnerable which I completely sympathize with. We're in the day and age when mental health is (hopefully) taken more seriously and more widely understood. There are more resources out there than ever before to help us if we're not able to help ourselves. Take advantage of the resources in your area and instead of me listing off the dozens of resources, Google ""free/affordable mental health resources"" in your vicinity. There might even be something you can do from your phone/laptop. 
6. **Comparison:** I touched on this briefly in my first post under **Perspective** and I want to dive a little deeper because it's a common thing that I think a majority of people subconsciously do. I'm sure we've all heard the phrase, ""Comparison is the thief of joy"" by now and boy, can I attest to that.. As a female I have the tenancy to compare myself to other females around me. Thinking, '*God*, *I wish I had that body' 'I wish I was as pretty' 'I would kill for that hair'* Or any other number of toxic thoughts. I noticed nothing came good from it, I was always too intimated to compliment her and never took a moment to appreciate my own qualities. I subconsciously still compare myself physically to other women, but now I have to consciously check myself and try to switch my line of thinking. Instead of feeling envious, I try to go out of my way to audibly compliment her which makes both of us smile. I try to admire her beauty and not use it as mental self harm. On another token-it's easy to compare your accomplishments to others and downplay or discount your own. As I touched on before I have an entry level job in a corporate environment with Executives and VP's and I often find myself feeling ashamed about where I am compared to them. I have to take a step back and realize that most of these people are 5-15 years older than me and we all had a different road we had to take. We all have had different opportunities leading up to where we are now and as long as you're actively working on your goals, they will pay off if you're patient. Whether that's your career, art, music, writing, cooking, gardening, school etc. For me I mostly work on building my career and what helps me keep perspective is comparing my current accomplishments to my career and accomplishments from a year ago, 2 years ago, 3 years ago and so on. It validates that I'm making progress even if I feel like I'm failing. 
7. **Practice Letting Go:** Not only does this apply to what has happened to you, but to what you've done to yourself. For myself I held onto such negative sentiments for specific people even though I hadn't been in contact with them for years. What they did to me made a big emotional impact even though they didn't necessarily know and it didn't effect them. As I went through in my first post, journaling really helped me let go of that animosity that I had for a specific person or situation that had a negative impact to my life. I would write a letter to that person that hurt me, write down every negative feeling I had toward them but I never sent it. Even though they never saw it, it allowed me to release those feelings in a tangible way. I realized holding onto that pain really only hurt me further, it prevented me from loving myself and moving on. I think a part of me held onto that pain and used it as a part of my identity and I used it as an excuse to be depressed, or not trust people, or hurt myself etc. 

On another note for **Letting go:** I used to hold onto so much regret and remorse for mistakes I had made (no matter how big or small) and it would keep me up at night and send me spiraling. Circling back to #1 I had to prioritize what actually mattered to me and what wasn't so important. I had to actively convince myself that the mistakes I had made were learning opportunities to not make that same mistake in the future. As much as we like to tell ourselves we can learn from other people's mistakes (in some cases we definitely can), sometimes we have to make them ourselves to truly understand and apply those teachings to future situations. It can hurt so much in the moment but I'm sure overall it made us stronger even if you don't feel that way. For example, for years I struggled with communication with my partners. If I was unhappy in a relationship I would shut down and refuse to open up because I didn't even know how to articulate how I was feeling or make it better. My partner would always notice and ask me what's wrong, then I would just continue to deny and abruptly end the relationship shortly after. For a long time it would bring me regret for treating them that way and treating myself that way. I'm still actively working on my communication skills but I find that I'm leaps and bounds better with expressing concern or dissatisfaction with not only my current boyfriend, but with my friends and family. I had to learn how to give myself a little slack and realize I'm human and I'm more capable of making mistakes than not.

To keep this post manageable I'll cut it off there. Please share in the comments any tips that help you cope with your depression and anxiety! I would love an open discussion. And of course as I said in the beginning, everyone is different and some of these things may not apply to you or be practical for your lifestyle. The point is to either remind you of what you have to do to keep yourself in check, or give you some fresh ideas. Stay strong everyone! ♥",1574199130.0
303,"I have a different view on suicide, and I think I'm crazy because its different.","(Posting in other subreddits) I am 23, M, and have suffered severe depression for a very long time. I have seen over 10 therapists, multiple IOP programs, and tried many different medications. And now whenever I suffer from issues with life and school or work, I think about suicide. 

I think about how It can be justified. How not everyone was meant to live a good or happy life, for example me. How those that are fit to suffer through life will continue to live, while those that can't deal with it will end up dead. It's because of this... that I don't want to stop someone from suicide. If someone close to me were to commit suicide, i would sympathize with them. It would be sad, but also i wouldn't be upset about their decision. I've spent a lot of my struggling trying to look for sympathy and validation of my issues, but people tend to get upset by that. So here I am sympathizing with those that did what I have not.

Am I crazy? Am I a monster? I think there is so much wrong with me, but I can't change any of it. Its just how I came to view this horrifying world. And I don't know what to do now...",1573062330.0
304,"Depression getting worse as I age. More visible symptoms, declining physical health, less to aspire to. Don't know what to do.","This is long. More of a ramble. I'm just trying to make sense of where I'm at. I don't know if there's any advice to be got from this, but feel free. Particularly if someone has a real ""got over it"" story after lifelong depression. That'd be good to read.  


I've had a low-level depression my whole life, but I think I've gotten by because I always had something I was striving toward. Getting good grades, making varsity, getting out of my dysfunctional dad's house, maintaining my college scholarships, etc.  


And back then my symptoms were mostly numbness, anhedonia, and sudden outbursts of anger. I didn't sleep, but I was busy anyway. I had suicidal thoughts and self-harmed, but I kept it all to myself.  


I had a major episode in my early 20s where I shut myself into my apartment, played video games, and ate nothing but convenience store food for 3 months. Thankfully I had savings from my ridiculously stressful first grown-up job. I got over that and really started addressing my depression. Read a lot of books on CBT, mindfulness, etc, dabbled in therapy (not hugely helpful tbh. I'm independent and functional, what more can you do?).  


But life happens. Throughout my 20s I was diagnosed with 2 incurable illnesses, had several failed attempts at relationships, and floundered in my career. I was... aimless basically. What do you do once you've hit all the milestones? I had no desire for husbands or babies or white picket fences... so after school... what's left? Meanwhile my energy levels were slowly being drained away by my illnesses. No pain, thankfully, just *tired* all the time.  


Needless to say I hit another major episode right around 30. This time was worse. I lived in a dump. I'd switched out pastries for alcohol, which really didn't help my stomach issues so I barely ate at all. I didn't play video games so much as lay on my shitty crack mattress all day thinking about killing myself. This went on for 6 months. Then I ran out of money (my entire savings account from 8 years of working...), so I got my ass back to work.  


But I don't feel... better. I feel like this is going to haunt me my entire life. I started taking meds after my second episode. They've helped... ish? Maybe? I have to switch them around a lot because they stop doing anything after a while.   
Saw a couple therapists again with the same results- nothing's really wrong. I know myself and am realistic about most things. I don't have depressive thinking. I'm ""a sensitive person"" but otherwise I'm fine. My last therapist initiated our ""break up"" because he just didn't feel like there was anything to talk about and maybe I was under-medicated""?""  


I'm still drinking too much, still not eating. My stomach hurts, both from the illnesses and the drinking, to want to eat. I've lost 20lbs, so it's been noticeable to others. I'm starting to feel a little... bipolar? Like I'm either quiet and sober and very sad or I'm drunk and/or doing something reckless and laughing maniacally because ""nothing fucking matters."" I did not used to be like this. I used to be a fairly steady, focused person. A lot of my friends have started ""checking in"" on me. I  know what they're doing. I'm not mad or irritated or anything, it just makes me realize how obvious the symptoms are becoming.

And I'm so *tired*. All the time. I don't know if that's my illness or my depression. Maybe both. I'm still aimless, and now on top of that I know my real-world limits. My ego really took a beating in my late 20s. And since I've lost all that weight, I don't even have the endurance or the strength I used to. Exercise is just *hard* now. I used to like it.

I don't know what to do anymore. Everyday life feels like it's getting harder and harder to bear.",1570031002.0
305,I was attacked by my alumni group and I can't stop thinking about it,"To give you an idea of how long this has been a problem, it started late *last year.* 

There was some stupid Facebook drama between me and some asshole who turned out to be in charge of diversity something. She made a big post to the biggest alumni Facebook group (5000+ people) ""exposing"" me and encouraging other alumni to attack me. I had multiple panic attacks while she harassed me, and the admins of the group did nothing. I even sent screenshots of what happened to some staff of the college, and as far as I can tell, nothing was done. On top of all this, the vultures at the school paper decided it would be a good idea to report on fucking *Facebook drama.* Of course, it celebrated my bully as a poor innocent lamb just trying to ""raise awareness.""

Since then, I can't stop thinking about what transpired over those days. I have dreams about it, I still cry from it, and my heart sinks when I see any news about an alumni-related event because I'm scared someone will recognize and see me as the terrible person my bully made me out to be. I don't want to participate in anything with anyone from college. I am afraid to talk to professors and acquaintances I knew. I dread the moment when people google my name and see that pathetic article as one of the first results. Hell, when people even ask me, ""How was college?"" I want to puke. 

I think these are probably irrational fears, but *please* reassure me that they are irrational. No one else in my life knows I feel this way, and I want to get over it so that I can move on with my life and not dwell on this horrible event anymore.",1555546101.0
306,Finished my intensive group therapy this week and I feel so accomplished.,"Almost a month ago, I mentioned I was in the worst mental state I’ve been in a long time and I decided to start going to an outpatient hospital program. It was intensive, DBT group therapy everyday, from 9am all the way to 4pm.

It was incredibly exhausting and my first day I felt like a made a mistake. I realized how much I needed to accept and tackle, I started opening up how past trauma for the first time and facing it head on. I would get home everyday and go straight to sleep because I was so tired from doing it...but I did! I learned a lot of tools that will help me in the long run and to not be so hard on myself. I’m in a period right now where I’m learning to be selfish and love myself, which I’ve never done before.

I’m still pretty depressed and low but I’m entering another program that’s not so intensive for 6 weeks. It’s a scary feeling when you start fighting against your depression, you’re reminded that there’s more to life and it’s possible for yourself. I’m really excited for the future and what the rest of the year brings. 

I hope all of you know that you are incredibly strong people, we struggle with our mental health but you still get up everyday to fight it and that alone is huge. Hoping that everyone gets to where they want to one day, it’s a battle but you can do this!",1551537416.0

309,I can't shake this betrayal and grief.,"About 6 months ago my mom died. While she was dying in the hospital I found out that my girlfriend at the time was cheating on me. I tried venting back when it was all going down. I've been in therapy. I'm currently doing this EDMR stuff. I've done 14 sessions of that. I'm not feeling any better about what happen and I still think about it all the time. I can see my mom throwing up blood. I remember my girlfriend not answering her phone because she was at that other guy's house. Now it's Christmas time. Today would have been my mom's birthday. Now I'm dealing with with that. She gets to hang out with her mom and family and spend time with the guy's family she cheated on me with. I'm spending this time of year working alone and volunteering at the soup kitchen downtown. 

&#x200B;

It just pisses me off how I have no family left alive anymore. I thought I was going to start a new family with her and that she was going to stand by my side like I would stand by her's. But instead she ran away into another guy's arms as soon as my mom was hospitalized. She now gets to continue experience the love of a family and a lover while I spend this time of year alone. 

&#x200B;

I guess really I need to spend a few years off from dating. Get over my mom's death and learn to live without a family at all before trying to date anyone. I know it doesn't matter who she is with or what she got after all that was said and done. I'm supposed to just worry about me but it still pisses me off. I can't stop thinking about it.

She would have been 2 on December 26th. She was the missing part of my heart that I didnt know was missing until she was there, and then cruelly ripped away. 
The rational part of my brain knows that it was the humane thing to let her go, but I am struggling with grief and guilt that I stole time from her, and I am a monster for putting her down instead of pursuing thousands and thousands of dollars in cancer treatments for only a scrap of time more, compared to the long full life she deserved and should have had. I cant stop thinking about her. I just want to wrap myself up in her blankets and die to be with her again.  I dont know how to deal with these feelings. I cant talk to my husband because he grieves differently , and is handling it better than I am. I also dont feel like talking to a therapist would benefit either because ""she was just a dog"" , but she was so, so much more to me than that, and I dont have the funds for it.

313,The guide I owe reddit. What I did to overcome and grow from my depression [long text],"It’s me your friend. Your silent watcher, that knows you want to try, you might not know how though.


First off, let me tell you I’m not a doctor. I’m just someone who was raised in a certain way that led to some bad decision with even worse results. There is so much I need to tell you, but I really really need to do in a way that won’t confuse you….too much.


When my ‘depression’ started I swore myself to get better, come back and to tell you guys how I did it. And after 1+ year I’m finally there.


One thing I found very annoying while trying to get better were people claiming they were ‘depressed’ but never actually explaining to me what exactly made them feel that way. So even though I’m deeply ashamed for what I’m about going to tell you, it’s a really small sacrifice if I can help just one person.


Also the work I will propose here, might differ at some points from popular opinions because I hardly read any books on depression. It will be a combination from exercises, questioning society and questioning our own thought patterns.

 
Also keep in mind that I’m only human and that most stuff I will talk about will be heavily filtered through my personal experience and way of life. I’m not trying to fool anyone by pretending to be objective cause I’m not. Just try to find some middle ground between my world and yours.


So if you are interested in an easy to read, positive and (hopefully) well explained tutorial on how to improve your life read on.

&nbsp;

**How it happened**


&nbsp;



Before I can begin I need to tell you my story because after all that is all I know. But don’t be discouraged if your situation seems completely different because I’ve found that the methods I use to be universal applicable most of the time. Like it or not but most depressed people share a common pattern.  So let’s start all over:


Before everything began I was a person who was very good at shutting any kind of bad emotion away. I was convinced that I was doing the right thing because that’s how my parents told me to. Looking back there were many times where I felt alone, wanted to cry or scream but not only have I ignored these needs, I constantly told myself that everything is good and I have no right to complain. I was 100% convinced I’m a happy person because I was cheerful 24/7. 


Now I understand that I was living in a fake bubble which eventually had to burst. And I’m glad it did even though it was the most painful experience in my life.


But first things first. So I was living this fake happy life for 22 years until I started dating a toxic girl. She did many bad things but **the worst was to make fun of me in bed**. When I wasn’t able to get hard instantly she said ‘wow, other men don’t have that issue’, when I came to early she said ‘do it better next time’ and when we were talking about a serious relationship and I expressed concern regarding her faithfulness she said ‘as long as you satisfy me, you don’t have to worry about it’.


I was deeply hurt by these words, ashamed that in her eyes I’m worse than other men and put under enormous pressure by the constant comparisons. But of course as with any feeling that was overwhelming to me I avoided it, telling myself that everything is fine.


My method was put to a real test there. I did it for one month, ignoring all feelings of sadness, anger and shame and started feeling bad. Then I waited a month more. And another, another….until 7 months passed and I was essentially dead inside. 


Life became living Hell.


Depression, PTSD, Anxiety, Sleep disorder, mood disorder, foggy mind, no concentration, muscles twitching, panick attacks etc., I didn’t know what was happening to me at the time.


Everytime I was meeting that girl it was like going to the most important test of your life. I hoped that things would get better over time, since I followed the ‘expose yourself to stressful situations method until you get used it’ but they didn’t. If anything it got worse, I was stressed 24/7 for months until I lost clear sight in me right eye.


Once I finally managed to break up with her, I started to realize how serious the situation was. Instead of getting better, I started to understand the damage I have done to myself. 


I started going to all kinds of doctors but they had only the same solution: anti-depressants. I decided not to take them and seek a solution I would be happy with. And I found it. If I would have to sum it up it would say my solution was:

&nbsp;


**20% Meditation + 20% Therapy + 20% Books + 20% MDMA + 20%Self exploration**

&nbsp;


I’m here to explain the reason of each one of these and how they helped. If you stick around you might be amazed.

&nbsp;

**Meditation**

&nbsp;

I’m sure everyone knows that, so I won’t waste your time here. I’m just going to add a few things people might not know and why I’m doing it.


Meditation is free, easy to do and doesn’t take much time. It is very subtle at what it does so you won’t see the effects directly but over time you will realize some things are changing for the better. You process information in a different way, you will gain some small cool abilities like being able to see your thoughts clearer and help your brain heal.


But the most important part about Meditation for me is very different. It allows you to process/let out moments or emotions that you might have avoided during a busy day (or a bad period of your life). Let’s say during a birthday party your father says something hurtful to you but things are going so fast that you forget to do anything about it. I guarantee you that you might have forgotten about it but your brain didn’t. Once you take your time in the evening, sit down and start meditating these moments will immediately pop back up into your head and demand you spend some time with it. I will later go into detail why I believe that is very good and healthy to spend some time with hurtful moments. 


For now let’s think about emotions like water in a **closed boiler** that starts boiling once strong emotions hit you. The steam won’t be able to escape the boiler unless you take your time, sit down and let these emotions flow through you. Meditation is like a vent that allows your body to process these emotions in a healthy and good way, like steam that found an opening. This is the very reason why some people feel **more emotions** the moment they start meditating instead of being ‘calmer’ as they expect. The thing is meditation is going to make you calmer in the long run. Your body will get used to the fact that every day you will take your time to vent all issues and will run more smoothly. 


Another critical ability you’ll learn through meditation is the ability to **listen to your body**. Where do you feel anger? In the chest, stomach or even the head? Where do you feel sadness or anxiety? Exactly how do they feel? It’s possible you’ll feel all kinds of feelings while you meditate and that’s when you’ll start to develop a new relationship with them. Instead of running and avoiding, you’ll stay and give them the attention they need. I know that it will be hard and completely new but it’s necessary in order to get better and in case you’ll get overwhelmed you can stop it any moment you want. But remember: **the more feelings come out, the better for you even if it doesn't intially feel like it**


Thanks to different books I’ll talk about later, you’ll learn exactly how to find and deal with feelings  but I see mediation as the sole foundation of that.


That’s why I believe meditation to be a necessary tool that should be used by everyone that has any issues at all. (Actually everyone could benefit from it) I recommend at least 20 mins a day. (10 min in the morning – 10 min in the evening)


And remember: There is no such thing as ‘bad’ meditation. There are dozens of guides out there, but the main objective is to stay in the present moment for as long as possible. But if thoughts pop up don’t fight them. Spend some time with them (they need attention) and then return to the present. There is no such thing as ‘people that can’t meditate’. If you really believe you are one of these people just sit down for 10min with your eyes closed. This alone is going to work wonders in the long run. You **will** see a difference over time all it takes is some patience and little time of your day. I promise you that.

&nbsp;


**Therapy & Books**

&nbsp;

I’m neither going to tell you that therapy will magically fix you nor that it’s a waste of money. It’s something in between and just like in school the outcome depends just as much on the teacher as the student. 


So in other words, yes finding a therapist that really gets you is important but so is being ready to work hard to see improvements. I’ve seen countless people going to the best therapists and seeing no change because they just didn’t take it seriously. 


Also, one fundamental thing I was shocked to see was that **most therapists either don’t know or forgot how it is to be depressed/anxious etc. and as a result don’t stress the obvious points enough.** It was so frustrating for me when my therapist told me things I really understood on a logical level but just didn’t know how to really apply it into my emotional life because he didn’t bother to explain them.


For example when I told my therapist that just thinking about sex makes me anxious, he answered with a plain ‘you need to accept it’. I was like ‘…ok I’ll try’ but thought ‘pff whatever helps, just make it go away’ in the back of my head. I was doing the opposite without even knowing it.

The breakthrough came when I **added a few good books**. In the end it was the unique combination of what I learned in therapy and what knowledge I gathered from the books that resulted in major leaps of progress that stunned even my therapist. Note that I believe that reading too many books/internet stories can and will become counterproductive. It’s important to gather knowledge but when you become obsessed with it, are doing yourself no favors. **You need to know when to stop. This goes also for the time you spend on any depression related sub/forum like reddit. I can’t stress that enough.** 



The books I’ve read are the following:

&nbsp;


1)	Panic away (great for anxiety)


2)	David Burns – Feel Good (great for depressing/sad thoughts)


3)	Sane new world (Mediation, how to listen to your body, how to accept them)


4)	Maps – MDMA Therapy (to get things started)

A Manual for MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy

&nbsp;


So yes, I believe good therapy with motivation from your side to change things can really do wonders, but you need to be ready to dig deep, also in your free time, so you have new things to talk about the next time you meet your therapist.


Once you got out of the very worst, therapy is like a guide that checks back to see if everything is going alright. It’s a good feeling to have.


Now for those of you who don’t want or can’t go into therapy I’ll try to give you the most basic idea what I believe a skilled therapist should do. Note that I don’t want to go too much into detail here, because I believe these things to be different for everybody, so I really really think you should try it out for yourself before following blindly my advice. Also I recommend CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) since it helped me the most. 


After talking with your therapist about your personal story and motives you should start doing two things:

&nbsp;


1)	Find **real** peace with your past 


2)	Find these stressful situations and expose yourself to them in **safe, controlled setting.**(I will talk about this in the ‘MDMA’ part)

&nbsp;


Both things probably mean much more than you think right now.


Finding **real, authentic peace** with your past will most likely mean that you’ll need to change some of your life goals, because many of them are a result of compensation that has been caused by previous bad experiences.


See that guy that is addicted to working out? Most likely he was skinny/fat in his past and bullied because of it.


See that girl that is obsessed with shopping? Most likely kids made fun of her cheap clothes in school.


See that guy that spends his entire time coding on computers? Most likely he is addicted to be in control of something because he had no control over his life at some point.


In the end, finding real peace **can and will change you as a person. You need to be willing to accept it.** And if reading this you think now ‘but I don’t want to change’ you have found one of major step that keeps you from progressing. I will talk about it some more in the ‘self exploration’ part. 


Exposing yourself to **stressful situations in a safe, controlled setting** is a bit more tricky since it means two things:

&nbsp;


1)	Talking about the very worst moments of your life with someone you trust (for most this means a therapist but it doesn’t have to be. It has to be someone who can see you in your worst, most pathetic form and still give you support and the feeling of being accepted. I believe unconditional love to be the correct term here)

&nbsp;

This goes hand in hand with the previous **finding peace part** but focuses on the worst moments. Only this time it’s not so much about understanding how much these events have influenced you and changing your life goals. Instead the aim of this exercise is to find feelings from the past that have never been let out and giving them the attention they needed. Just because you forgot about these situations and feelings it doesn’t mean that your body did. **You need to go back to these hurtful memories and scream, cry and grief like you should have back when they happened. Even if it takes weeks or months to process it entirely, that’s what it takes. You will be amazed how much pressure it will take off your chest.** If you don’t know how, don’t worry most people are completely lost here. At my very beginnings I used Elliot Hulse’s exercise:

I know it looks completely crazy, but I swear that it helps you to unlock these feelings. If it’s still too hard don’t worry, I’ll talk about it some more in the ‘MDMA’ section.

&nbsp;


2)	Exposing yourself to these situations (if you can) in real life in a **controlled setting.**

&nbsp;


I understand that this is not always possible but most traumatic events have some sort of influence on you in the present day. Take me as example. Sex became traumatic for me, where I’d worry about everything. ‘Will I get hard?’, ‘Will I keep my boner?’ ‘Will I finish in time?’. Knowing this my therapist did the only right thing. He didn’t teach me some magic trick about how I can ignore my feelings of fear & terror and have sex how I used to. Instead he slowly started showing me that sex isn’t as important as I believed it to be (as it turned out, I literally felt like sex is the only way I will ever experience love and that life without it is worthless) and how I can **stop caring** whether I get a boner, lose it or finish in time or not. 

He made it very clear to me that no matter what happens I will be OK. Everything will be just fine. (while I literally felt like the world is going to end)

So as soon as I found a new GF I told her straight up that I’m deeply traumatized and don’t know whether I’ll ever be able to have sex with her. (Note that just saying that already took a lot of previous work to accept my ‘new’ issues as part of me and instead of being ashamed and hiding them I was very honest in a ‘look this is me, and if you don’t like it, I’m sorry but we won’t work together’ way.) As any good person would she was completely OK with it and was more than ready to help me. 

In the beginning the exercise itself revolved around us both getting completely naked and her stroking my whole body (except my dick) with her hand how I wanted her to for 20 min. No sex, No arousal. Just for fun. After that it was my turn to stroke her for 20min the same way. Arousal of any kind was forbidden. 

It took some time (1-2 months) but as soon as I got comfortable with somebody touching me again, it was time to stroke the whole body including the genitals. The next step required us to only stroke each others genitals and when arousal occurred it was allowed to stay for a few minutes at a time. All in all it’s been 6 Months and I’m now on step 4 from 6 steps in total. 

**No matter what happened during the exercise it was strictly forbidden to have sex shortly before or after. My brain had to learn that touch & arousal are not always automatically linked to sex. It formed new habits. Habits lead to confidence. And confidence is the opposite of anxiety.**

So what can we learn from it? That forcing yourself into stressful situations isn’t always the right answer. Sometimes it’s the right thing to do to step back and start doing **baby steps in a setting where you are in control.** A person I’ve met had a very different situation with the same exact core mechanic. She was terribly scared of driving in the subway. As a result she avoided it as much as she could and only **forced** herself into it when there was no other way, making things even worse. 

So I advised her to do it just like me and start with baby steps. Instead of only taking the subway for big distances when she really has to, I told her to take is every day for any distance she wants without any goal she has to get to. Just for fun. So she started doing that and made it just to the next stop the first time. After a few tries she was able to make 2 stops. And after a few months she was already perfectly fine with driving the subway for 30min without any bigger issues. 


At the same time, when you are doing baby-steps, odds are you will encounter feelings of anxiety and fear eventually. But this time it’s in a controlled setting and thanks to the book ‘panic away’ you’ll also know how to deal with it. **It’s a perfect combination where you define your pace and intensity of the workout. I’ve actually grown to enjoy it because I see how much it helps me.**

&nbsp;


**Traumas & MDMA**

&nbsp;

As I said before this step is mainly for people who have troubles getting with their inner feelings in touch. If this is the case more often than not, some type of trauma is responsible for it. Without going too much into detail here, I’d divide traumas into 2 basic categories: 

&nbsp;


1)	**Single traumatic event**, is something that took place just once but shook the person to his/her core in such a way that they weren’t able to process it in a healthy way. (rape, beatings, accidents etc.)


2)	**Complex trauma**. Compared to single events complex traumas are usually whole periods of time (highschool, college or even childhood) were feelings of neglect, fear or sadness were part of your daily life. Instead of one big thing there were many small things that hurt you in some way, you didn’t process properly. 

&nbsp;

Speaking in the most general terms, the mechanic I’ve found to be the most accurate in describing what happens to a person who suffers from a trauma that isn’t processed in a healthy way is that first and foremost that **person loses contact to his/her inner self.** Either all at once (single traumatic event) or step by step (complex tauma). If one imagines the flow of feelings as a river I see small traumas like rocks that start to clog it and a big trauma like a massive landslide that instantly shuts any movement down. People experiencing a whole traumatic period get colder and colder as more detached from themselves they become. 

&nbsp;

**Their feelings get numb in a way.**

&nbsp;


The irony here is that modern society, movies and media glorify numb people as something cool, strong and worth pursing. What they don’t mention is that being numb is the worst of all feelings and people affected by it will do anything to escape it. Sex, drugs, insane working hours or crazy expensive therapists. I will talk more about this in the ‘self exploration’ part.


Another factor that goes hand in hand with this is that once a person is affected by some trauma he/she isn’t able to embrace good/positive feelings like love, warmth or passion the way he/she should. When confronted with these feelings these people either reject them because they don’t trust the person that is giving it to them (believing that the person loves them now, but will hurt them later) or reject them because they feel like the love they are getting is bound to some condition (believing that the person loving them, will run away as soon as he/she finds out some horrible truth about them)


What follows is **detachment from your inner self and starvation of love and warmth that everyone needs.** I don’t care what you say. **Everyone craves that feeling of being loved and accepted for who he really is.** Most people compensate for it by looking for these things in other places. Sex (mostly with random people) being the most common one. Food is another one. Meaningless relationships another one. Etc. Thing is as time passes these people eventually realize that they were wrong and that there was nothing of value to gain there to begin with. That’s when anger, sadness and frustration kick in. Basically depression as we know it. 


**Being numb doesn’t mean you won’t feel anything. You will be at war with yourself and the world, sad, angry and frustrated most of the time without being able to enjoy the good moments. And to make it even worse there is little to nothing you can do about it.**


&nbsp;


**Once you lost your inner peace you will do anything to get it back. Life is hell without it.**


&nbsp;

Regardless whether you’ve been victim of a terrible event or just a ‘cool’ adult that was too weak to deal with emotions and preferred to run from them or a mix of both, there is a way out. 
I totally understand that when I say listen to your inner feelings some of you might really not know where to begin. Sometimes a trauma (of both kinds) can be so severe that some (or all) memories of a certain event (or period of time) will get foggy or even completely repressed. 


The thing is the victim does not know that. You believe that things are exactly as you remember them but if you’d spent some time with it you might realize that there were many details, feelings and moments you completely ‘forgot’. Now, why should you care? Because keeping a memory repressed puts a lot of pressure on your brain and body which can result in many symptoms such as sleep disorders, increased heartbeat, inability to deal with stressful situations, anxiety etc. And to make things worse how are you supposed to start healing yourself when your most hurtful memories are not accessible for you? 



I believe you understand why finding these moments and talking about them is a **complete gamechanger.** It allows your body to finally deal with them (just like steam finally leaving the boiler) and start a healing process that goes far beyond the trauma itself. Once the healing is set in motion it will help other areas of your life that (at first) seemed completely unaffected by the trauma. Revealing repressed memories takes that immense pressure of your chest that some of you might feel and opens you up to many unexpected possibilities.


So how do you do that? How do you remember something that has been long forgotten? Well without going to much into detail, you basically make sure you get **pure MDMA** (not that shit on you get on the street), and take it either with a willing therapist or a really good friend you can tell anything in a comfortable setting. You will be either sitting or laying down most of the time talking about whatever comes into your mind, listening to music or just relaxing. In case you didn’t read the MAPS protocol I gave you the link to I will sum it up:

Don’t eat for at least 3 hours before taking it. After taking around 80-100mg wait for an hour and take half the dose again. The trauma always comes up by itself. As soon as you will feel the urge to talk about certain things you’ll know it’s your body trying begin. Your friend/therapist is just there to give you assistance but you’ll be doing 90% of the talking. It’s important that you discover and understand things by yourself. Your friend should ask you sometimes to repeat the most important breakthroughs to make sure you remember. After you’re done write everything you’ve learned down. I’d suggest to take afterwards two days off work to process and integrate the learned lessons. I’ve had some profound breakthroughs in the days after my MDMA therapies. Don’t waste them. 


In case you exactly remember the event you still approach it the same way. MDMA has more than just the potential to unlock repressed memories. The things you’ll spent time thinking/talking about will appear less terrifying, warmer and  safer. For the first time ever you’ll be able to attach some positive feelings to a bad memory making it appear less harmful and intimidating in the future when you’re sober.


So to make it short: MDMA is not magical. **You are.** It just helps you to unlock your potential and you take it from there.


You do MDMA once a month for three months. After that you’re done and need at least a 3 month break…..if not more. Don’t push it.

&nbsp;

**Self exploration**

&nbsp;

I wanted this part to be the last one on purpose since it’s the most undefined one. It’s more or less the part where all of what you’ve learned (and other things you’ve learned about yourself on the way) come together to form a new you that is more true to yourself (and as result happier) than you’ve ever been. The next paragraphs will be things I’ve learned for myself in more or less random order.


In almost any therapy there is a lot of talk about **‘your inner child’. In fact I believe it to be the most true part of yourself** from a day and age when greed, jealousy, sexuality and other ‘bad’ feelings didn’t cloud your goals and judgment. When you close your eyes and think back to your childhood what were your life goals back then? Who did you look up to? Who did you like and who did you not like and why? Just because you grew up it doesn’t mean these thoughts and wishes vanished. They are still there and there is much to learn from them.


In regards to panic attacks or anxiety I have one general rule (from the great book panic away): **Feelings are never ever your enemies.** There is no feeling or memory that can hurt you. Your body is trying to protect you with them, even if it feels terrifying. So even if these feelings seem sometimes so overwhelming, don’t ever fight them. Allow them to happen, flow through you, your body is trying to help you.


The best analogy my therapist gave me was that you need to **see your feelings as your children**. They need love, they need care and sometimes lots and lots of attention. Now if you feel anxious in a situation it’s just like a child being and **crying for help.** If you start fighting that anxiety with force it’s literally like **hitting that child** for being annoying and loud. It’s so wrong on so many levels. Instead you should hit the pause button for a moment, close your eyes, find the place in your body where the feeling manifested and listen to it. With time you’ll learn how to cheer that sad kid up again. **If you are anxious just be anxious. There is nothing wrong about you, don’t ever feel ashamed that you have feelings others don’t.** How do you think would your child feel if it would realize that you are ashamed because of it’s uncontrollable emotions or body functions (basically for things that are beyond it’s control). **It would literally die on the inside.** That’s what you’ve been doing to your body.


Next I want to talk about this black and white type of thinking most depressed people share. They are convinced that there is **this one and only thing** on this planet that can give them inner peace, happiness and fulfillment. It can be a dead relative/fiancé, a missed opportunity or sex as compensation for lack of love in their past. They would literally trade anything for it. Three years ago I’d have traded everything I possessed for sex with random girls because I was starving from lack of attention and love. Either way, this type of thinking is toxic because it links your personal happiness with just this one single thing and as we all know happiness is infinitely more complex than that. You are actively reducing your whole life to a single thing and to make it worse if the thing you crave for can still somehow be achieved you are literally tormenting yourself on a daily basis. On days you get what you want you will feel high/super happy but on days you won’t you’ll crash like a plane and feel depressed, down and sometimes even sick. I know life is full of ups and downs but not living like this is too extreme for the body. You need to start asking yourself why this one thing is so important to you and accept the reality that you are very likely overestimating the importance of it. (MDMA, Meditation and Therapy are the tools that will help you here). Don’t be a slave of a past that you have never really accepted and your insane goals that lead you down a path that even isn’t the true you. You are so much more than that.


Another aspect I’ve seen and been affected countless times is comparing the past to the present in order to belittle and feel sorry about yourself. The ‘I used to be like this but now I’m only like that’


People are convinced that before the trauma occurred they were flawless human beings, with only good sides to them but now have to deal with an uglier, moodier, sadder version of themselves, wishing it never happened. I’ll tell you right now, there is nothing to be gained from that line of thought. Not only is it an illusion, because you most likely had issues before, that just were hidden but by not accepting certain ‘bad’ events in your life, you are creating a whole lot of frustration and anger. Maybe just maybe the sadder, moodier version of you is for the first time the real you. I’m not saying that to make you feel bad, but just like many people, maybe you were suppressing all bad emotions inside of you for years and since the trauma you are not able to. You have all the reason in the world to feel sad and down for a long time because you have to grief over 1) the trauma itself 2) past events you suppressed 3) and the present that is frustrating to you because of said mechanic. But I promise you one thing, if you stop fighting your emotions and just let them be, you will be healthier and happier in the long run. Would you rather live a fake happy life, or a real life that sometimes means you have to cry? I know what I’d chose. 

To demonstrate this even further I’d suggest you look into the art of **Kintsugi**. It describes a process that something once broken (like something simple as a pot) is not uglier because of it. It can be repaired and by the use of golden glue  the aim is no longer trying to hide the damage but proudly showing it to the world. It is now part of you and you are better because of it. A video explaining the logic behind it:

&nbsp;


I’ve mentioned society a couple of times because it plays a major role in most cases. Depression never occurs in isolation. It’s the result of the interaction between you and the world (and by world in mean other people, you hardly would be depressed if you’d be living alone on an island with some tribe). Almost everyone feels that there is something wrong going on in society but most can’t quite define what it is, let alone fight it. This is a very delicate topic because it touches on subjects like media, politics, religion and basic morals so I’ll try to be as subtle as possible.

**Media**

People know that the world portrayed by big media and hollywood is not real. But there is a big difference in knowing something as a fact and really understanding/accepting it into your life. And worst of all **people lack good alternatives.** Even when 4 in 10 people see through the typical lies big media tell you today 

&nbsp;


1)	Sex is the only meaningful way to experience love 


&nbsp;


Which is just reiterated by the fact that porn actors are being paid to sell emotions while they fuck. Most people watching porn crave the emotional interaction that takes place and soon expect the same kind of passion from fucking strangers.

&nbsp;


2)	That only manly men and beautiful women will find love


&nbsp;


Guys hitting the gym 5+ times a week and girls worrying about any small detail of their bodies because they are scared the won’t find someone suitable for them and the only possible reason for that will be the way they look. The result are completely shallow people that have a lot to show on the outside but very little to offer on the inside.

While yes, looks might help in the beginning stage, they are completely irrelevant when it comes to building a meaningful relationship. Soon these people realize their relationships don’t work and adapt a ‘I will just keep doing what I’m doing. Mr/Mrs perfect will occur at some point eventually’ even more toxic mindset. 

&nbsp;


3)	That the number of people you’ve slept before doesn’t matter 


&nbsp;


This lie has been repeated so often that most people actually might believe it. I don’t have to argue this one, there are plenty of statistics out there that prove this is one big misunderstanding of reality. 

&nbsp;


4)	That being emotionally numb, cold and indifferent is a state worth pursuing 

&nbsp;


Today’s society has done great progress in many areas of life leaving emotions and ways to deal with them behind. Quite the contrary seems to be the case. People learn from big media that suppressing emotions for a momentary gain, revenge and jealousy and worst of all trying to kill/compensate (because you can’t ever actually kill a feeling) overwhelming, unpleasant emotions will somehow turn you not into bitter, frustrated and deeply sad people but into cool untouchable gods. 


It doesn’t matter if you are lifting weights because a girl cheated on you, you went on a diet because a guy told you were fat or use sex to numb your broken heart. All these are compensations, therefore even if productive on the surface (like lifting) are still toxic at the core and done for the wrong reasons. 


There are dozens of examples: Barneys Stinsons or Charley Harper were the idols of many guys without them realizing how toxic these characters are. 


&nbsp;


Let’s say 4 out 10 people will see through these lies and understand that the world doesn’t work like that. They still will have a hard time finding good, attractive alternatives to rely on and most of them will be eventually washed away. It’s easier to join the stream than to constantly fight it for no apparent reason. 


I’m here to tell you that you need to take a giant step back and understand that many of the issues you have are the result of one or more of these lies working into your head. The feeling that at all times you have to be strong and independent. That you have to be manly or beautiful. That you have to have ‘experience’ (in bed) or else someone might laugh at you. You allowed (and I don’t blame you for that) that these lies worked themselves into your life and thoughts. 


I hope sooner or later you will be able to understand that just because you behave different than the norm, have anxiety or depression or don’t look/behave in a certain defined way there is nothing wrong with you. **What is wrong is that you are trying to force yourself to be someone you aren’t.** Twisting your character, hiding your weaknesses and pretending to like stuff you hate. 

This is a self-destructive path that will never make you happy. Whatever you believe, the only true happiness you will ever find in your life will be by closing your eyes and asking yourself 

**‘Who am I really?’**


Without work, sex, social pressure or expectations you (or someone else) have put on yourself. You need to find your own unique place in the universe that might be totally different than what you think right now.


What is a life as a doctor good for if you hate blood? Wouldn’t you be much happier working in an animal shelter, where the **earnings are bad but you are happy and feel loved?**


And if you have social anxiety so be it for now. Nothing wrong with that either. 


I know this might sound crazy but keep in mind that in the very worst case you can pack your stuff and start and life somewhere in the forest or desert. Or join a Temple where people hardly talk. Or just travel by yourself. I’m joking around but it’s supposed to give you perspective that life is so much more than the one thing you are forcing yourself to do. It’s supposed to take some weight of your shoulders by accepting the fact that whatever you are doing is never a matter of life and death. There are plenty of alternatives, one cooler than the last one.



But if you decide to work on your anxiety, hats off for you. Do it at your pace, the way you want it to do. I understand that it might not be for everyone but there is a guy I respect that has turned his life completely around, just remember: **it is ok to fail.** It is ok to feel anxious. I know you are 100% certain that only good things will happen in your life when you ‘beat’ your anxiety. This is not true, you have just developed a tunnel vision and need to understand that some of your thoughts are just baseless:

**Anti-depressants**

&nbsp;


While it might work for some in the short term it’s never a long-term solution. Imagine getting a headache every time you are in a sauna. Now you can take some pills for your headache but for how long will they help you? 1 hr? 2hrs? 


Assuming you are not dead by now your headache will eventually return. There is no pill out there that will fix your headache forever as long as you are in that steamy sauna room. The only solution will be to leave the sauna.


Same goes for your thoughts. As long as you don’t work on them and start believing that you were wrong on certain topics and make major changes in your life (both mentally and physically) anti-depressants will fix you only for a while. 

So to sum up: for the very very worst cases it might be beneficial to take it **short term with therapy** to get out of the very worst. Once you out you need to take matters in your own hands, reduce the pills and start doing what I’ve described in this essay.

314,Finally letting it all out: from childhood to now,"I'm so glad somebody made this subreddit. And every other mental health subreddit. 7Cups, Survivors of Abuse, Suicide Watch. So many more. All those subreddits have been so reassuring. Seeing other redditors able to put their pain into words, and seeing them receive validation and acknowledgement that it's not wrong for them to feel this way. 

The things that have been swirling around in my head have been so painful for so long, and I don't know what to do about it anymore. I hope maybe if I put things down in writing, I can help grasp why I feel so lost, so disconnected.

~

I was raised poor, in an inner city. I remember helping mom pick bits of grit and dirt out of the bags of rice we bought at the grocery store. We ate rice gruel for dinner often, at least three or four times a week.

One of my earliest memories is helping my parents throw out my crib. We found a garbage dumpster and left it in there. I was sad, because it was my first sense of loss ever. My dad told me not to get too upset, because we picked it out from there anyway.

My family lived in a basement apartment, while my mom worked in a factory, and my dad finished his doctoral dissertation. I was a latchkey kid for as far back as I can remember. We were too poor to afford daycare. My earlier memories are of sitting in front of the TV, watching cartoons, while my mom goes to work and my dad goes to class. Mom leaves cold food in the refrigerator for me. I'm alone most of the day, but it's okay because I have the TV. One day the police come to the apartment, looking for someone who lives upstairs. They ask me where my parents are, and I tell them I stay alone. They're still there when dad comes home. The police tell him he can't leave a toddler alone at home. Dad is angry. My parents can't afford daycare. They tell me not to answer the door, or pick up the phone. If somebody comes around, I should pretend I'm not there. I don't want to make more problems for my parents.

I like being alone though. When mom and dad are at home, they're always fighting. They only scream at each other. I've never seen them kiss or even hug. The parents on TV always say things like ""I love you,"" or tell each other nice things. They never yell like my parents do. I learn years later my dad has another woman.

We're poor, even for an inner city family. Other kids make fun of me when they learn I'm from the tenement buildings in the east side of downtown. I start to love hockey, and ask my parents if I can join a league. My dad tells me we're too poor. I collect hockey cards the other kids have thrown into the garbage, either because they're damaged or they're doubles. I want to play soccer, or baseball, or anything my friends are doing, but my parents tell me it's too much money. My dad takes me to a used sports equipment store, and shows me a set of goalie equipment. He shows me the price tag, and says if we only eat instant noodles for six months, we can buy it. I don't say anything, and we leave the store without buying anything. I don't want to be any more of a burden. In the 4th grade, my teacher arranges for the class to go ice skating, because all good Canadians know how to ice skate. My teacher takes me to the school poor bin to get a pair of skates in my size. The poor bin is in the office. There are windows everywhere, and everyone can see me.

Dad finishes his dissertation. He finds work in the suburbs. We move there, into a run-down townhouse on the edge of a new school district. Mom finds work at a factory with all the other immigrants who can't speak English. Mom and dad work, but we are still poor. Dad is spending less time at home than ever. Mom is sad and cries a lot. I don't know what to do. I watch a lot of TV.

I am one of the poorest students in a rich suburban school district. I am in high school by now, but I don't know anybody. All of these kids have been friends since preschool. Dad says I should start playing team sports, but I don't want to hear anything he has to say. He's never home, and mom cries all the time. I start to spend more and more time on the internet. The computer is one of the few things my dad bought for the house.

Dad stops coming home at all, and rents an apartment near his office. He says it's so he has a place to stay when he does overtime, but we know it's so he can be closer to his other family. Mom stops cooking, or doing laundry. When we go to the grocery stores, she buys microwave meals, and asks me ""is this alright?"" She looks sullen all the time, and since moving to the suburbs, she never sees her friends anymore. Nobody comes to visit us. Mom works an early morning shift at the factory, and is gone when I wake up for school in the morning. When I come home, she is usually sleeping or watching DVDs alone in her room. I microwave myself something for dinner, do the laundry, and stay in my room on the internet all night. At least he left the computer.

One night a woman comes to our house and stands on our front lawn, screaming at the house. Mom tells me to go to bed and ignore it. Sometimes she drinks and cries.

I feel so full of emotion but I can't put it anywhere, I don't know what to do with it. I want someone to talk to, someone I can love and hold onto. Everything feels so painful, but I can't talk to anybody about it, and I don't want to bother my mom about it. I feel so alone. One day, while we drive to the grocery store, she tells me she was pregnant again, shortly after I was born. She tells me dad told her we were too poor to raise another child, and told her to have an abortion. I don't know what to say, and we finish the car ride in silence.

One day, I'm visiting my dad, and I find a picture of his child with the other woman on his computer. My half sister. She's playing pee wee soccer. She looks so happy. I hate her. I tell one friend at school, and the next day everybody knows I am from a broken home. I never speak to that person again.

I get a crush on a girl at school, and write her a letter. She never responds, and her friend tells me she doesn't care for me in that way. I am crushed, but push those feelings down inside me. I try so hard not to resent her, but it's so difficult.

I want to go away, so badly. University is an escape for me, not just from this home, but from the suburbs, and these people who look down on me and my family. I don't want to be here anymore. I want to be where the poor people are again. I go to the city for University.

~

I fall in love with a girl at university, D. We start dating. She's from a city, and the daughter of poor immigrants too. She's the most amazing person I've ever met. We stay together every night. I try to stay reserved. We shouldn't see too much of each other, right? But she tells me that she likes being with me, and if I like being with her, there's no reason we shouldn't be together always. Her logic is faultless. We spend time only with each other. For nearly a month, neither of us sleep alone. At times, it seems we have no other friends. My fondest memories are of the days we didn't have class. I would wake up with my face in her hair. All I could smell was her. All I could see was her. All I could feel was the duvet and her skin on mine. Pulling the covers above our heads, we would stay there until the air got stuffy and unbearable. Then we would stay in there longer. The whole world was her and I. We would lie in bed and talk and hold each other for hours.

After six months, I tell her I want to marry her. She gets scared, and tells me we should spend time apart. I cry a great deal. She starts talking with another boy, and then she gets sick. A bad cold. I know she lives alone, so I come over to her home every day for a week to take care of her. I know we're apart now. I don't care. Her apartment is a mess. It looks like she hasn't cleaned in ages. 

On a cold January night, I'm emptying her bedroom trash can as she finishes the soup I made. This fevered, congested, beautiful, perfect woman asks me to hold her hand. I sit on the floor next to her on the bed stroking her hand all night. I don't dare move to get a chair, in case I break this moment. She tells me she wants to go back to the way it was. The next morning she pulls me into bed. I tell her I don't have a condom. She says she doesn't want one. I kiss her so fiercely, hoping I can force ourselves into one being. If I try hard enough, I think we can become one. We move in together, but I never mention marriage again. I'm so scared of losing her again. But just over a year later, she sits me down, and says she wants an open relationship. I crumble.

I push to keep our relationship closed, and I smother her with attention and affection. We stay together for another half year, before she tells me she's found someone else, and is going to sleep with him, whether I like it or not. I move out. I stop going to classes and nearly flunk out of school. 

I call my mother to come pick me up. Driving home, we stop the car on the side of the road and both start crying when we realize she and I are the same person. Someone who needs to be constantly in love to the point of bursting. 

I try desperately to find someone else to fill this gap, and resolve that I will be alone the rest of my life. I see D again on the bus a year later, and I immediately get off the bus. I find a bathroom and cry uncontrollably for the next hour.

Years later, I meet B. She is the most wonderful person in the world to me, and hopelessly broken too. She sits alone in the corner of a party, staring at her feet. We talk forever. We read all the same books, listen to all the same music, love the same philosophers, think in the same way. Her parents are immigrants too. She was raised poor, never having anything either. She wants to be a teacher. I fall completely, utterly in love. We stay up talking all night. She has anxiety attacks all the time. I write her notes telling her I believe in her. Things she can take out of her purse, and read when she needs reassurance. She tells me they help her more than any medication. Selfishly, I hope it makes her as dependent on me as I am on her. 


We chase self destruction together, getting drunk and declaring we will die together. She wraps her slender fingers around my neck, and crushes my throat hard when we kiss. So hard it leaves marks. I love it. It marks me as hers. It is the most intoxicating thing on earth. I tell her if she wants to kill me, she can kill me. If it would make her happy, I would die. She kisses me as if I am the most important person in the world to her. She wears bracelets to cover up scars on her wrists. I think her scars are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. They mark her as someone like me, someone damaged.

She grows distant. She never introduces me to her friends. I learn this is because she is seeing someone else. I am her other man. I crumble, and resolve to cut off all contact with her. Months later, she tells me she needs a couch to sleep on for a night over the holidays. I can't say no to her. I could never say no to her. She comes into my bed that night, and I am happier than I have been in years.

The next morning she is distant, and does not want to talk. She explains this was a one-off. She goes back to her boyfriend. I can't handle this anymore. I sever all contact with her. I can't handle this anymore. I can't bear to look at her. I can't bear to hear from her. I can't bear to know she exists.

I'm older now. I haven't dated anybody since B. I've been on dates, but I don't want anyone ordinary. I want someone damaged, like I am. I want someone broken too.

I meet a girl, and she's kind and patient, and I ghost her. Her family is too stable, her outlook too normal, her life too charmed. If you are with me, it's only pain and struggle. I don't think she could handle it. I get drunk and tell her to stop seeing me.

~


My parents are still not divorced, but don't bother talking anymore. Some time ago, Mom started spending time with a bible study group from her factory. It's helped her refocus her life, which I'm very grateful for. She refuses to remarry or even date. She says she was burned by dad already. If she gets burned again at this age, she'll lose everything she has.

My dad says my half sibling wants to build a relationship with me. I want her to simply not exist. Mom says dad once told her ""the child is innocent in all this,"" when referring to his daughter. My mom got infuriated and asked what I had done then, to deserve this. 

D and B both have found new relationships. I haven't. I moved to a new city two years ago for work. It's even worse than the suburbs. It's hard to make friends. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I chase self-destruction recklessly now. If there's a drug, I've probably taken it to the point of unconsciousness. I feel so numb, and I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I go to work, I do well at my job, and then I come home and self medicate until I black out. I don't have any real friends in this small town. They're very interested in me listening to their relationship problems, but when I start to offer up anything like ""I find it difficult to connect, because I had a difficult childhood,"" they invariably answer with ""Everyone's had it rough, buck up."" I find it so frustrating so many people don't understand that sometimes people simply want you to listen and sympathize. 

I understand my life was relatively good growing up, but... it hurts. It hurts to think that my dad loves his other kid so much more. It hurts to know that I raised myself throughout so much of my life. It hurts to know that I grew up so poor that now I have an obsession with money that my friends and colleagues don't have. It hurts that I have to pretend to be normal and act like everything's alright when it's not, it's so clearly not. 

When my dad tells me about all the good things his daughter is doing, I have to bite my tongue and not cause a scene, when all I want to do is say ""I'm really glad you and your new family are doing really well. I'm nearly 30 and still have a pathological fear of infidelity, and have no interests other than TV and video games, because I was a latchkey kid from the moment I could walk. Also, I have an intense insecurity about growing up poor to the point where I can't interact normally with people who didn't grow up eating dollar store spam. But no, I'm really glad your new family seems to be doing so well.""

When my depressive episodes come on, they hit me like a freight train. I derive my value from being in a relationship with someone. My own sense of self value is so tied to everything that happened in childhood, my head feels completely fucked up sometimes. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't know what it is to do your grocery shopping at a food bank. 

I've always tried to carry myself with a sense of dignity, but it's increasingly hard not to identify as someone who grew up in a tenement block, with friends on welfare. Especially when work colleagues or friends talk about playing hockey, boats their families own, second and third homes their families own on the east coast they'll inherit. I grew up as trash in the gutter, and in my mind I'm still there. If not, why would my dad leave like that? If I mattered, wouldn't he have stayed?

I want so badly to matter to someone. It feels so good to finally be able to write that down. It's something I've never been able to acknowledge before. Therapists and analysts have never been particularly good at doing anything for me, except asking if I have coverage, and trying to get me medicated. 

To cope, I've tried to replace my pathological desire for romantic love, with filial love. I talk to my mom a lot more now, despite the language barrier. We try to talk about our feelings, and I try to live my life the way she would want me to, but it's difficult, and something that's still alien to me. I've spent most of the past weekend in my bedroom on my laptop with the lights turned out.

If anyone has bothered to read all this, thank you. It's been so painful and stressful holding all this in. I carry so much of this every day, and every night I struggle to fall asleep, my mind racing with thoughts of what could've or should have been.

316,Fighting Depression With Cleaning,"I've wanted to share this with others for a while, and this seemed like a good place for it.

I know when I get depressed, it's a struggle to get through the ""gottas"" of the day. Gotta go to work. Gotta feed the kids. Gotta go to school. Doing these things while depressed often leaves me too drained for anything else, like cleaning. And it can get really bad. No clean clothes left. No clean dishes. Trash piled around my desk and bed. Kitchen floor more dirt than linoleum. Of course, this would add to the depression and feelings of failing as a parent and a person.

But having a clean house can give me a much needed sense of accomplishment, and I feel better when in a clean space.

I wanted to share the system I came up with for myself, hoping that someone else will find it useful. I break it down step by step, because I find that helpful. If you don't, think about it however you want: such as on a room-by-room basis. It's not meant to be ""Oh, you need instructions on how to clean a kitchen"", but rather chopping it into manageable, simple tasks.

Don't let yourself get dragged out of the steps either. If a room is already a mess, it's ok to make it messier until you come to it. One of the biggest roadblocks to dealing with a large cleaning job is moving around trying to put everything away at once. This can lead to circle of ""Well I can't get the mail off the kitchen counter until the desk is clean. And I can't clean up the stuff on the desk until the closet's clean. And I can't clean the closet until...."" If you have some stuff that you don't want getting temporarily lost in the shuffle, grab a grocery bag and hang it on a door. Vital items (keys, important papers you may need in the next couple of days) can be thrown in there. Going in circles can leave you spending hours cleaning with no noticeable change in the state of your home. Once a room is clean, you can put things away immediately as you do other rooms.


First of all, take your time. This isn't about rushing to a clean house. I usually do this over the course of a weekend. Use whatever means work for you to give yourself only a periods of cleaning you can handle. You can throw on the TV and use commercial breaks. You can set timers for X time cleaning, Y time resting. You can google up a drinking game for your favorite movie or tv show, and change the drinks to minutes of cleaning. Use breaks in a video game. Or do one task at a time and take a break. Whatever works for you. These steps will just go through as if you weren't taking breaks, and just insert your breaks wherever.

====================================================================
Step 1: Laundry [The laundry sections make the assumption that you don't need a laundromat or anything that requires you to be sitting in the same room as the washer/dryer for the duration. If it does, skip this step. If you can proceed with laundry, I find having multiple laundry baskets to hold clean clothes in very helpful, even when I'm not dealing with depression.]
====================================================================
Grab a laundry basket. Pick 1 load to do. Don't pick anything that needs a lot of stain treatment or pre-treatment. I like to pick something necessary, like school or work clothes. Go around and gather up only clothes that fit that 1 load. Doing a load of darks, and there's a white shirt next to your bed? Don't feel bad about just leaving it there. The goal here is just to get 1 load of laundry.
Throw that load in washer and get it running. Now, even if you need a break, you're cleaning. Something is getting done. I like to start with this both for that reason, and because laundry takes a set amount of time with no way to speed it up, so going through every load can take all weekend depending on how much you have.
As you go through the other steps, continue moving laundry through the washer and dryer. When you take clean clothes out, don't worry about folding or putting them away just yet. The main thing is that they're clean. If you have multiple clean baskets, just toss them in there. Otherwise, find a place where if you don't get to them for a couple of days, it's ok and pile them there. (i.e. don't pile them on your bed, your couch or anywhere else where you plan to be to relax.)

====================================================================
Step 2: Kitchen
====================================================================
The kitchen is one of my favorite rooms to clean. The difference is very drastic, giving you something to look at and feel good about. It also lets you cook for yourself (clean pots, pans and dishes) instead of doing fast food that makes you feel more lethargic. And it often goes faster than your think it will.
First, empty the sink. Just grab whatever dishes are in there and move them to the counter. This gives you room to rinse. Rinse the dishes as much as needed, and load the dishwasher. If you have more than one load, think about what you will need over the course of the day and next morning (coffee mugs, plates, a pot or two, silverware). Once the dishwasher is going (and remember, as with laundry, this means you're cleaning even if you need to go sit and watch tv or surf the net or whatever!) fill the sink with any remaining dishes, fill with water and dish soap. This will make doing any next loads easier.
Just gathering up all of the dishes into one place can be a huge help, and make a big difference in the visible mess. Next, work your way around (pick a direction, clockwise or counter clockwise, and start at one end of the counters and move to the other) and gather up trash and toss it. Then, do another circuit, this time putting away any food items that have been left out. (Dry foods such as cereal, peanut butter etc. If refrigerated or frozen foods have been left out, toss them with the trash).
Finally, do a last circuit with a sponge/cleaning wipe and wipe down the counters. After all the dishes are done, come back and wipe the sink. Don't worry about floors. Those are a different step. Now you have a clean room. Any remaining ""mess"" is soaking dishes. Come back and unload/reload the dishwasher between other steps.

====================================================================
Step 3: ""Your"" Area [Tasks listed for desk/office]
====================================================================
This will vary based on where you want to be between cleaning segments. Maybe it's your bed. Or your favorite chair. Or your desk. The idea is to make it clean so when you're between cleaning times, you can feel better about the area you're in, and this helps give you better energy for extending those cleaning timeframes.

For me, my area is my desk, so the smaller steps will be for that. But the principle applies to anywhere. Or you can skip down to the steps for the room of your choice.

First, gather up dishes and put them in the sink (or directly into the dishwasher if it isn't full). Then the trash. Then loosely organize any papers. Put important papers where you can find them (such as an inbox tray) and other papers in a drawer. Once you start feeling better, you can come back to the drawer later and organize. Finally, grab a cleaning wipe and wipe down the major surfaces of dust.

====================================================================
Step 4: Living Room
====================================================================
Same as the desk area, just make the rounds. Dishes, trash, put away items lying around, wipe surfaces. Again, don't worry if your shelves etc aren't organized. The idea is that everything is off the floor, and nothing that doesn't belong in the room is in the room.

====================================================================
Step 5: Dining Room
====================================================================
Same as the Living Room, just make the rounds. Dishes, trash, put away items lying around, wipe surfaces. Again, don't worry if your shelves etc aren't organized. The idea is that everything is off the floor, and nothing that doesn't belong in the room is in the room.

====================================================================
Step 6: Hallways
====================================================================
Ok, you've managed to get through several major rooms now!! I like to do hallways at this point because generally, there is very little to do. There may be a stray article of clothing, but generally nothing, so it provides an easy task after tackling some big ones as a break.

====================================================================
Step 7: Guest Bathroom [Or only bathroom if you just have one]
====================================================================
Start with putting in the toilet bowl cleaner. While that's sitting and doing it's thing, clear the counter. Put things away properly as much as possible, but if you need to throw some things in a small pile under the sink until you get some organization, that's ok too. Wipe down the counter, and then the toilet. Scrub the bowl. Finish with the tub. Make sure any dirty laundry is thrown into a hamper, basket, or designated pile.

With this bathroom done, you now have all of the public areas of your home cleaned. So if someone comes by (friend, family member or a neighbor), you won't feel embarrassed by the state of your house, which just fuels the depression.

====================================================================
Step 8: Kid's Room(s)
====================================================================
This step is only applicable if you have children, and they are too young to clean their room themselves without some assistance. Even if they understand cleaning up, if they are young, any mess may be overwhelming for them too.
Start with making the bed. This gives you a clean look for a fair chunk of the room right off with minimal effort. Pick up any toys that are around the floor, and put them in their bins. Even if you don't want to sort the toys right now, just getting them into whatever bins/toy chest you have is enough. With the toys out of the way, gathering up dirty clothes to put into your pile(s) and trash gets easier. Make another pass for toys you might have missed.

====================================================================
Step 9: Master Bedroom
====================================================================
Start with making the bed. Again, this gives you a good chunk of your room a clean look for minimal effort. And it's an easy step to try to skip thinking ""well I'm just going to crawl into bed soon, why make it?"" But don't underestimate how much having it made can perk up how the room looks. Next, grab up any dishes that may be floating around. Next, trash. Then dirty clothes. And finally any other items that need to be put away.

====================================================================
Step 10: Master Bathroom and Other Bathrooms
====================================================================
This is assuming you have more than one bathroom. If you don't, and you cleaned the bathroom previously, skip this step. If you have more than 2 bathrooms, do all remaining bathrooms now.

Refer back to Step 7 for the task list.

====================================================================
Step 11: Floors
====================================================================
Ok. Things are going good. You should have your home picked up now. If you have extra rooms that weren't covered here, insert those here, following the same dishes -> trash -> pick up -> wipe down as other rooms.

Now that every room is picked up, running through with a vaccuum for carpeted areas should go pretty quickly. Start with those areas.

Then sweep/mop the kitchen.

Finally sweep/mop the bathrooms.

====================================================================
Step 12: Put the Laundry Away
====================================================================
Time to come full circle back to step one. By now, you should have most of your laundry through the washer/dryer, and all that's left is to put it away. I save this for last because with multiple baskets for clean clothes, I can at least have them in a tidy way without getting through putting them away. And the baskets make it easy to come back at a future day. The main thing is that they are clean for wearing.

First, find a basket or something for socks. Matching socks sucks, and I usually put it off to the end. Dump any you come across in here.
Next, I pull out and fold any towels or small blankets. These are big, fluffy, and easy to fold. This means you can reduce the size of the clean pile by quite a bit, for less effort.
After towels, I do pants. Again, quick, easy, and reduces a good bulk of the clean laundry.
Then I do shirts that are folded. Then items that get hung up.
Finally, underwear.

Now, everything should be folded or on a hanger in neat piles. Run around the house and put these away.

Finally, tackle matching the socks (easy to do while you watch a favorite show).

====================================================================
YOU'RE DONE!!!
====================================================================
Congratulations!! You did it!! And don't let anyone think that this isn't a monumental feat. All of the pain and depression may still be there. But at least your home is clean. You have an accomplishment you can own, and a living space conducive to feeling better about yourself and life.",1416870702.0
317,Depression: the things that have helped me.,"Here are some hard earns things I've found helped me. Take from it what you find useful, leave the rest. Please share your own discoveries of what works for you. 


**Nutrition:**

* Vitamin D.

* Omega 3's. At least 2 grams a day. Maybe a lot more. 

* Probiotic. I drink 500ml of Yakult everyday. I think this has been huge for me. There are recent studies showing how our intestinal bacteria have a massive impact on brain hormones (It's a big sugar dose, but I don't care about that just now. Plus the sweetness greatly increases my daily compliance). 

* Lots of fruits and vegetables. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Personally I find broccoli, bananas, tomato paste, and berries helpful. Walnuts also. 


**Sleep**
I'm naturally a nightowl. Morning are really hard compared to the rest of the day. All attempts to change this have failed. I've found it healthy to embrace it, but still regulate it.

* If like me you find it easy to stay up later and later each night, make sure you go to sleep 1-2 hours before you normally would. You won't feel tired enough to fall asleep immediately, but you'll probably drift off about 20 minutes or so. Learn to enjoy this ""doing nothing"" phase before sleep. 

* Wake up at the same time each day. It is much more important to wake up at the same time than it is to go to bed at the same time. I've found my sleep needs have a sine wave pattern - I don't need the same amount each day. I've found varying when I go to sleep rather than when I wake up to be *much* better for my mood. Also, if you nap, have a fixed time to wake helps stop the naps totally messing up your sleep cycle.  


**Caffeine**

* If you consume caffeine its really important to have some on waking. Have coffee in the house. If you get your coffee ""on the outside"" then on those days you don't want to leave the house, and every depressed person has those days, you don't want to be withdrawing from caffeine with an already bad mental state. 

* Don't over consume stimulants. If you overstimulate your adrenal system you will feel stressed and handle stressors poorly. 


**Nicotine**
I've found its a form of self medication that works for short term relief but and a negative effect on mood in the medium term. I *strongly* recommend either quitting or immediately switching to nicotine gum or patches. Nicotine gum is what I used a few years ago. I found the effect on the body and mind is completely different, not really like what smoking does at all, much more like coffee. If you're not mentally ready to quit nicotine, immediately switch to gum and don't worry about how long you use it - I used gum for over a year. 

**Having good friends helps a lot.** Enough said. 


**Meditation**
I define meditation as the mind-brain doing something to itself on purpose. I think its a grab-bag term for a whole bunch of things you can do. Here are the ones I do, usually just for a few minutes at a time, integrated into my life, not as a formal thing. Personally I think its more important to jump in and *do it, experiment* than to get caught up in theorising about it, reading about it etc (not to say they are mutually exclusive):

* *Mindfulness.* Just watch the contents of my mind in real time, like clouds drifting across the sky. If I, the thinker start contributing thoughts into the stream and I catch myself doing it, it's fine, just don't get sticky, continue to watch the flow of mind, the flow of time. 

* *Generate a positive emotion on purpose.* I pick a positive emotion, often it will be the opposite of the negative feeling that's bothering me, and generate it on purpose. If you do this when its easy, you can then start doing it when its a challenge, such as when starting to stress out, rage etc.

* *Time orientation.* The mind can be orientated towards the past, present, or future. Being able to reorient the mind away from the past to either the present or future is vital. It is also sometimes vital to reorient the mind from the future to the present. 

* *Deliberately leave the ordinary mind into a different mental state.* For me that's getting into my body with my martial arts training, where I can switch over to a kinaesthetically dominated frame of mind.  For someone else that mind be playing the piano. The important thing is that it's not using the verbal/linguistic part of the mind. 

* *Deliberate positive yet reasonable thoughts*. These are like positive affirmations, but not, those just seem too fake to me. The idea here is to listen and identify the negative self-talk we have and deliberately construct a counter statement to say to ourselves that combats it. The negative self talk comes in two types: stuff that's spontaneous, and stuff that is played in the mind with the exact same phrasing, the same emotional vibe, like a recording. Both are handled roughly the same way. I'll give an example. Something, say someone is rude to me, triggers the thought: ""The world sucks, people are jerks"". I'll run that past myself (and not the emotional part, but the rational part) and then craft the statement ""Some of the world suck but most of it doesn't, and only some people are rude, some of the time. Most people are good"". The real important thing here is you make run it past your rational mind and it must agree with it, if it doesn't you have to try constructing another statement your rational mind can agree with. That's what stops this being that positive thinking hypnosis bull. 

**Exercise**

*Resistance Exercise.* This seems to give me symptoms very similar to *overtraining* but far, far quicker and more easily than it does for other people. Symptoms include a weakened immune system (I get a URTI almost without fail if I start lifting weights) and all the various depression symptoms.  I strongly suspect that this is a much wider problem in the general community than is currently recognised (though its a spectrum thing, not all or nothing) and especially common amongst those with depression and/or anxiety disorders. I still haven't given up on experimenting with this (because I want bigger muscles), but I may have to as I've tried dozens of times, tweaking variables, but without success. 

*Aerobic/Cardiovascular exercise*. Greatly improves my mood and reduces my depression symptoms.  

**Yes, It's a disease but it's not that simple.**
A vulnerability to depression strongly runs on both sides of my family. It also seems to be the type of depression that doesn't respond well to anti depressants. We inherit via nature vulnerabilities to depression. Often the very genes that predispose us to depression give us gifts as well. There is the Orchid theory which suggests that if you raise a Orchid type person in the right environment they shine, but in the wrong and they are damaged by it. I think there is truth in this. 

We also inherit culturally. We learn from our mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters. We learn from our peers. We learn at school. More to the point, we *don't learn*, there is an absence, a real lack in our education. We are not taught the psychological skills and life skills needed to cope with the challenges of life and of managing our depression vulnerable brains.

So what do we do? We must give ourselves the knowledge and skills we should have been given by our parents, our schools and our culture.

You are not depressed because of your brain chemistry. It's not that simple. You may have a vulnerability to depression, but that's not the same thing as our genes making you depressed in a simple, direct deterministic fashion.  There are feedback loops between our brain chemistry and the rest of the mind-brain, and with the external world. Interfere in those loops in anyway you see fit. If drugs help great, if not, try other stuff, such as the stuff this post is about.  There are right and wrong answers but they are likely to be highly specific to each individual. Experiment, see what works for you. 


**The need for a meaningful life**
Depressed people have a greater ability to see reality more accurately. The see just how shitty things are. What might make the average person happy might not make you happy. Most people's lives are trivially lived, they are only concerned with creature comforts, social status, and money. I believe these are not sufficient to make a depressed person happy. You need to be pursuing a life *you* find meaningful. 95% of jobs/careers just aren't going to provide that to any sane person. Which makes it hard. What makes it *even harder* is you still need to be doing something that gains people's respect. This is a hardwired primate brain thing. No way around it.  A really depressed person isn't coping with life very well, and everyone around him/her wants them to just get back to ""normal"". But normal isn't going to cut it. Because a depressed person will look at ""normal"" people with there normal live and think ""what's so great about that?"" You need to aim for something *you* find meaningful.


**Low Social Status and a Life of Meaning**
I touched on this above in the section of meaning. Low social status may be the biggest risk factor depression. I'll put it bluntly. ""Depression"" is what being a loser feels like. So don't be a loser. Look at this world and the way it is structured, sees who gets respect and who doesn't, e.g., teaching is one of the noblest professions but they don't earn much money so they aren't respected. If someone's sense of a meaningful life is shallow - they want creature comforts, social status and money - then they can fit into this world easily. But a depressed person wants comforts, social status and money, but they *also* want a meaningful life, so its more difficult for them. They can work 40-60 hours in a cubicle doing work they find tedious, boring and meaningless and earn money and social status and not be a *loser* but they will be dying on the inside and probably won't be able to keep at it for decades. Alternatively, maybe you pursue a path that is meaningful but the social status is delayed and won't come for years, or maybe decades, in this case will have to pay the price of not having social status. 

So to summarise this section: don't be a loser, be a success, but it has to be according to your own system of meaning. This is difficult to do with the way the world is structured but you don't really have a choice as the alternatives are worse. I welcome discussion of this section especially.

318,"How to get over a ""friend breakup""?","Friendships can end miserably, amiably, wordlessly, etc.

What things do you guys do to stave off the pain?

A situation arose that made me seek answers out. 

Been friends with someone for a few years- we've shared a lot of passions, life updates and advice, support and encouragement, etc...

But during the past year, they got caught up in a lot of personal things - chasing after a potential romantic partner, got involved with new friends, etc. , and started to talk to me a lot less.

I am fine with that, actually. BUT.

What really got to me was that we got into two ""fights"". I will not disclose the specifics, in fear of them finding this thread/account.

But as a TLDR, both times, it was me  bringing up something they did or said that hurt me. I genuinely did my best to not be aggressive. I just wanted to bring it up and talk about it fairly, and to understand their side of the story as well. 

They exploded both times, and stopped talking to me for three months each time. 

When we would start talking again, we would discuss what happened. And both times, they seemed to turn the narrative around,  blaming me for everything and ignoring all the points of how I felt. Basically, whenever there is some kind of fault that is theirs, they get highly upset and twist it around - ultimately making me the ""bad guy."" 


We were such great friends, but something in this person changed. I genuinely thought they would be understanding and we could talk it out...but apparently not.


With this second round of seeing the same behavior, I think I'm done with this friendship. But man, it hurts... especially being as someone who doesn't have many clos frinds.

322,how do I (28m) get over her?,"It's been two years since she left me, about a year since the divorce. She left me for someone else. We were together for 8 and a half years, I thought we seemed happy for most of it. She gave up so quickly. Said she loved him before we got married. The last week she used to put a lot of issues on me saying I was the cause of all of them. I know I wasn't perfect but many problems I couldn't do anything about, some if she had just talked to me I would have tried to change them. I still dream about her from time to time. I still think about it all playing events back in my head, questioning whether she ever even loved me in the first place, questioning whether I even deserve love. I worked hard to try to improve myself, working out consistently for the first time ever losing weight getting a job which pays more that either of us have ever gotten paid. I still think about her with him. Last night I dreamt we were together again. I wish I could just forget her. It still annoys me too, the letter she sent to absolve herself, the excuses made and the blame she pinned on me for things I did try to do and that she refused to (like communicating). I'm starting to realize how toxic she was, how emotionally abusive at times, but how do I tell my heart that so it stops breaking every time I think about her?",1655759502.0
323,How do/did you stop gatekeeping yourself?,"I noticed this about a lot of people who try to lose weight and about many people with mental illnesses. I am depressed and also trying to lose weight and get fitter. Or at least I wish to.

Often I hear or think:  
\- I will get a nice dress when I am thin.  
\- I will go to the beach with my beach body, when I have it. I can't wear a bathing suit now.  
\- I will date again, when I am better.  
\- I will go to a XYZ class when I am better.  


It is rationalized with:  
\- I don't have money now.  
\- I can't do it yet.   
\- I will get treated badly because of my body.  
\- My friends won't enjoy me because of my mood.  


But waiting to do the things you dream of and that make you feel good will make matters worse.   
Not going to the fitness studio, beach or pool because of body shame will not get you the body you want. Isolating yourself will not help your relationships. Yet, we do it. We say ""later"" and it will become ""never"", because waiting stops us from actually working towards it.

I reckon understanding, that you are doing thisis the first step.  
But ""Just do it."" is not a valid second step. If we could, more would.

324,"Today I learned that sometimes, there really is an actual reason I feel this way","So, for years I’ve suffered from bouts of what I thought was depression but I think was really more anxiety. It always seemed to come out of the blue with no explanation or reason. It was always so frustrating. 

Today, for the first time, I was able to figure out an actual reason for the way I am feeling this particular time. My beautiful, insightful wife help me realize that my (quite self-centered, helpless and demanding) 77-year-old single mom is unhealthily dependent on me and that I (an only son) have a hugely overdeveloped sense of responsibility for my mom’s happiness. 

It all stems from being an 8-year-old with a needy, emotionally damaged single mom after a contentious divorce. I became her helper, friend and confidant. Then I moved to my dad’s at age 13 because it was a healthier environment which broke my mom’s heart. 

This has led to me always running around to help my mom even as her demands and health issues have become more and more difficult while I also balance my wife, kids, job and health. 

I can’t tell you how freeing it was to have the dots connected for me in this way. It was like the heavens parted and a huge sense of relief washed over me. Now I know I need to set my boundaries for both of our sakes. 

This experience makes me think that, while I may have mood issues, perhaps when I am really suffering it may be because some area of my life is WAY out of alignment. I’ve also been dragging along at a job I hate with a boss I hate for almost four years now. I think that situations like these cause me chronic stress which I manage as best I can but then it reaches a breaking point which manifests itself as anxiety and feelings of hopelessness. I know this doesn’t sound that revolutionary but it really was for me. 

From now on, when I hit a real dip, I will start searching my life for areas of major dissonance and do my best to improve them. 

The other funny part of this story is that earlier this weekend when I was crying from anxiety exhaustion, I thought “who can I pray to, since I don’t believe in God?” So I prayed to my dad, who died in 2013. I’ve gotta say that it sure felt like he was answering a prayer by putting words of wisdom in my wife’s mouth about this situation. Thanks Dad!

Anyways, I hope this is encouraging to someone out there.",1626074590.0

Things got extremely dark this week and I relapsed last night. For some reason though, today I gained this immense clarity and inspiration, and while I had it in me I made a list of goals to improve myself for the rest of this new year

The first thing I did was delete all my saved porn, which I realize has been destroying a lot of aspects of my life and my control over it. My next step is going to be to start abiding by a consistent *and healthy* sleep schedule while taking the transition slowly. I've been consistently going to sleep at around 4 or 5 AM and waking up 12 or more hours later, getting next to no sunlight in my day. Today I set an alarm for noon and am going to ease my way into waking up at earlier and earlier times, while also getting the right amount of sleep. I'm also going to go through my list and organize everything. I want to be able to compartmentalize everything so I don't risk burnout. Completing this list will help me figure out what I want my schedule for every day to look like once I've fixed my sleeping patterns. I want to be able to be as productive as possible while also being as stress-free as possible. Organization is key in this I think

I was raised in a very conventional household so straight up being a game developer was not an option. So I chose the next best thing - Computer Science.
After working hard for months and months, I finally landed a technical interview with a well known gaming company and I completely completely botched it today because literally, I was just too nervous and blanked out for a solid 15 mins.

So I’ve recently released my first music video, called ‘Use me’. It deals with bulimia, my abusive relationship, struggling to conform to the increasing pressures of society, drugs, mental health and fun things like that.
I was formerly a high fashion model, which massively fucked me up, and I suffered with anorexia and then bulimia. I later bought my way out of my contract as I recognised I was no longer willing to, quite literally, change myself for other people.
At the same time, I was in an incredibly toxic relationship which also completely fucked me up. I kept trying to leave. I tried and I tried and I tried. And then one day I was sick and tired of being sick and tired and I upped and left.
In this video, I am portrayed as all the people that the modelling industry / my ex wanted me to be. 
Ultimately, it’s about empowerment and leaving toxic shit behind.

328,"Envy of other artists (Skill, age, or both) has affected me so bad I can no longer look at or enjoy other people's work for years. How do I practice getting over this?","I'm in my thirties, a college dropout, and have landed a few brief indie freelance positions on projects as an artist, animator, and UI designer on indie shorts and games (Most were never released and 2 came out with little fanfare and zero net gain).  But friends and strangers both IRL and online seem to be pulling off success and recognition with few issues, and more and more of them seem to be achieving it fresh out of college or soon after, or those who are my age have already found their place and comfortable spot and skill level professionally.

This wasn't a big issue in college or my early 20s, but about 5 years ago I had a quarter-life crisis and something in me basically broke.  I no longer look at great works and all the high views/likes/follows they get and feel joy to experience it and admiration for the creators, but with envy and regret for being unable to experience anything remotely similar, and instead spreading myself thin across three jobs in an attempt to save up some money (Still failing at this) while also cramming in hours every day and night where I practice my artwork and gradually add to my portfolio.

Since I'm sensible enough to recognize lashing out at those I'm envious of as uncalled for, immature, and cruel, my mind takes it out on myself mentally.  Now, every time I see something, my mind just goes ""That could be you.  You could have had that lifestyle and joy by now, but instead you have nothing, you failure.""  I haven't felt genuine happiness in months because of it, and have closed all my social media accounts and dramatically cut down on talking to anyone because of it.  Living alone, being single, and having nothing else going on in my life despite countless attempts doesn't help the resulting loneliness, misery, and FOMO either.  The problem's extended to stuff like TV, movies and games I used to view as entertainment and escapism; now they all make me miserable, because I just wish I could work on some of them and feel productive and stable.

Talking about this with friends and family hasn't helped, even when many of the IRL people I envy have disclosed a lot of their own problems and insecurities to me.  Neither has discussing it in therapy.  Truthfully, the most common answer I'm getting at this point is ""From what you're saying, it totally makes sense and you're right to feel this way"", which is an unproductive and toxic view to me since I want to get back to both enjoying and being inspired by this stuff and interacting with its creators, rather than stifling my enjoyment and experience of it and isolating myself from everyone.  I'm continuing to try and make up for lost/miserable time by constantly practicing and working on my craft while shut away from everyone, but even though I've been growing confidence that I can eventually make it (At least if recent comments by colleagues and professionals from what I've shown them are any indication), I'm still super miserable with everything and even making myself tired and sick due to overwork, lack of sleep, and overall exhaustion and burnout.

And he used to tell me how he couldn't handle my depression because it was going to drag him back down to the depths and actually run away at any more than innocuous sign of emotion.
   * Now I cry far more rarely and for much better reasons. When I do cry it's usually with friends or my therapist who comfort me and tell me that I'm just being human.
* I used to be so afraid to be alone. I thought that if he wouldn't have me that not many would want me. I would go crazy spending a night in silence.
   * Now I live alone with my young son. Once he is in bed at night I feel at peace being alone. I feel happy to get to watch what I want or work on what I want at night.
* I used to believe I was a negative angry person when that was projected on me whether by friends or by Nexes. I used to accept all of the blame for the negativity they pinpointed onto me.
   * I now know that I am a kind and positive happy person, who loves to compliment others (when they deserve it) and make others feel empowered and valuable. I also know that I will call out BS and defend what I believe is right when I see it and that there is nothing wrong with that.
* I used to believe my expectations were probably too high, as I was told they were, or that it was incorrect to have expectations at all.
   * I now believe that it is GOOD ad healthy to have STANDARDS and BOUNDARIES, and if someone doesn't meet them or crosses them purposely and malice-fully more than once, that they don't deserve you.
* I used to think I was not good enough. Pretty enough, smart enough, productive enough or interesting enough.  Not a good enough mom, daughter, or partner.
   * I now see that when someone gives me the chance to be there for them that I am through and through. That I am not only ENOUGH, but I am a damn good person to have in your corner.
* I used to care more what everyone else, even those that had no power over me thought of me. I used to think that to be a good mom I had to PROVIDE my son a father figure (even if not the best one) since his was negligent.
   * I realize now that my son doesn't NEED a man in his life on a daily basis to turn him into a good man. I now only care what my mentors and bosses think because that actually has an affect, and it turns out they like me just as much single.
* I used to think that you were a victim, and that people that told stories of their victimhood the most should be given a break, not treated like everyone else and shown disproportionate empathy.
   * I now realize that those that speak their stories of victimhood the most are usually the perpetrators and not victims of anything else except their own crimes and decisions. The story you hear first or the most is usually the wrong one.
* I used to believe you that your ex-wife was crazy and horrible and jealous of me, yet my intuition also shook at how horrible I saw you acting towards her, although I thought you had good reason. I used to believe you that she was a horrible mother even though I never saw her be anything but kind to the child that I grew to love as my own.
   * I now know that when she didn't look at or talk to me it was because she was angry and traumatized and I was being used as a flying monkey in her continued abuse. I now see that she always acted as the bigger person even when you stooped as low as possible to get vengeance on her. I now see how horrible it was that you literally got her arrested for getting medicaid to cover the bill for the child you ASKED for, by saying she committed fraud by knowingly leaving out your income, yet you did not pay a dime for the child's birth. I am now glad she finally won custody back from you because the child looks so much happier and healthier now surrounded by extended family.
* I used to think you were just finding a commiserators and friends and good allies by communicating with your ex-wifes previous ex husband, new exes, ect.
   * I now know that you are all crazy Narcs because she has unfortunately fallen for a few of your kind, and hadn't learned the lesson of why yet, and find your plotting with them against her on the phone for hours just plain crazy and evil. 
* I used to be so angry at your family for abandoning you in your time of need. I used to think of your sister and aunt as horrible for never meeting your child. Yet, I know see that they disowned you because of how horrible you were to them and how you just expected more from them even though your aunt had already handed you thousands of dollars. I used to feel bad that you couldn't afford to go to your grandmothers funeral across the country.
   * I now see that you can suddenly afford to stalk someone (me) across the ocean when there is a creepy motivation there and that you always have money for what you want. Yet, you were letting me pay your mortgage while acting poor and sick just to extract from me.
* I used to think I really had the disease or chemical imbalance of depression. I had no motivation to work around the house (that you always threatened to kick me out of), I lost motivation to be a good step mom, I didn't want to work or even get out of bed. I believed that this was because there was something chemically wrong with my brain. I used to think it took large amounts of adrenaline to make me ""normal"" because you told me I was fake at our mutual hobby/workplace that is an adrenaline inducing activity. I used to really want to die (passive suicidal ideation) often.
   * I now realize that I am not a depressed person at all. I realize that I am happy and that there is hardly any yelling or even harsh tones in the words spoken in my household when it is just my son and I. I have a lot of motivation to not only decorate and homemake but to clean and get my child to school on time. That the person I am at the place that is now MY job, is who I am when I am free. I love my life and want to live it fruitfully for as long as possible.
* I used to feel flattered that someone in a higher position in our industry than me and older than me wanted me. 
   * I now realize that it is creepy that he has to have that much power over someone in order to obtain them.
* I used to believe everything you said she did to you during the divorce and think it was her fault the divorce was taking so long.
   * I got to see for myself that you literally did everything TO me that you said she was doing to you and that it was you all along doing it to her too and that you like to prolong disputes as long as possible.
* I used to feel guilty when you would use God against me. I used to be scared when you would angrily blame God in your prayers.
   * I am no longer Christian even though I do believe there is something more transcendent than us that we just are too small to know what it is. I know I have it too good in this world to be angry at anything transcendent and blame it for ""not just giving me a break."" 
* I used to feel stupid that I would keep bringing up your last ex  before me who I thought you cheated on me with and that you still were interested in. I used to think I was overly insecure and jealous, because obviously I had already ""won"" (LOST in life tho) since you had asked me to move in and were going to marry me. I used to try and justify it with myself that you really forgot about those naked photos that were so easy to find of her. 
   * Now that you are engaged to the very same person you once denounced and did nothing but talk shit about to MANY people, I realize that I was not stupid or over-jealous that I was just intuitive and that you were playing that triangle on purpose to make yourself look in demand. I realize now that normal people do not TRY to make their partner jealous and then forbid them to be jealous.
* I used to believe  you must really be sick with a bad disease to not want to have sex with me and that I was just an overly horny asshole. 
   * I now realize you were NEVER sick you just needed an excuse for your weight gain and laziness of NOT WORKING for months. You were depressed because you knew I was too good for you and too smart and that I would eventually figure you out and you would not get to keep me on a chain forever. 
* I used to be turned off by people that acted TOO interested in me and needed to fight for a relationship to feel like it was worth fighting for.
   * I now don't mind having fun trusted friends with benefits, yet I don't want the added responsibility of any relationship. 
* I used to think loosing you would be the worst thing in the world.
   * I now have spent over a year and a half running AWAY from you and wish that I could just loose everything about you.
* I used to want to have him actually marry me and have a baby with him since we both had our own children from previous marriages because I believed it would make us a more cohesive family unit. I believed these things would give me the extra security in the relationship that he never did since he was constantly threatening the relationship and breaking up with me.
   * I now see that I not only dodged a bullet, but that I dodged a whole damn freaking magazine! I am happy with my one child at the age he is (older elementary) and really don't want any more. 
* I used to believe people N friends, N mom, or Nexes when they put me down under the guise of ""caring"" so much that they had to be honest. Whether it be about my weight, my ""anger issues"", my out of control-ness, ect.
   * I now realize that is how they can put you down without looking like the bad guy. That yes I am ""out of control"" meaning that my spirit is just TOO MUCH (in a good way I see now) to be CONTROLLED and that I never want it to again. 
* I used to be pretty miserable in life all together. Whether living with my N mother, or my nexes.

333,How I got over my depression/anxiety,"I thought I would post how I got over my depression/anxiety with the hope that it would be able to help someone else. I will note that while this worked for me I can't say it will work for everyone. I do believe that mental illness is a highly personal disease that is a combination of genetic and environmental factors unique to each individual.

I won't go into what initially triggered my anxiety and depression because for me personally I don't think it's really relevant. What I eventually realized after several years was that it didn't matter what triggered my mental illness as I was far more upset with how I felt internally than anything that happened to me externally.

To give you some background my family does have a history of mental illness and I was generally quite anxious growing up. In college I felt my world slip away as I developed constant panic attacks and depressive episodes. Depersonalization, extreme vertigo, nausea, inability to sleep were just some of my physical symptoms but the worst was the constant transition between extreme fear and complete numbness in my own mind. This ebbed and flowed with some periods being better and others being worse for a couple of years. I avoided taking medication because I didn't want to settle for ""masking"" my symptoms. I wanted to get better and I was very worried that if medication didn't work I effectively had no lifeline left. I did try CBT and this would form the basis of how I was able to move on from anxiety and depression for good.

What took me several years of trial and error to understand was that my brain was effectively caught in a negative feedback loop. I was scared because I hated how I felt when I had panic attacks and I couldn't control them. I was sad that I felt sad all the time and I had little hope of getting better because I believed I was born a defective person. 

I actively tried to get better by exercising, quitting caffeine, quitting all drugs and alcohol, meditating, taking vitamin d, forcing myself out of bed each day in order to interact with other people. It all helped a bit but nothing was a cure. I wanted to believe that I had the ability to control my depression and anxiety but I just didn't. 

It took an epiphany while I was running on a hot and humid day to realize that I had essentially forgotten to feel bad. It was really quite simple I had broken the loop by becoming so distracted that I forgot how terrible my life had become. While my depression and anxiety quickly returned I realized I could simply try my best not to react to it. I still felt shitty but I stopped obsessing about how bad I felt and pretty quickly it started to get better. Within 2 weeks I was manageable but still hurting, 2 months I was back to a semi-reasonable state and 2 years later I was more calm and happy then I ever was before becoming clinically depressed. 

It's been probably 10 years now since I've felt anything close to depression or anxiety and I'm an incredibly content person by anyone's standards. I know how this post might be taken in the wrong way. I'm not saying it's as easy as acting more optimistic and your depression will suddenly disappear. I do believe though that depressed and anxious people tend to assume the worst and develop a sense of learned helpless. For me it took repeated CBT lessons and an epiphany to figure out that I could control my own emotional state and move past my depression and anxiety. I strongly encourage those that are trying to get over their own mental illness to reject the notion that it's something to be merely managed and start actively looking to control your own emotional state. Stoicism, CBT, and Mindful Meditation are all fields of study you can use to get the actual mechanics right. 

I wish everyone the best of luck and encourage you not to be too hard on yourself if you're not there yet. It takes time just keep trying.",1513978076.0

I take medication prescribed from my psychiatrist and have still been ""Meh"" every day. I go to support groups and have a great family but not really any emotionally supportive friends.

I want to share with everyone struggling something I am doing now that I noticed I feel much better. So I read that exercise, sunlight, vitamin B and D and that help depression. I didn't believe in this for a long time because I didn't like the gym and didn't feel good (social anxiety).

However, they mentioned I cannot wait and hope my pills fix me, because without lifestyle changes I will not get better. So I finally decided to do this plan.
I will take a walk every morning and wake up at 9am. It does not matter how far or long the walk is, just that I do it. I will go to bed every night at 1 for my 8 hour sleep. I will take my medication and vitamins (D, fish oil, B complex, Multivitamin) every morning. The things I have to get done, I decided I will do a little bit every day because one day it will be finished, I just have to do it no matter how little every day.

After doing this, I started feeling better. I actually enjoyed my walk outside, I enjoy the things I used to again, and I actually felt a little happy for the first time in a long time. It was amazing honestly. My family cooks healthy right now so that helps me out a lot too.

I wanted to share this because it's really helping me out. I feel like I can fight my depression and do something about it, easier though by not pressing myself to get a certain amount done, just to do something. If your interested I recommend you read and try this stuff, then see how you feel. Thank you :).",1484687377.0
336,Don't go through a tough time alone - connect 1-to-1 anonymously to destigmatize mental health.,"My team and I created an application because we believe that no one should have to endure a tough time alone.

We use an algorithm to match people based on both emotion and experience to chat anonymously. There's no catch, and I'd be happy to swap my journey through depression either here or through the application itself.

If it isn't what you are looking for, I'd love to hear how my team and I can create technology for your purpose. Going through depression was one of the hardest things I had to go through and I'm dedicated to helping other's through whatever means possible.

All day, I feel like I’m living my life in boundaries of past, regrets and worries for the future. Sometime I don’t feel like I’m living life in present moment. It’s like my thinking is elsewhere while talking with someone. Idk if it’s anxiety or lack of confidence in myself.

And often, if I'm not doing that, I overcompensate in the other direction, and tell myself that I'm better than everyone else.

The problem isn't that ""nothing"" interests me, it's rather that i don't find anything that interests me enough. I kind of feel like my emotions are toned down at all times. 

For an example, if a friend tells me he/she finally found a job i just pretend to be excited. I want to be excited, but i'm just not. 

Used to be a huge fan of games, now it's boring. I can't get myself to study things that i used to be excited about. Sex doesn't even interest me anymore.

343,I didn't break the cycle,"I want to live. 

All I do is slide down and crawl up again. I’m tired. I’m scared.

I thought I’d finally broken the cycle. I found a better therapist and I recovered. I finally found some structure in my life, and learned some new tools to prevent regression. But my depressive episodes come so gradually that despite all I learned, I was up to my neck again before I even noticed I was sinking. And the strategies to get me out are hardest to remember at the exact moment I need them most. 

But I’ll get over this, like I got over the last dozens of times. 

And every time I finally crawl out, I find another part of myself permanently missing. I don’t have much episodic memory left, I’m not as smart as I once was, decision making is becoming increasingly difficult and I’m becoming emotionally numb. But most importantly, I’m slowly losing my sense of wonder, my curiosity, my sense of play – my life force – the thing that powers me through my struggles with daily life, social skills and communication.

I’ll get over this one, and the next, and probably the one after that. But there will be a point where there’s not enough left. And that scares me to no end.

When I get over this episode, I’ll have to change my life, because this isn’t working. I need more routine, I need to get out of my head, and I need to find more ways of being around people without draining myself.

I’m the past, this could last anywhere from a couple weeks to a few months. Needless to say, I hate it and am in a bit of a panic to try to get out of it quickly. 

In the past, I always quickly told my wife when I was fighting mood issues. She’s very understanding and gives practical advice. However, when I tell her, I sometimes worry that it makes the whole episode last longer because now someone else knows. It makes me self-conscious about it and think about it more.

351,Depressed girlfriend cut herself because of something I said,"I (26/m) think I've posted on this subreddit before about having a girlfriend (25/f) with depression. Anyways, something happened today again and I can't help shake the feeling of guilt and shame for the end result.

My girlfriend struggles with depression and has self harming tendencies. Being with her sometimes feels like walking on egg shells because you'll never know when something you or someone else said will set off her depression.

She also has some problems with time management. This trait of hers has been something I've learned to live with and accept, but it doesn't mean it never frustrates me. 

Today, we agreed that we would go out for lunch at a restaurant we've always wanted to try. We both agreed that I would come pick her up at the agreed time. A while before I was supposed to go pick her up, I texted her to check if she's still fine with it. No response.

It got closer and closer to the time I was supposed to go get her, then she finally replied that she's still in bed and hasn't gotten ready.

I was annoyed. However, I decided that I just want to let it go and enjoy my date with her. It still took time though. I can't just cool off immediately and that's how the problem began. When I finally picked her up, she could see that I was not in the happiest mood. I sure wasn't telling her off, but I was a lot less talkative as we drove. Again, I intend to cool off but it still takes some time to do it.

When we got to the restaurant and finished ordering, she asked me ""Am I annoyed?"". 

I replied ""A bit... But I'll get over it and you know I can't stay annoyed at you for long babe.""

That was when everything started to come crashing down.

She started to cry. I didn't get it. She asked me something and I thought I answered truthfully and lovingly. She stopped talking altogether and it felt kinda awkward for the rest of the time we were eating. 

After we finished, I sent her home and dropped by to see her family (this is something I always do whenever I drop her off). Things only got worse from then on. She went back to her room and slammed the door shut. Her parents asked me what happened. Embarrassingly, I explained the whole situation and apologised for causing this.

Honestly, her parents treat me with so much compassion, especially her mother. She forgave me and told me about how my girlfriend is very sensitive to negative feedback and it hurts a lot more coming from me because she loves me so much. I had a great time talking to her while I waited for my girlfriend to cool down.

A few hours later she texted me from her room asking if I was ""still annoyed"". I said ""of course not"". She asked ""then are you expecting me to come out and talk?"".

That sounded a bit rude, but whatever. I told her parents that I'll go check on her. To my horror, I saw that she cut herself. She lied on her bed, just silently tapping her phone. I noticed the cut marks on her hands and feet. I asked ""can you tell me what happened?"" but she shut me off and kept silent.

The tension really is building up in me. What do I do now? Do I stay here until she responds, or do I leave and let her cool off? Either way, I immediately went to tell her parents. They were shocked and worried. I myself couldn't take this anymore and started crying my eyes out in front of them, asking for forgiveness. I never thought just a small comment could cascade into something like this.

Once again, her mother showed me so much love and compassion. She told me that they themselves do not fully understand her and that they made tons of mistakes learning how to communicate with her and to avoid setting off her depression and self harming tendencies.

I spoke to her older brother and some of our closest mutual friends about this. They reminded me that I can't guilt and shame myself because it really isn't my fault. Easier said than done though. I can't help feel that I have her blood on my hands for this. What do I do now? I feel so lost and shameful...",1591534626.0

357,Going down the exact same career path as boyfriend. How do I stop feeling anxious?,"This post didn’t seem right on r/relationship_advice so I spent a while searching for a better place for it to go and found this sub. 

So I (26F) have been dating this guy (23M) for 2 years now, and we are generally pretty happy together. I started my career in tech before I met him but recently have been working in a niche field within tech that happens to be what my boyfriend does. 

Despite him being younger, he’s much more developed in his career, loves the subject, and is really good at it. I am not nearly as naturally inclined, but for reasons I won’t discuss here, it will be difficult to change my trajectory for the next year. Also, I’m still early in my career so i feel it’s important to not keep jumping around (as I had been for the last two years) in different roles. 

I know it sounds terrible, but being with him and talking about tech stuff makes me feel really insecure about my career. I love this guy, and want to be with him for a long time, but it can feel very discouraging when I think of my own career in comparison with his. It’s a mixture of envy and hopelessness. It makes sharing our days at work difficult too since he knows all about what I’m working on at any given time, and sometimes I just don’t want that kind of technical discussion when I get home. 

I’ve told him about these issues, and there is absolutely no blame I put on him for any of this. I recognize it’s something I have to work out with myself. I try my hardest to be supportive of his career and I am proud of his hard work. 

However I feel constant strain on my self image and it manifests in unintended ways. For example I started trying not to talk to him about work, and he thought I was growing cold with him. Or we sometimes get invited to the same events (it’s a small community), and I just don’t feel like we can both be there together, because it feels like stepping on his toes, so I don’t go. Sometimes it’s very positive though, and we can talk shop a little, and share crazy stories that we both understand because of the shared context, and  other times it’s anxiety inducing. 

It gets to the point where I don’t know if I want to pursue this career, and I almost wish I had a few years to figure out where I want to be career-wise before I met this guy.

365,Being in university while having a mental illness,"Im currently trying to complete my bachelors degree so that I can get into a masters program like occupational therapy. Most of the people my age have finished their degree last year. 

A bit of background Ive known Ive had depression since the age of 12 but due to stigma and ignorance on the part of my parents I relied on google and sleep to deal with it till the age of 18. This is when i got help from my schools counselor and got on meds. 

Since then ive had many ups and downs... Having things under control and getting great grades to semesters where I drop two of my classes and then get c's on my three other courses. 

I have two finals tomorrow and Ive accepted Im not going to get the grades I want and my gpa will go down. I thought that once i got help things would get better but in reality its been a struggle of ups and downs and learning how to cope so that my grades dont suffer. A couple months ago i felt like I was fighting a hopeless battle and took an over dose of my perscription. 

However now I dont want to give up. To get into the program I want I need at least a 3.6 gpa or higher and right now I have a 3.2 ( which will probably go down after tomorrow ) 

Although I cant get over how much money and time its taking me to finish my degree, bring my gpa up. Im in my fifth year right now and the way things are might have to do a sixth year to bring my grades up. Im 22 and I feel like Im wasting my 20's. Not to mention the pressure of family asking why Im not done school yet. 

Any helpful kind words are appreciated

366,"Nothing I do makes me happy with my life, even the stuff that makes me happy","I really have no idea what to title this, nor could I accurately give a Tl;dr version of what I'm going through. Brevity will only lead to misunderstandings and get me nowhere, so I'm just going to go into as much detail as possible about why I'm so unhappy with my life right now. And yes, *I welcome any and all suggestions on how to solve this problem.* Seriously, I need all the assistance I can get.

When I say ""Nothing I do makes me happy with my life,"" I'm not exaggerating, at least not consciously. I *do* have a lot going for me: a loving family, good grades at university, some friends to hang out with, a bright future as an engineer, some personal achievements as a university debate team member, etc. I can still have a good time at a party. I laugh on a semi-regular basis. My hygiene is better than many people's, as I try brushing my teeth and washing my face at least once a day during the weekdays and shower & shave at least two times a week, if not three. People generally seem to like me and appreciate my presence. All that's fine and dandy.

But none of those things are enough for me to feel satisfied with myself. It's not even really an issue with appearance or social interaction like when I was in high school. It's the fact that no matter what I do to try to make myself feel sustained happiness or engage myself in a new, exciting hobby, it fails, *even if I truly do enjoy it in the moment.*

Right now, my ""hobbies"" include watching YouTube videos, many of which I've seen dozens of times already; scrolling through Twitter and occasionally Reddit; searching for pornography (most of which doesn't do it for me); and worst of all, pacing around my room fantasizing about things I want to do as if they were already completed: YouTube videos, music, short films, thinkpieces, creative writing, and even connecting with my old internet friends. I've tried to expand my horizons with new hobbies - especially creative ones - but when the fantasizing is over, it doesn't matter if I actually like doing said hobby because I always drop it shortly afterwards. Any happiness or high I get from doing them doesn't last for very long after I finish. This includes reading books, watching movies, listening to albums, writing songs, knitting, cross-stitch, writing scripts for videos (God forbid making them), playing video games in general, practicing a specific video game (*Smash Bros.*) in the hopes of getting good at it, learning to draw, learning Japanese... I could probably go on for longer, but you get the idea by this point. It's no wonder why I'm less motivated than ever to smoke or do drugs; they're not gonna be any different from the temporary bursts of happiness I get on the rare occasions when I'm actually down to do something interesting.

It really does feel like I'm incapable of sustaining a personal growth activity or recreational activity, and it's even worse if the activity is actually enjoyable because I always feel like an idiot in that case. I keep trying new things in the hope that something, anything will keep me going for months, if not years, but I don't even get past the first several weeks in most cases. So I'm stuck with shitting around on the internet, and that's starting to get old, too. When I'm older, will I even be doing anything beyond work and basic life maintenance?

My only university extracurricular is the university debate team, which is fine enough. I like debating, so it's good, I guess. At one point, I really felt like I was connected to the team, like I was a part of something big. Now, I find myself wandering around the meeting room after practice to see all the clusters of people conversing in the vain, useless hope that I'll have something remotely interesting to add or learn something unique. I no longer feel like I'm part of a family, but rather a collection of acquaintances. Even the closest friends I have on the team are, on a good day, no closer than the people from high school who I was friends with. In other words, they're cool for hanging out with, but I wouldn't ever confide my dark secrets to them or anything.

I've tried countless times to explain this to my mother, and she keeps interpreting it as if I have multiple hobbies I switch between and am overreacting to that. That's not my problem at all. My problem also has nothing to do with a lack of interest, by hype. My problem is that I have *no* hobbies and have been completely unable to come up with one that has stuck.

Even when I was suicidal in high school and hated my appearance and whatnot, at the very least, on most school days, I could look forward to my time at home. I could watch cartoons, play video games, catch a movie on TV or Blu-ray, make videos or silly picture edits, talk to my many internet friends (and girlfriend for a time), or spend the night scrolling through Tumblr - only, this is much different from the Twitter situation because at the time, I had a pretty solid following on the platform thanks to my fandom contributions and silly meme videos and pictures. Nowadays, what do I have to look forward to during a boring university lecture? What am I anxious to do once my classes for the day are over? *Absolutely nothing.* I don't like to watch cartoons or movies much anymore, I almost never play video games, I'm single, my internet friend group has been whittled down to a single guy I'm all but attached to at this point, I have trouble even mustering up the energy to make a joke video or edit, and I've nearly abandoned my Tumblr because I just don't like using it anymore. Not being suicidal anymore is certainly an improvement, but I still strongly believe my life has gotten significantly worse since the end of high school.

Again, that's not to say I don't have *interests;* I have plenty. I can talk at length and in great detail about a number of different topics: animation, film, competitive *Smash Bros.*, politics, music, science, gaming, and so on. But at this point, I'm running on the knowledge I obtained when I actually did things and based on the handful of things I've managed to do beyond my usual bullshit. I also have a lot of desires, like learning Japanese and becoming a musician. The problem is that I can't bring myself to turn these interests or desires into satisfying, lasting hobbies, and frankly, it makes me feel completely broken and useless as a human being.

I'm on medication, but it only serves to ease the sting of the constant feeling that my life fucking sucks, with no culprit but myself. My therapist says I should meet with the people who prescribe my medicine and tell them about this; I guess it's because she has no idea what simple therapy could change about my situation. Whenever I tell my mother that I don't want to do even things that benefit me, she just tells me I have to force myself, but forcing myself makes it less enjoyable for me, and after all, if you have to force yourself to like something, do you really like it?

I just want one, little thing. I want one hobby, one constant activity that I can do every other night that will make me feel like a complete human being rather than a slob at a computer. I want a hobby that will pop into my head during a boring lecture as my plan for the evening. I don't care if it's practicing *Smash* or drawing circles or making stupid videos. I just want **something.**

367,Learning to live without my lifelong depression,"I have had depression and anxiety for most of my life. It had a huge impact on my childhood because I socially isolated myself almost completely, so my social skills have always been a little stunted. Having been that way for most of my life, I grew up thinking that isolation and loneliness was just who I was, the only thing I could be. 

But earlier this year I hit rock bottom and I've been pursuing treatment in earnest, and my quality of life is way up, even considering the little slip-backs I have once in awhile. But one question I've been longing to ask someone else recovering from depression is this: does anyone else feel like they are having to relearn tons of things? Like, how to view other people, and talk to them. I feel like I have so much to catch up on. It feels kinda like a rehabilitative process, except... I don't really know what the end result is supposed to feel like. Can anyone out there offer some solidarity on this feeling? I know I'm on my way to recovery, to something better, I'm just... in an awkward stage at the moment.",1535613067.0
368,Codependency/Being wanted,"The ugliest truth about myself is that I have only ever felt *okay* when I have the mutual attention of someone romantically/physically...and only temporarily--as evidenced by the failing of my previous relationship, due to a feedback loop of backsliding into depressive habits as/because she grew distant.

This has proven to be an issue as an *utterly* average guy aside from being a little bit on the wrong end of the height bell-curve and unable to grow facial hair that doesn't look like I should be kept 300 yards from a school...(so maybe a little below average.)

I liken online dating to loading up the shotgun and taking my self-esteem out behind the woodshed for the Ol' Yeller treatment, but have an equally difficult time in person due to being an awkward anxiety-creature wearing a mansuit. I can be clever, charismatic, and fun once someone gets to know me but someone has to *want* to get to know me and I regularly botch the first **couple** of impressions stuck in the catch 22 that confidence attracts, but mine is tied noose-tight to feeling attractive.

This is all super unhealthy, and I know it stems from not liking 'me,' and I should ""learn to love myself,"" but that seems *so* much more feasible when you can see someone else, with no obligation to do so, does. Especially on the bad days.

I should add: I don't feel *entitled* to another human being and I understand just not being attracted to someone, but it's tough to just not feel bitter sometimes. I don't need people beating down my door but feeling completely invisible, or worse--repulsive, really fucks you up.",1534704673.0
369,"Motivational Monday- If you need medication, take it.","I know this is bound to be controversial. Some people really don't like medication and feel like it has adverse effects on them. 

From my personal experience, medication HAS helped me and it continues to help me. One of the biggest ongoing issues that I've had is the associated stigma in taking a medication for depression. I've gone on and off medication numerous times because I feel like I should be able to handle life without its aid. 

People are concerned that they won't be 'themselves' or that it will dull their personalities. To be fair, medication does change you. But, it varies and sometimes it's just it subtle ways. 

For me, medication takes 'the edge' off of frustrating situations and allows me to more go with the flow. I experience less anxiety overall. When I first started taking them so many years ago; my world changed. It was that drastic. Now, I take a dosage that is comparatively lower and helps me with my day-to-day. 

It's especially annoying when people who haven't experienced depression first-hand tell you just how horrible medication is. My brother has extolled this 'wisdom' to me before. Saying that diet and exercise are enough. Yes, both of those things are good, but it's also pretty ridiculous because I am not in poor health.

So, if you have a medication that helps you, just take it. Most people have no problem taking aspirin for a headache or to alleviate some pain.

373,How do you take responsibility for your life without succumbing to self hatred?,"I have a lot of trouble with the idea of taking responsibility for my own life, because to me, it comes packaged hand in hand with this sort of harsh, survival-of-the-fittest sort of mindset which goes something like this:

*If I truly accept responsibility, then whatever happens to me is my fault. My suffering is all my fault. My feelings don't matter, my pain doesn't matter, I don't have the right to complain or expect fairness, compassion, loyalty, or forgiveness. I deserve whatever happens to me. I just have to suck it up and take whatever scraps I can get, and if I'm not strong/smart/determined enough to get more, it's my fault. If the deck's stacked against me, it's my fault for not working hard enough to overcome it. There are no excuses and there is no relief from the rat race, except death.*

374,How do you explain not doing enough with your life without telling people about your depression?,"I have a part-time job that I actually like, I'm more comfortable talking to people than I've ever been, and I've picked up two hobbies which I'm at least somewhat motivated to keep doing fairly regularly. 

But I don't have aspirations/goals/dreams. I don't have enough motivation to throw myself fully into any particular pursuit, or accelerate my level of progress. I'm not comfortable committing to any direction. I'm not sure what I want. With my anhedonia, I'm not even sure what ""want"" feels like. 

Barring the anhedonia part, this may be normal for younger people, but I'm 30, and the reason I feel this way is that I've spent most of my life with chronic depression and an anxiety disorder. The anxiety disorder went away a couple years ago, but I've only scratched the surface of the long-term scars it's left in my mind, on top of the continuing symptoms of the depression.

So when someone asks about my interests, it's hard to communicate my ambivalence/aimlessness without revealing that it's still a struggle for me to imagine being alive a year from now instead of dead by my own hand, much less imagine myself in a different job or lifestyle or more actively involved in my hobbies.

I had to deal with a conversation like that last night, and while on the surface it was a success-- I was comfortable and ""positive"" and didn't draw a complete blank like I used to-- I came away from the encounter feeling like I may have erred too much in the opposite direction, exaggerating my level of motivation to appear normal. 

My solace is that since this person is one of my mother's friends and not mine, I probably won't have to see him again for a long time, and by then he'll have forgotten my specific wording. But I still feel uncomfortable about possibly being misleading.

I'm still withdrawn enough that I don't have to talk to people very often, but I figure the better I get at dealing with people and expanding my comfort zone, the more I'll have to deal with people asking me about myself, and the more pressure I'll be under to explain taking things ""one day at a time"" without bringing up my mental health issues.

375,My favourite poem about overcoming depression,"“Yesterday, I spent 60 dollars on groceries,took the bus home,carried both bags with two good arms back to my studio apartmentand cooked myself dinner.

You and I may have different definitions of a good day.This week, I paid my rent and my credit card bill,worked 60 hours between my two jobs,only saw the sun on my cigarette breaksand slept like a rock.Flossed in the morning,locked my door,and remembered to buy eggs.

My mother is proud of me.It is not the kind of pride she brags about at the golf course.She doesn’t combat topics like, ”My daughter got into Yale” with, ”Oh yeah, my daughter remembered to buy eggs”But she is proud.See, she remembers what came before this.The weeks where I forgot how to use my muscles,how I would stay as silent as a thick fog for weeks.She thought each phone call from an unknown number was the notice of my suicide.These were the bad days.My life was a gift that I wanted to return.My head was a house of leaking faucets and burnt-out lightbulbs.

Depression, is a good lover.So attentive; has this innate way of making everything about you.And it is easy to forget that your bedroom is not the world,That the dark shadows your pain casts is not mood-lighting.It is easier to stay in this abusive relationship than fix the problems it has created.

Today, I slept in until 10,cleaned every dish I own,fought with the bank,took care of paperwork.You and I might have different definitions of adulthood.I don’t work for salary, I didn’t graduate from college,but I don’t speak for others anymore,and I don’t regret anything I can’t genuinely apologize for.And my mother is proud of me.

I burned down a house of depression,I painted over murals of greyscale,and it was hard to rewrite my life into one I wanted to liveBut today, I want to live.I didn’t salivate over sharp knives,or envy the boy who tossed himself off the Brooklyn bridge.I just cleaned my bathroom,did the laundry,called my brother.

Told him, “it was a good day.”

377,Life Burnout... Depression related or not?,"Hi. I've posted here a couple times over the last 2 years or so. I thank your guys' help and advice.

However, unfortunately in all that time I have only gotten worse. I have been so paralyzed to make any decisions, I forgot how much worse inaction could be. I want to seek therapy but my past experiences with therapists have made me really picky and now I don't know who to look for and what to look for in them.

Anyways, so the title. Over the last 2 years, I have grown to hate literally everything. Everything is a chore and subsequently takes me a day to weeks to months for me to do anything. You could say its procrastination to another level but I think there's definitely a different phrase and distinction.

For example, the part that hurts me the most... is that things I love such as design, music, art, etc... I can't be bothered to do anything. Moreso, even sitting down and just simply entertaining myself with TV / Movies, Games, Books, Videos, anything. I used to so invested in stuff like anime, comics, movies, etc. Now even those I have to literally force myself to do. more importantly I just can't do anything in general other than just staring at youtube videos for the entire day. Even playing games, watching TV / Movies... I can't start, do, or keep doing something.

Now, you might think I could have just simply lost interest. I would think that too, but no. Nothing has replaced these interests and I still get moments of passion to do things but... some part of me just does not allow me to do it or experience any joy or fun from it... which takes me to my next concern... no matter what I do its really hard to receive pleasure from anything.

380,Can someone please help me? I can’t stop ruminating over a mistake I made in class and really need advice,"Last semester of college I had to present on a short story that focuses on the American Dream. It was about an immigrant teenager in America and I had to create questions for the class to answer. In all honesty, I struggled with making the questions—they were way too complex, wordy, and abstract. I’m not the best writer. One of them was so terribly wrong that I feel awful and ashamed of myself. I didn’t mean to word it so terribly. I basically worded the question like, “to what extent is the American Dream achievable?” and referred to the American Dream as “idealized.” One of my classmates posted how wrong it is to describe the American Dream as being real and that I missed the whole point of the story. That the narrator is a struggling immigrant taking care of his mother and doesn’t need to strive for living an “idealized version of life.”

After three months of this occurring, this obsession that I’m an awful, superficial, self-obsessed, human being came out of nowhere. I don’t deserve the privileged life I’m living and my optimistic attitude just shows my lack of logic and intelligence. And I feel like the 20 other classmates saw me as that.The professor even pointed out that 59% of people don’t believe the American Dream is achievable and it shouldn’t be viewed like it exists at all.

I feel so guilty, and didn’t even own up to my mistake as I worried I’d mess up even further. 
How do I end this rumination for good? It came from nowhere after three months and I’m not sure why. I’m so damn tired of thinking about it every five minutes.

A year ago, I was really excited about life. I made straight As at a pretty tough college. I had a position as a researcher, and I was making friends. There was a clear path forward. It seemed I was really going places. 

Ever since then, I've felt like someone threw me in a river with a sack of bricks tied to my ankle. I feel stupider every day. I had my first panic attack in the fall, and I just can't bring myself to do certain things. I don't have the heart to tell anybody, because they all seem to think I'm capable of doing really well at everything. I don't think I'm cut out for college. I get stressed so easily.

My dad was a janitor. I'm not cut out to be a mathematician, or a programmer, or an economist, or any of these crazy things. I'm not stupid, but people seem to confuse that with me being smart. 

I have a research position again this summer and I just don't even know why. We're doing all this crazy stuff with abstract math and category theory and who knows what and even though I understand it well enough to work with it, I don't have any special understanding or anything. It takes me a long time to get these concepts. I think somebody made a mistake or something because I'm really just not intelligent enough to be working on this stuff.

My parents took me to the water park, but all I wanted to do was go around and around on the lazy river on a float for the whole day.  It wasn’t fun or relaxing, it didn’t feel like much, I was just a bit bored. I used to go on the water slides so many times and jump off the diving boards, but now I don’t really want to.
I get to go on a vacation at the end of this year but I’m not excited about it. 
At all. I want to be excited about it, but I’m not.

Every day, I go to school, get back, watch YouTube not because I enjoy it but because it keeps me from being bored, then go to sleep. 

The only part I actually like is hanging out with my friends which is really really really fun. I hang out with them after school about once a month but other than that, my life cycle is wake, school, YouTube, sleep. 

I quit all my hobbies and genuinely don’t feel like doing anything. Nothing is fun and I just want to stay home.

Sometimes I laugh at things, but other than that I am really really really apathetic. 

I’m really sorry if I sound ungrateful here, but is there any way I can stop it?

388,Being open about my depression turned out to be a horrible idea,"I have struggled with depression for a long, LONG time. My sophomore year of high school I told a school counselor I was going to kill myself, and she then contacted my parents (as she had to by law). I had never told them anything about my mental health, and I think they thought I was faking it as they reacted with what seemed like anger. They kept asking why why why I felt this way, and unable to think of many specifics because it was definitely stemming from medical depression, I cited track (which they forced me to run). My dad told me ""we won't be blackmailed"", referring to letting me out of running track, and I was led to apologize for scaring them.

Fast forward to now, I'm a sophomore in college. For the rest of high school, I didn't talk to them about my mental health at all. I got really good at hiding it, and I think they brushed it off as an influence of a bad friend and a fake incident. I was so excited for college because I would finally be able to get a therapist and get on medicine, which I thought would just fix my problems.

Last year (my freshman year) I had big problems with my depression. The transition to college was hard, and then I got on medicine and it severely increased my depression. I had what I would call a severe depressive episode at the end of my second semester, in which I was in bed all day every day, not showering or eating, and I was very suicidal but didn't have the energy to follow through. One of my symptoms is passive/intrusive suicidal thoughts, and they were very amplified. This was the first time that my parents really started to know more about my mental health apart from knowing that I was getting on medicine and going to a therapist.

This summer was great for me, I thought I was recovering from my depression after so many years of it. However this fall it got horrible again. I've been in a depressive episode for about a month now, with ups and downs as it goes. For the first time in my life, I leaned on my parents through it. I talked to them both about applying for an ESA and started reaching out to have lunches/dinners. I called my mom during a panic attack, sobbing to her over the phone. It really made me feel so so much better and I started to feels supported in a way I never have before, so I opened up a lot about how hard of a time I've been having.

Lately I feel so fucking horrible about doing this. My mom has told me several times that she's worried about me and cried with me about it. She has gotten to the point where she's projecting as frustrated/angry with me, even though I know she doesn't want to. She wants to FIX it and keeps suggesting things to me like coming home from college and commuting, telling me I need to go to class. Just like in high school, she keeps asking me for reasons why I'm feeling this way, and while I can pinpoint some things that trigger it, I can't tell her what the hell is the base reason. She's said stuff like ""was there some trauma that happened to you when you were young that you're hiding?"" There's not. I have hidden some things from almost everyone in my life, like the fact that I used to cut myself in eighth grade/freshman year, and the extent of my suicidal thoughts.

In that vein, today I told her over the phone that my suicidal thoughts have been really bad lately, which is the first time I've told her I even have those. She wants me to get a therapist that specifies in CBT, and join a group, and she told me I need to promise her I will never skip class again. Then my dad messaged me and told me him, her and I need to have a family meeting this Saturday to talk about my mental health. I'm so fucking nervous about this. I don't want to have another family meeting like the one I had with them in high school.

At this point I wish I had never told them. I feel super guilty for the effect this had has on my mom and I also feel like she's mad at me for being this way. I don't know how to explain what's going on to them. I know they're going to ask what's causing it, and I don't have an answer. I also know they both think I'm not doing anything to help myself and that I'm just wallowing in it. Please believe me, I want to get better, but I'm living in a college dorm and they don't seem to believe that I want to help myself. I hate that I told them and I would really appreciate advice on how to handle them and the conversation we have coming. I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow so I'm going to ask her about it too.

tldr: I started being more open with my previously non sympathetic family about my mental health and now I feel like it's really backfired on me. Would REALLY appreciate advice on the upcoming conversation with them and how to handle them/their questions in general.",1572418165.0

390,How do I get back my creative motivation?,"I finished an art degree nearly a year ago. While I was doing my degree I struggled with a number of different things. It took me two extra years to do it, and there were times I didn't think I would make it, but with a lot of help and support I eventually managed to claw my way through and graduate with a 2:1.

I'm immensely proud of my achievement, but it completely burned me out. I started my degree as an optimistic, creative, motivated young artist. I finished it as someone who feels either miserable, anxious, or just disinterested if I try to make anything. Art used to be a very important part of who I am, and now I feel like it's an obligation. I used to have constant creative ideas and now I feel like an empty, boring person.

I've tried forcing myself to push past it and make art anyway in the hopes I would just get over my block, and I made some art, but I didn't feel gratified and I felt like I had to force myself to keep going. I've tried taking a long break from thinking about art at all. I've tried going to exhibitions and looking at other artists' work in the hope it would inspire me. I took a commission in the hopes that it might be easier to make art for a specific purpose. I've tried therapy and antidepressants. But nothing I do seems to bring back my desire or motivation to make art, and I feel like I'm incomplete as a person as a result.

I don't know what else I can do. Any advice would be appreciated.",1562424317.0
391,It's been eleven years. Still Struggling.,"This is a long story. I've been looking for the right community to share it with. 

\- - -

I fell in love with her when I was sixteen. I know this is a red flag when it comes to love stories. I was young, she was young. Neither of us knew what kind of person we were going to be. But even now, 19 years later, I can tell you every detail about that moment. The location, the time of day, the smell of young switchgrass in the summer sun. Child or not, it's hard to forget those moments when the earth shakes beneath you. For the rest of the story, I think I'll call her 'Sam'. 

Sam & I started dating three years later. I was entering my first year in college. She was in her second. We were several states away from one another, but there was no question for either of us. The distance was a necessary evil. We wrote letters. Long, beautiful letters. We visited when we could. We loved passionately. We grew closer than either of us could imagine was possible. 

I started saving for a ring. My entire life was wrapped around the singular thought of making this girl my wife. I no longer cared about who I was or what I should become. As long as I had her, life would be complete. We would have kids together. We would grow old together. I believe she felt the same way. We were dedicated, so blindly, to each other and the love that we had created. 

""Now, Always, & Forever."" That's how we ended our letters. We both believed it. I don't doubt that.

Now I'm 22 and Sam is 23. We have been living in the same state, finally, for some time. We're in a field near my house when we look at each other and agree that we both need some space from the relationship to grow into the people that we want to be. I remember feeling so proud of us for making that decision. I remember feeling like an adult in that moment. I was so confident that we would come back to one another. 

Had I known how much regret would spout from that decision, i wouldn't have said a word. 

It wasn't six months passed before I knew how large of a mistake I had made. I tried getting her back. Instead of working on myself (which was the point of our ""break"") I tried to get her back. I tried hard. Three years pass with me trying so hard to get her back. But Sam, bless her soul, stuck to the agreement. We split up so that we might become better versions of ourselves. I was just fine fooling myself into believing I had changed, but I hadn't. This must have been obvious to her. 

Now I'm 25. It's clear to me that she isn't interested in getting back together. She is spending her days getting her nurse practitioner license. I'm spending my days bartending. I am trying my best to respect her decision and her space. I listen to my friends when they tell me it's time to move on. I try to believe that I actually can. 

Now I'm 26, and I get into a serious relationship with a woman who was bound to break my heart. (Let's call her Lucy) Anyone but me could have seen it coming from a mile away, but I was so desperate to free myself from my true love that I ignored all the red flags. I let my heart be broken. I let myself become seriously entangled with an abusive woman. I started to drink, more heavily than before. One night I smoked an entire pack of cigarettes while standing outside Lucy's house watching the silhouettes of her and another man moving behind her curtains. This was probably the worst night of my life. 

Still, I stayed with her. I thought that there might be a chance, if only I could once and for all become the person I was meant to be. I even wrote her an apology letter after catching her cheating. (Does everyone have a real ""what would you change"" time-machine moment? This would be mine).

It was only a matter of time until Lucy found that box, the box of letters between Sam and I. Maybe two hundred letters. Some of the best love letters you will ever read. That's when Lucy decides to leave me. But instead of saying it to my face she decides to sleep with one of my best friends. We had communication issues. But we both were young. I never held it against her the way my friends told me I should. I felt bad for Lucy. I felt bad for me. There didn't seem to be any point in holding a grudge. This wasn't about Lucy, after all. It was about Sam. And Lucy was just a kid herself. She didn't deserve the weight of my baggage. 

After Lucy and I split I started seeing a therapist. I knew that my feelings for Sam were at the heart of my dysfunction. My therapist was saying much of the same things that my friends were ... that I needed to forgive myself. That I needed to move on. I had three or four sessions with this therapist before I couldn't afford it anymore. I am not sure that I would have kept going anyway. At this point my love for Sam was so deep and untouchable that I had lost faith that anyone in the world could understand it. Even if I hadn't spoken to her in years. 

Now I'm 28. I am broken and embarrassed by what Lucy did to me. I wish I could tell you that I shut her out of my life. I wish I could tell you that I told her off and reclaimed my strength. But I didn't. I was a pathetic pile of a man at this point. I tried to get her back once or twice. Today I thank God that she said no. But we have slept together two or three times since, once quite recently, and it only made me feel terrible. 

\- - -

Before I could regain my feet, I am in a new relationship. Let's call her Allison. Allison is an absolute angel. No one has ever taken care of me the way that she did. She did everything she could to pick me up off the ground and get me back into working order. To a certain extent, it worked. I had someone to love. Someone to cook for. Someone to kiss. Someone to accept the considerable amount of love that I had to give. 

Allison taught me how to communicate. She taught be how to reach my inner feelings and bring them forth. She was there for me at all times and I was there for her, and slowly, I was able to rebuild myself. 

But our honesty came with a price. It became obvious to her that I still had these deep feelings for Sam, so many years later. We communicated ourselves right out of a relationship. We decide to split up, in what was the only truly amicable breakup of my life. She wished me luck with my feelings, and promised to be there for me on my journey. To this day she is my best friend, and I am eternally grateful. 

\- - -

Now I'm 31, and I am single for the first time in a while. Allison has moved out. I soon move away, out into the mountains and away from the city where so much heartbreak has happened. I decide that I need a few years to spend on my own, without anyone clouding my own growth and development. I actively avoid women. I have a few one night stands here and there, but they are hardly satisfying. I feel bad for the women when they leave. I wonder what kind of blank stare I have on my face while trying to pretend that I'm interested in them. 

\- - -

Now I'm 33. This is today. I haven't been in a real relationship in almost four years. I thought that this might be enough to reset my emotional state, but I am hardly reset. I wake up every single morning thinking of Sam. I think of what we used to say to one another. The things that I promised her. The life that we wanted to live together. Sunsets always bring me to tears. 

She is married now. I have bumped into her once or twice. I try to hide it, but I imagine she can see how hopelessly in love with her I still am. She can probably see it on my face. It's probably why she refuses to introduce me to her husband. 

At least I am not a drunk texter anymore.  That's a good sign, right? 

\- - -

Look, I get it. I've heard all the advice from all the sources. I know that I'm supposed to move on. Sweet lord, I have tried. I have tried everything. Drinking, smoking, dating, waiting. I am well aware that Sam is not coming back to me. Not ever. Nor would I want her to ... she deserves better than me. She's probably not even the same person that I fell in love with 17 years ago. And she has someone that loves her. Why can't I let go?

\- - - 

There is no better way to say it: I am absolutely obsessed with my breakup with Sam. It has defined me as a person in every way. It has prevented me from becoming who I want to become and doing the things I want to do. It has sabotaged relationships. It has stalled my development. It is a pain that I can't help but cherish, though I try so desperately to forget it all. The whole thing feels like a wrong-turn that I can't take back.

Yet those letters of ours, the ones that end with ""now, always, & forever"", they still sit at the back of my closet. I have actual dreams about setting them on fire. Or burying them in the dirt.  I wake up every day feeling like I am living the wrong version of my life. As if my real life slipped away along with her soft hand so many years ago. 

\- - -

I have moments of peace. I am not a miserable person. I live my life today in a way that I think she would admire ... in a way that my younger self would admire. I accept that I will never have this love in my life again. I am open to falling in love with someone new, though I am terrified that it will be sabotaged from the beginning. Still, I am hopeful. 

It just that one wrong turn ... that singular regret. It haunts me. I wake up in sweating. I wake up in tears. I shake it off and get on with my day. But the shape of her name is forever on my tongue. The depth of her river stone eyes. The purity of her spirit. The way she looked at me with one upturned eyebrow when I said something silly or stupid. 

 Sometimes, I wish she had cheated on me so my heart would have a better reason to forget her. I have even spent time pretending this were so, just to see if it helped. It didn't. 

\- - -

392,I’m so afraid to fall back into unhealthy patterns,"After a few months of being on medication, my mind was finally silent enough to focus on myself. I quit my job, I moved to Hawaii, and just started to genuinely feel things again. To feel the sun, to taste the food, to actually enjoy laying in bed, not because I didn’t want to do anything else, but because in bed is where I was comfortable in that moment. It’s so scary remembering how I used to feel. I felt crazy, I didn’t feel like myself, I didn’t feel like a functioning human being. I’ve made so much progress and I feel like with one switch of a button I could fall back in so deep and it scares me.",1559926010.0
393,"im sick with anxiety- can someone please talk to me, I have no one","Okay so I have no one to talk to about this stuff at all so I'm basically just here for some support. I don't know, I'm just tired of crying to myself- I need someone to vent to even though the situation won't change. I'm just lying here and I feel like im going to throw up with anxiety and I can't move and I want to cry. I have literally no motivation left to move a muscle at all and I guess I just want to see if anyone is out there and cares at all. sorry for the long post in advance.

I am doing so terrible in college due to depression and anxiety That I feel like my life is over. I know it isn’t actually over, but the thing is that it is definitely substantially ruined.

I was taking 4 classes, but I withdrew one so now I have a w on my transcript. Now im failing two classes and I have a C or D in the other one. 

I missed an exam the other week. We only have 4 total exams and I got a 50 on the first one and skipped the second one. so thats a zero on an entire exam. 

I haven’t been to the class since because I am absolutely terrified of facing the professor. terrified. Plus I still don’t know the material which is why I skipped it in the first place. But every time I try to study it I get super anxious thinking about my grade and how difficult it will be to learn all of this information and I can’t focus at all. Even if I learn it now, whats the point? a 0 and a 50 on an exam=failed class.

I emailed the teacher the day after the exam and said I was sick or something and I would redo the exam but she didn’t email back until a week later and just said we needed to talk. I never responded or showed up. She put a 0 in the grade book so its over. 

Failing this class means 0 for my GPA which means ill never get into transfer schools (im at a CC) and especially not grad school. Forget engineering, forget vet school, all my potential career paths can be forgotten about. Realistically im getting 2 Fs and a C this semester. At a Community college. That looks terrible because it is. this is supposed to be easy but I can’t pull myself together to do the simplest things.

I will also lose my spot in the honors program (even if I don’t fail- I need a B plus average to stay) which means lose all the friends I started to make. I will lose my scholarship which gave me free tuititon. My siblings are college age and in the same program and they’ll think I’m stupid and embarrassing for getting kicked out. And lazy. Which I guess I am.  

My dad will kill me. He will hate me. He will be so angry and disappointed and he’ll say it to my face- “what is wrong with you?” It won’t be the first time he’s said this as a result of my failures. Ill be embarrassed every day as I work extra hours to afford school while my siblings go for free. Ill be embarrassed when I don’t get into a 4 year while they go to Rutgers on scholarship. I was supposed to go there too.

What will I do now? Become a garbage collector or something. I was supposed to be smart. Everything is ruined now and theres no going back this time, no second chances. why do I always expect another chance? I've screwed it up! thats it. you absolutely can't do anything you want to do in life. not if you fail. GPA haunts you forever and theres no starting over. I will literally never be a doctor no matter how hard I try. my mistakes are written in stone.

idk what im trying to do here. get sympathy or something? I know I don't deserve it and no one will probably even respond but if you read this sorry for the long post.",1554927911.0
394,Miss Student Life and Cannot Move On,"I graduated in 2015 and right after had a short period where I taught English abroad before quitting. Been unemployed since 2016. 3 years. I have drive, I stay fit, healthy and try to improve myself, I just don't have anything that motivates. Going from student life to the ""real world"" is grim. Nothing about this life appeals to me, and I can't see how I can get the set up I had as a student without being very rich. 

My home is in the city and I went to university for 3 years far away in a very rural area where I got to lived on campus, in a flat with 7 other students. I was in walking distance from all social activities and I really enjoyed going to them. Meeting new people and discovering new interests. And whenever I used the kitchen I always got to have great interractions with my flatmates, it was amazing. I never felt alone, but I could be alone whenever I wanted. 

I had a truely diverse range of friends from the different activity groups I was part of and some people from my course. And those people I befriended were people I felt I had a connection with... there were so many people you get to meet, you have no reason to keep in touch with people you don't get along well with. And it's really easy to get to know people as we all have the same goal at the very least, we're the same age and we know no one is a threat. And on top of that meeting up was never a big deal, I could just call a few friends and within 5 minutes they'd all be at my place and I could cook some pancakes for them, which I actually did. Doing things things that are usually boring like cooking, cleaning, shopping, exercise was always fun when you could do it with a friend. 

I could study/do coursework whenever I wanted. I don't have to go to work for 8 hours + a day and have a boss forcing me to work on something that has no relevance to my life. If I studied it was for my own benefit. 

Living in the UK we're given a grant to cover all our living expenses, we just have to deal with tuition fees for which we take out a loan. So I had free money to buy the food I want and live in an accomodation I like. 

Now having moved back home with family, life has been abysmal. After I left my teaching job and came back home, everything has gone downhill. Life is different in every single way. I live with family who I am constantly fighting with, very toxic environment. Meeting people is hard, it's a long journey to go to social events as opposed to a 3 minute walk, and even when I get there it's not like in university where there are already several established commanlities, people can be 27 or 54 and have widely varying agenda. Life is just a lot more rough in every way. 

Throughout this period I cut off ties with my friends as I was just too embarrased about how I feel and where I'm at in life compared to them. As a student I always appeared as though I really had my shit together and I took pride in my self-image, and the fact that now I have the opposite image, it's too much for me to share.

On top of all this since I have no goal as nothing appeals to me, I have had no enduring motivation to work so I have been unemployed for 3 years. If wellbeing is a measure of the healthiness of your relationships, feeling like you're doing work that doesn't feel like slavery, living in an environment that is inspirational and having general feeling of freedom, then life will always be objectively worse for me unless I suddenly become mega-rich, so what's the point? Fuck it all.

There's nothing that can fill the gap that life as a student left behind. I bet to most people this all sounds pathetic, but I wonder how they'd react if their living standards suddenly fell to rock bottom with no chance of getting it back.",1554827823.0
395,Depression and loneliness from lacking an intimate relationship.,"I've been depressed for several years. Recently, within the last year or so, I realized there is a specific cause to it. I feel very lonely all the time, even though I have lots of great friends. It took me even longer to realize that this is because what I really want is a romantic relationship. I see my friends all the time so it's not just that I dont talk to people because I do. I just really want try having a girlfriend in specific.

I'm almost 19. I've never been on a date. All the friends I have I met through my best friend who I'm super thankful I met because without him I don't think I would know anyone right now. But this also means I never learned how to meet people by myself. I literally have no idea how to meet people on my own. The handful of times I have it's been basically a miracle.

So in addition to being depressed I also get frustrated because I feel incapable of taking significant steps to accomplishing that goal. I'm a simple person. The only thing I want in the whole world is to cuddle with someone. Just being with someone close would be enough for me.

Thankfully it's not like I'm fat or ugly or anything. I take care of myself and I have no problem talking to people, at least when I'm comfortable enough. It's just that I don't do things that would lead to me talking to new people on a regular basis.

I don't want to just wait for something to happen. I've been trying to work out more and do more research into depression and stuff I can do. I've been going out to walk in the park more and going out with friends more. Recently I went with a friend to somewhere pretty far that we've been planning to go to for awhile (If anyone follows fighting games I went to NLBC). It was fun and I feel like old me wouldn't have been confident enough to do it. 

On one hand I appreciate that I know exactly what my problem is and I have the motivation to fix it, but I really need more ways to use that energy. Everyday it causes me emotional pain and anxiety to feel like I could be doing more or that I'm not capable of achieving that dream. I get tired of it hurting all the time, and I think about it every free moment of my day since it causes me constant pain. Anytime I see people together it feels like a knife was jammed into my stomach. It has also caused me to think less of myself since everyone I know seems way more capable than I am at talking to people and getting dates if it comes to that. This has been on my mind for years. 

Maybe I do have to just keep waiting, but if so I wish it didn't have to make me feel so shitty. I really am afraid of being alone for a long time. And I see other people who are a lot like me in terms of interests into nerd shit do way better with their relationships, and one hand it gives me hope, but on the other it makes me keep asking ""So what am I missing?"". There is a sense of magnetism between other people in general that makes me feel like I'm worth less than everyone else because I don't see similar outcomes from my interactions with other people. And I know that's probably just not true, but it doesn't feel like it. Sometimes I don't even feel real myself.

I would appreciate advice but even if there isn't any just writing this out helped me get my thoughts in order, so thank you for reading this far.",1553269291.0

398,I've been cruel to myself,"Hey everyone, so this title was the realization that hit me last night. 

For some background, I've had self-loathing issues since around age 8 and from then, feelings of anxiety and extreme stress, and then the crushing weight of an inferiority complex / depression. 

I never received any help as a kid because my mom would threaten me / curse me out whenever I had meltdowns. Due to that, I just learned to internalize everything and resent the part of my mom that was never emotionally there for me.

This was all well and good until I got into college. I commute to campus and this semester hasn't been great. I've been finding it hard just to go to class because my college as a whole has become this object of hate for me. I truly thought I would be having the time of my life but life has been worse than ever. And it came to this point where I was just convinced that my life was never meant to be good. I was just destined to ""take one for the team"" and be the one to live an empty life. 

I realized I would eventually get to the point where life would be unbearable so I'd live until then, and then just kill myself when I needed to. Yet having this escape plan did nothing to comfort me. 

Because I wanted to live more than anything. The ideal life in my head, obviously, but still. I wanted to be happy but I honestly couldn't see how anything would ever change. I felt like I was going to soon find it unbearable to just be alive.

Then I realized how cruel to myself I'd been. 

This large part of me was always hurting so badly and I never did anything to help it. I just internalized everything and never tried talking to anybody or seeking out help or even attempting to help myself. 

I had gotten angry at this part of myself that was so empty that I couldn't see that it was the part that needed the most love. It was the eight year old me crying in the bathroom because my mom wouldn't acknowledge my emotions. It was the thirteen years old me that bawled in my bedroom because my anxiety would keep me from taking chances and making friends. And it's the twenty year old me that felt like there was a countdown inside me and when it hit zero, I would take my life.

I had been so, so cruel to myself. And I refuse to be a copy of my mother by just telling myself to ignore all the negativity I felt inside. Since I'm still dependent on my parents as a commuter, seeking a therapist and whatnot is probably out of the question. But I know my University has mental health services I could utilize. Though this semester is ending, I know I'll check them out next year and then try to get involved in a club and whatnot.

I'm sorry, me. I won't push you away anymore. Even if I can't ever confide in my parents, I don't want to internalize and deal with everything on my own.

399,Things are turning around,"I don't have anyone to share this with so I'll just put it here. I went from being in a mental hospital, failing all my classes and being very malnourished to being accepted into university today. That was only six months ago I woke up on a cold mattress and coarse sheets and somehow I turned it around. I had my meds readjusted I made myself take them every day I could eat again and then little things seemed to follow like getting together with friends. Granted it doesn't feel like it's over, I don't know if it ever will. I've manifested social anxiety from the whole experience but I work with it every day. And now I get to go to college! I never thought I'd make it to 18 but now I think I'm starting to see a future. I don't think there is such thing as getting over it. Bad days come and go but I do thing that it can be contained and manageable. It took me eight years to finally feel comfortable saying yes I am content with life, but I'm glad that I have that privilege now. It's bs but it is actually true, things eventually get better.

(And other happy things)","Just celebrating a major relief and accomplishment, in an effort to help inspire you all to keep at it/because I'm really excited, but I just landed my first full-time job, with 1.5 months left at school! I'm starting part time on my off days until I graduate. I hope it goes well, and I'm real excited despite it only paying $14/hr (I live in Boston where that doesn't get you a whole lot), but its one less thing to worry about and I'll finally be making some money, which means I'll actually have my own income instead of my parents supporting me, and I can pay off my credit card which is another relief! 

Also, I was recently switched off Effexor (which was exasperating my anxiety/depression) to Zoloft, which has made a huge difference for my mental health.

I of all people know shit sucks sometimes (and sometimes a lot of the time), but its times like this that help me think about the positive too- I stressed and stressed about money and getting a job and with a few months of applying to jobs anywhere I was qualified and showing up to the interview and actually calling them back and trying for this job, I will be so much less stressed in the long run.

It sucks to show up and try, but it will pay off!

I made it two years a go but I still get people commenting and thanking me for helping them. It even inspired a YouTuber to make her own video on her depression and thousands of people watched it. Just by talking about my depression I created a ripple effect, and it helped a lot of people. This is why people need to talk more about mental health and remove it's stigmatism. I know what worked for me won't work for everyone, but as long as it helps some and gives hope to others, then it always be a video I'm proud of. Look after yourselves :)",1476133287.0
402,First I opened my eyes and realized I'm surrounded by friends. Then I could tell my meds work.,"I had been depressed for as long as I could remember. I focused on the times I was alone at home with no one texting me or chatting with me on FB. I took it personal I had to arrange things to do with my old friends. I was still blaming my family for how they behaved while I was a teen or had assumed things about them that weren't true. 


Something changed after getting off the phone with my brother. Here was a person that genuinely loved me, his wife thought of me as a friend, and I was still telling myself I was alone. Then more realizations came flooding in. I've gotten career advice from professors at college, my widowed step-grandmother is the only person who still sends me cards, I am a persons best friend who confides in me, and I have a couple almost a decade old online friendships and one online romance. Most of all, while being depressed focused on being neglected I have been neglecting them. I can't expect people to just suddenly change how they're used to interacting with me. I can't expect them to talk to me first when all I've ever done was get their attention first or I was signed in but away. 

I wanted to also say secondly, I was skeptical anti-depressants worked. I thought talking about my problems was all I needed. Finally I went to a psychiatrist and was honest about my emotions even the ones I thought weren't important. I had addressed my depression a year before with meds but I didn't like the numbness I felt. I was going to suck it up and get back on it anyway to take control of missing work and school. I mentioned something I hadn't before, not only I was to depressed or disinterested, on the days I did make it out the door I'd freeze, my heart pounding, and panic rose up about returning to face the consequences. I learned about anxiety and not only is there medication for it but I could have the same pill for both depression and anxiety. 

I got in the routine of taking my pills even if I didn't think anything was going to happen for at least a couple months. I didn't take notice of the days I made plans and stuck to them. Even when I drove the whole distance to the school without once feeling the urge to turn around and speed back to get in bed. I realized the medication was working for me when I caught myself humming, folding the wash, and actually taking the effort to put it all away. Not a thought in the world other than being productive, doing what I needed to do, and happy for myself. To some people this makes no sense, they don't understand that just maintaining having clean things is a healthy activity. When a mind is only filled with unhealthy negativity and sadness caring about yourself is last. It's a triumph for me and for the first time in a long while I wasn't looking through smog.",1411630969.0

404,The Twelve Step Program for Life by M.K.,"1. There will be some days when you close your eyes while crossing the street, maybe because you want to see what fate has in store for you, or maybe because your depression is running rampant again and you don’t know how to calm her. It’s okay. I will still love you.


2. There will be a year, or a series of years when your birthday doesn’t feel special. Celebrate anyway. Because people spent time baking you a cake and buying you cards and even if they’re your family and they’re obligated to, they still love you. Cherish that love. Revel in it. It is the best gift you will ever receive.


3. You will learn that the saddest word in the English language is stay. Whether it’s your mother’s voice whispering it before you leave for college, or your ex-lover’s desperate screams as you walk out of the house, it will always be a hard word to hear. Sometimes you should listen to it, other times you shouldn’t. Trust yourself. Go with your gut.


4. Along with hearing the word stay, you will also hear the word why from every person who is remotely related to you. Why did you get that tattoo? Why did you try to kill yourself? Why aren’t you married yet? You don’t have to answer them. Be selfish. Keep somethings to yourself.


5. Some nights you won’t be able to sleep. You will lie awake at 2 am and contemplate existentialism and wonder if the French had a point. Get up. Get out of your bed. Do something. Because even if there is no God, what you do matters, who you are matters. You matter to me.


6. Some days you will want to run away and never return. So go. Drive to a small town in the Northwest, maybe Oregon, and settle down there for a while. Tell people your name is Elizabeth, because you loved Jane Austen as a child and because this a town full of strangers and who’s to know the difference? Don’t be selfish. Call your mother each night and remind her that you love her. Come back home when you find yourself seeing your sadness painted in the shadows, and when you feel more at home in the arms of a stranger than on your own.


7. There will be several nights when you lose yourself in the medicine cabinet, because liquor and morphine seem like a faster cure than time. It’s okay. I will still love you in the morning.


8. One day, in the midst of work, you will learn to forgive. It will start out with a simple reminder of the past, maybe a facebook notification from an old schoolmate or a wedding announcement from an ex-lover. In that moment you will learn that yearning for the past isn’t romantic, it’s stupid, and that if Gatsby had just let go of the green light he would’ve lived. So forgive your past, it didn’t know any better, and move on.


9. Leaving home will hurt, but soon you will learn that home isn’t a place but a feeling, and that there is a compass on your heart that points directly to that feeling. Follow that compass. Don’t get sidetracked by boys who don’t care or alcohol that doesn’t forgive. If you follow that compass, no matter how lost you get, you will always have a home.


10. The hardest lesson you will ever learn will be to love yourself. But you can do it. There will always be days when you hate yourself, days when you wish you had never been born. But darling you are beautiful, and if Shakespeare had met you you would’ve inspired his 18th sonnet, and if Monet had known you he would’ve given up painting water lilies and chosen to paint you instead. I know it’s hard to love yourself, but sometimes it’s okay to be a little selfish with your love.


11. When you begin to feel worthless, remember that the stars died for you. You are made of elements that are thousands of years old, elements that make up every atom of your being. When you want to cut your wrists, remember that the souls of stars live in your veins. Don’t kill them. Don’t be selfish.


12. Some days will be beautiful. Live for those days. Live for the days when the sun shines on your soul and the smile on your face isn’t forced. Live for the days when you don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks because your scars are a part of your story and you don’t need someone else’s approval to wear them with pride.
Live for the life you always wanted but were too scared to pursue.
Live for you. Live for me. Live for every person who has ever loved you, for the people who have come before you so that you may be here today.
Live for the fire that burns in your soul, that tells you: keep going, you’re almost there, just a little farther. Because when Rome burned down the emperor didn’t run away, he stayed and he sang for his people. Stay. Sing for your people. Sing for us.
Are you listening? Because this is your life, singing a siren song to capture your attention and steer away from the rocks, to guide you back home.",1382386359.0
405,Keep fighting,"Hey you. Yes, you! You are fucking awesome! Getting over depression/anxiety is difficult. It is a frustratingly slow process at times, but what matters is that each day you get up and take another step on your path towards self healing and recovery. Push through the pain. Take baby steps. They add up. Each day walk a little bit further than the day before. I know that it hurts, but keep pushing yourself forward. You will get better.

Depression consumes your mind, warping your thoughts. It will whisper all manner of horrible things to you. It will make your thoughts run in circles of despair. It will wear down your resolve to live and paint everything good and beautiful in your mind with its dark brush of pain, apathy, and negativity. 

Depression is a fucking liar. It is full of shit. You are not what it tells you you are. Don't believe the lies that depression will tell you. Everyone fucks up and makes mistakes. It doesn't matter that you failed something. What matters is what you do with that failure. Every failure can teach you something, but only if you let it. It starts with changing how you view failure. Imperfection does not equal failure. Failure does not equal personal inadequacy. Failure is a gift. From it, you learn what doesn't work, which puts you one step closer to learning what does work. Take what you've learned from your failure and keep working for what you want. You are the only person keeping score of your life. You have the power to focus your mind on positive or the negative. We all know what depression wants to focus on. What do you want to focus on? When depression whispers sharp daggers into your mind, fight it. Fight it with every ounce of strength you have. It will take all of your strength and then some, but you will discover that you are stronger than depression tells you you are. Keep fighting. When depression knocks you down, pick yourself back up. All that matters is that you keep getting up. Every single day, get up and fight. Keep walking on your path, one foot in front of the other. You can do it. You will get better. It will not be easy, but it will be worth it. ",1364406191.0
406,"r/loseit style r/getting_over_it, with goals, methods, metrics and other tangible tools of improvement","For those who are unfamiliar, loseit is a subreddit about weightloss where people post their goals, progress, current weight, pictures, methods of losing weight etc. As someone tackling with weightloss myself, I find it extremely helpful to interact with others, see their progress, ask questions etc to motivate myself and get myself closer to my goal.

I somehow find this quite similar to the purpose of r/getting_over_it. So my vague proposal would include having some enhancements that would mimic the approach in r/loseit, as much as it'd make sense. Here are some of my initial ideas, please feel free to argue over;

- Metrics; all here would have the main goal of getting rid of depression, akin to being in a target weight. But how are we measuring the weight of our depression? I'd suggest having flairs for those who volunteer that would indicate their current depressiveness according to some rating scale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rating_scales_for_depression). For example ""existee (BDC: 10/25)"" meaning a current score of 10 from Burns Depression Checklist. For reference, indeed Burns suggests filling in BDC and tracking the improvement weekly, with an ultimate target of <5. Possible problems here would be the scales not being in public domain, thus of limited accessibility to a percentage of users. There are some public domain scales, I don't know, this can be ruled out

- Action plan; other thing r/loseit people mention are their means of losing weight. They talk about their diet, their exercise routines, of varying specificity, what worked for them in the past, what didn't and so on. An example would be "" existee: I target for sub-5 score in BDC, and for this I've planned a timeframe of 1 year. I'm eating cipralex (pharmacotherapy), seeing a CBT therapist once a week (psychotherapy), and meanwhile reading selected chapters from Burns ""Feeling Good"", especially on self-esteem (bibliotherapy). ""

- Any other subgoals, exercises. Here things might get quite specific about the nature and cause of the depression, but still they should be common enough to be of use to other people. Example ""existee: Along with all, I go to gym 6 days a week (not only weightloss but also stress relief related), I try to go out/call close friends 2 days a week, and I intend to join a drama club for at least 2 months. I'll be keeping a mood log every day for 2 weeks, for situations where the emotion intensity is over 30%, focusing on the theme of low self-esteem""

- Tough mood log entries. This might be a bit CBT specific, but if you'd feel like you're having hard time tackling some negative automatic thoughts, why not ask for some perspective here? For a quick reference, include the trigger, the emotion and its intensity, then the automatic thoughts going through your mind about the trigger. The identification of thinking errors, and rational response to automatic thoughts is what the community could help for.

So what do you guys would thing about this? This is my personal opinion and I might be wrong of course :)",1325534807.0
407,"Dear r/Getting over it, a little motivational speech that I've been repeating as a mantra whenever I have self-doubts. Chins up, everyone.","Backstory: used to cut, have been in and out of depression for the past 6 years and have been trying hard to get over it. Never remember being HAPPY, other than for fleeting moments when something was funny. 

1) I always visit r/funny. every day. incase anyone else feels like I described above, where you're only happy for moments when you laugh, then make a point to get a daily dose of laughter. It won't fix everything, but it will at least take the edge off of a bad mood.

2) I have dealt with shame and utter embarrassment from my scars, haven't let anyone get close. I found it helped to have something to say planned ahead of time incase people asked: ""oh it's a long story""... but after years of hiding and wanting to be free from it all, I had an experience that changed my mood towards my scars. 

---> during a chemistry lab my first year of college, my lab partner saw my scars as we were examining a reaction in a beaker -- ie my hands were holding the beaker and she got a full view of my wrists. She asked what *""THOSE""* were from.. instead of withdrawing in to myself as usual, without a hesitation this came out of my mouth: ""**Wars fought and battles won**""

Recently had a boyfriend discover my scars and he freaked, thought I was creepy and his reaction, plus our immediate break-up, made me doubt everything. Here's where the mantra comes in. Repeating it every time I ever think bad about myself for my past:

THE MANTRA:
** Scars don't predict were we are going, they only show us where we've been. And by God, if I've been in a hole *THAT* deep, yet clawed my way out with every painful and slow step,then I've got more character, will and determination than I've been giving myself credit for. If I can do that once, I can do it again, and then watch me Goddammit, watch me prove you wrong**

When I finally came to the realization that my scars are leftover warscars, from fighting an inner war within myself, they've slowly been turning into markers of pride rather than of shame. They show that I was once in an awful place and kept fighting anyways, changed things around. In the end, if I don't have myself then I have nothing.

This is what keeps me fighting every time depression tries to hit again. Relapses are likely always going to happen, and after saying the above outloud and really thinking on it, I'm ready to fight back every time.

Keep your chins up r/getting over it; we've all got it in us to keep fighting.

408,Lifelong Cyclical Depression: How I'm Learning to Live,"tldr; On and off severe depression my whole life, when it's bad you just gotta keep taking a step forward and you'll get out of it eventually.

I'm 30 now, and will be going back on meds tomorrow and meeting with my therapist the next day.  It's all too familiar, random despair, suicidal thoughts, only desiring sleep or activities to make the day go by quickly.  No desire for love, food, joy, or socializing.  Dead sex drive.  I've been through this all before, more than a few times. 

The sensations are so cliche it's ridiculous.   If I give my internal monologue a second to think it sabotages me and takes me in a spiral down that's a bitch to get out of.  So I don't let it.  I tell my friends, and I tell my family, and I do whatever I can to keep myself in check.  It's the hardest thing I've done, and will keep doing, for the rest of my life. 

So I just keep taking a step forward.  I take time for myself, I relearn to love myself, I try to forgive myself for any stupid things I've done.  I logically know I'll get out of this, even if emotionally it doesn't make any sense.  It helps to know I've gotten through this in the past, and that I'm slowly learning skills to help me grow in the future.  

I think it's healthy, when you get beat down, to be shocked that you've forgotten what it's like to have the wind knocked out of you.  It happens to all of us.  Just because we're not doing well now, doesn't mean we can't be doing well in the future.

I have an affinity for any substance I can get my hands on. No therapy or medication has helped, and there’s been a lot of that. I slit my wrists pretty deep a year ago half in an attempt to die and half to show my parents how bad I felt as they didn’t really take me seriously. All that did was leave me with stupid scars and get me sent to treatment for 3 months, which did nothing but make me feel like more of a dysfunctional loser. My parents are disappointed and ashamed of me. In the span of four years I went from their perfect academic achiever son to a near dropout with substance abuse issues.

I tried a few therapists. 2 told me I needed to find religion, another told me I needed to decide what my purpose was. And I get those statements, even if the religious ones were... not tactful.

415,I just want to be loved and accepted for who I am,"  Tl;dr: My family is never not indifferent towards me and I'm forever starved of love and affection.  


At this point in time , I never felt so unloved. I'm sure many people could relate to what I'm trying to articulate. I only wish someone, either a friend or a family member, would display some form of affection towards me.  


I've always been an introverted kid. When at family gatherings, I always tried to steer clear of conversations the adults in my family had and was always found in someplace quiet, all on my own.  
So I was labeled as the shy kid, and while that was a cute trait I had when I was younger, now it became something that my relatives despised me for. For them it seems like I hate them so they would much rather not talk to me.  
Even in my close family, I never felt validated.  
I had to be psychologically enmeshed with my parents in order to gain an ounce of their love. As a child I was abused both emotionally and physically for setting boundaries for myself.  


My father used to have anger issues. The type to slam objects and yell profanities over the stupidest things. Even though he's now a lot more calm and collected as he got older, I never got to create that healthy father-daughter emotional bond because I was always terrified of upsetting him. He was basically the embodiment of toxic masculinity.  


I had a busy mom growing up. She always left too early for work and went back home pretty late at night. I remember being raised by many women (nannies/housekeepers), most of them were really sweet, but I honestly would've wished to spend my childhood with my mother rather than with strangers.  


My family has always been stoic and emotionally distant. Even after someone's been gone for a while, we've always kept from showering each other with hugs. When going through a rough time, you're expected to just suck it up and handle it on your own.  
Most recently, I got into the habit of self-harm. I still had scars or my upper arm. I've been asked to open up about it, forcibly by my sister, threatening that she would tell my parents, since she didn't want them to think she was the one who caused me to self-harm in the first place.  
My other sibling noticed them as well and decided to keep making fun of me by calling me a drug addict. I obviously told him a myriad of times not to say that anymore and he kept doing it anyways.  


For various reasons, I can't get into a relationship. I'm basically not allowed to date or even think about dating, but I don't want to discuss it in this post or else it would be longer than it already is. I talked about this issue once and reading back, my post was full of gibberish.  


I feel like I've never felt loved by anyone except my grandfather who died 10 years ago. I could never forget how he would embrace me whenever I went to see him. He was my favorite person in the world.  
I can't believe that as socially driven species even touch and affection are too much to ask for. I miss a simple hug and a forehead kiss from someone that I love.  


I know this feels like reading from a 12 year old girl's diary, but please refrain from making snarky remarks because I already feel so much shame for complaining about this sort of stuff. I'm just glad to find a healthy way to cope.",1622909793.0

Turns out, my lack of stamina, how unflexible and stiff and rigid my bottom heavy body is as well as terrible posture from living a very long life of beind sedentary by working from home to pay an ever growing possibly now $130K.. point is, my limitations leave me unmotivated and gave ip on those quick.

But.. theres hope..

I picked up on walking. Now im trying to put a bit of jogging in to try and improve my gealth. Slowly, i hope to get somewhere.

Me and my mom are trying to eat healthier after our entire lives of m.j ot knowing how to. This is a challenge for the both of us since were3use to just eating alot of fried foods, hut we think of our weight and her diabetes, and now a new bone growing in her shoulder.

I would love to be able to jump out in keeping up with pilates, doing these wild calisthenics workouts, but where i am at right now, i meed to focus on the basics: walking, running, stretching, posture, eating, and breathing.

Hopefully,  we can be alright.. while fighting my sister who already exercises to stop buying unhealthy food whenever she comes over.",1610482898.0
417,If you've tried meditation and felt like giving up because you keep having thoughts - it's normal. Give yourself a chance: be still and observe the thoughts as they arise without being swept away,"If you’ve tried meditation a few times then you might have become frustrated. You’re sitting quietly, enjoying the silence, enjoying the stillness and a thought about work pops up, or you remember a difficult conversation you had. You might feel like you’re somehow doing it wrong or you can’t do meditation. 

It’s important to know that this is normal; noone can meditate without having thoughts. Your mind is constantly looking for things to resolve, it’s a problem-solving tool which has evolved to be on the constant lookout for danger, learn from mistakes and its very good at what it does. The challenge comes when the mind is overstimulated, over-active and is constantly processing potential dangers and trying to learn from things in the past. That fragmentation of our attention creates suffering and it’s not until we stop for moment that we realise how busy our minds actually are.

And thats the first step - to simply observe the mind. Notice the thoughts as they arrive, not judging them, not being carried away by them, just noticing what arises. You might imagine yourself sitting on a hill, seeing each thought as a cloud passing overhead and passing over the horizon. Another way to visualise it is sitting by a river and watching leaves float past. Just as we don’t try to stop or hold onto clouds as float past, we allow our thoughts to enter our awareness and then pass through.

So if you find that you’re having a lot of thoughts while meditating and you have to bring your attention back to your breath often that doesn’t mean that you’re doing it wrong - that’s the practice. Over time, training your awareness, you tend to find the thoughts come less often, they’re less intense and they cause less suffering. You spend more time in the present moment and feel calmer and more relaxed.

418,How to deal with obsessive thoughts causing depression?,"Normally, I obsess a lot to the point of anxiety, but now it seems those same thoughts that used to give me anxiety now mostly just give me what seems to be mild depression. It's really weird. Just as an example, let's say I'm a germaphobe. Before, I would touch a surface and feel compelled to clean my hands because of anxiety. Now, I still feel compelled, but my reaction now is to just be depressed.",1605906860.0
419,I going to get fired,"I am not diagnosed for ADHD, because I have not seen a mental health specialist for it. As a matter of fact, last time I went to one (for depression and anxiety) the last thing they mentioned to me was that they wanted to do some testing for me to see if I have ADHD. I never went back after that visit, due to financial reasons.

Anyways, fast forward to now, where I have had a job for the past 4 months (started 1 week before mandatory quarantine). I get so distracted, and some days can’t even focus on my tasks at all. It’s a developing job that requires I focus on a computer screen for 8+ hours a day, and I feel so... hopeless. I’m with a great company, a dream company of mine, but I can’t seem to do my work and I feel like pulling out my hair.

Just today, I went out on a “break” that lasted for 3 hours longer than it should have. My boss texted me, and even now I’m too anxious to respond. I am such a failure, and I am going to get fired from one of the best companies I could have ever worked for.

Update: I had a 1-on-1 meeting with my boss, where I brought up my issue with focus and feeling constantly distracted. He was fairly understanding about it all, although it was clear that he wished I could be more communicative (I struggle with being able to communicate well when I feel inadequate, as I’d rather hide away and work on whatever task I’m doing until completion without having others see me struggle). He seemed to understand where I was coming from though, and essentially told me that it’s okay for me to feel the way I do, and that he wouldn’t hold it against me. I did not mention ADHD, because naming it when I’m not diagnosed is scary and (possibly) inaccurate. I also didn’t really get into my anxiety, because I was afraid.",1595359249.0
420,I Offer You a Success Story,"I'm in my mid 30's. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when I was 21. I have a past filled with physical and emotional trauma. I tried to kill myself numerous times and wound up in the psych ward on 3 separate occasions between 21 and 26 for various attempts at suicide. I've been locked in a cell because I was deemed a danger to myself and  others. I've struggled with drug addiction. Pretty much boiler plate shit for what a lot of us are dealing with.

When I was 26, I chose to check myself into the psych ward for the 3rd time. That was partly informed by the memory, still seared in my mind, of my whole immediate family standing around my hospital bed after I had  almost died of a suicide attempt, bereft of words, wondering why. That experience taught me just how much power I have to devastate the people  that care about me. I understand that many of you don't have those  people and I'm grateful those anchors existed, as light and fragile as  they were. Salient in that moment was the idea that my life doesn't just  belong to me. Even after that experience though, I kept drifting around for awhile, homeless, selling shit to cop drugs to cope with the new reality that suicide was no longer an option. Weirdly, when it felt like a viable option in my mind, I felt like I possessed some ultimate form  of self-determination. I no longer had that thing to hold onto, so everything about my existence felt out of control. I had eviscerated all of my personal relationships by that time and my existence rose little further than basic survival.

I checked myself into a psych ward for the 3rd time because my experience in that hospital room haunted me and I felt my only choice was to start living my life again. Eight days later I was out and I had been prescribed a med that I thought worked. At least it helped me cut back on cigarettes and that small step alone helped build some momentum toward progress. Unfortunately, the struggle persisted for years, into and out of suicidality, on and off using, in and out of different living  situations. I had at least made enough changes to convince someone to let me live with them while I found a job, which I did. Then I finished my undergraduate degree. Then I started really running again. Then I went to grad school and got a masters degree with a 3.95 GPA. In spite of the additional student loan debt, achieving those things felt good. They were huge boosts to my self esteem and mental health, but ultimately none of it mattered. I still felt existence was pain, I hated my life and I wanted to die.

I had known for a long time that if I was ever going to achieve something approximating mental stability, I was going to have to do work on a regular basis that felt meaningful to me in some way, so I became a teacher. People had been telling me for years that I would be good at it, but I knew it was a really hard profession, resisted for awhile and eventually relented. I got my M.A.T. in 2016 and started working as a full-time middle school teacher. Despite acknowledging the meaningful nature of the work I was doing, nothing seemed to pull me up in any significant way from a constant state of anhedonia, at a minimum,  oscillating to and from severe depression.

So I resolved to accept that my life was what it was. I had built up a pretty substantial cognitive tool box, out of pure necessity to help me cope with and survive the most difficult periods. I had accepted that happiness is simply not an emotional state that I get to experience. I had accepted that my life would continue to be a protracted series of battles between my conscious self and my brain chemistry and that sucked, but that was fine. I was fine. I head learned how to win those battles most of the time and I could deal with that. I had developed mental strength and resilience. I had an opportunity to do good in this world. In the grand scheme, I knew I was extremely lucky, despite never actually feeling that way.

Then something unexpected happened.

When I moved closer to work, I had to get a new primary care doctor. I did a google search for doctors in the area, chose a highly rated practice  and contacted them to make an appointment. My new doctor was awesome and  when we got my blood work back, he said that everything looked good, I  was quite physically healthy. He then said, ""all we need to do now is get you mentally healthy."" A friend of his ran a psych practice not far from me and he seriously encouraged me to go talk to them. I told him my hesitation stemmed from only recently having found a place of relative stability and not wanting to upset that in any way. Exercise is the most effective anti-depressant I've ever experienced and I had achieved a decent fitness level that was totally keeping me afloat at that point, I didn't want to rock that boat. He was totally empathetic, though he felt the conversation was worth having.

I found the very worst part of being treated for depression was putting my body through iterations of trying different psych meds, only to wean off and try something else when the first, second and third tries proved ineffective. After about 10 years of trying and wreaking havoc on my body  through each iteration (it takes most people far less time), I was convinced psych meds were little more than a key to unlock one's  capacity to do the work to get better. That's all I had ever done. I thought they were minimally helpful, but at least a springboard to progress. Granted, that was and is still highly significant, but I was disillusioned by the whole concept and frankly a little resentful by  then for even having to take meds. Fortunately, my new doctor had  established enough of a rapport with me that I accepted having a conversation with his friend. The psych said I could stay on the med that I had found minimally effective, while trying additional meds that weren't contraindicated, which is what convinced me to try. They prescribed me a new med. I started taking it.

It was about 10 days later when I started noticing unusual things happening in my brain. I would catch myself reacting differently to various events. I would find myself thinking differently about elements of my life. I would find myself taking more joy in the same shit I had been doing all along. I got my runners high back. I could finally, for the first time in my life, really sit back and look at the things I had  achieved and appreciate how hard I had worked to get there. It was so obvious that it was working I hardly knew how to react. I stood in my kitchen one day crying because it hit me that it was (is) real... at first I couldn't believe it. I thought it could only be temporary, that it would subside with time. For a few minutes I even questioned my whole reality. I felt like I was cheating. Then I realized the only thing happening was I was seizing control of my mind. Practically overnight, all those tools in my cognitive toolbox became 100 times more effective and 100 times less necessary. The best way I can describe it is to say my emotional self-regulation and impulse control (so like most of what governs behavior) were dramatically improved. It took me awhile to learn how to wield that new power, but it was a very fun exploration process.

Now the work is exercising and eating well. That's all I have to do is live a healthy lifestyle. It's just my experience, but I found that the act of doing the work is the very thing that made me and still makes me feel better. It's also very likely what has made me a good teacher. Sure, it will feel like work, but I get no greater sense of accomplishment than when I manifest appreciable progress toward getting my psycho-emotional shit under control. There are moments and situations now that I can fully acknowledge I would have handled very differently in the past, and it makes me smile still every time I have that realization. I've managed to achieve some pretty cool stuff in my life, but nothing compares to the sense of accomplishment in knowing my own hard work has quite literally improved the quality of my internal life. It just took a little pill to allow me to see that. I would have bet my entire net worth that I wouldn't have ever found a more effective med than what I was on. Your miracle could be right around the corner and that's why I want you to keep fighting.

My journey has taught me that when all feels lost, there is still hope. I've learned the benefits of taking control of your mental health will always far outweigh the pain and difficulty you'll have to go through to get to where you want to be. It will always be worth it. The tears won't hurt as much as you think they will. Facing down depression is scary and it takes courage, but you have that courage within yourself already. Maybe you don't need meds, maybe you just need to do the work to change destructive behavioral  patterns, I don't know. I know people reading this come from myriad different backgrounds with infinitely different lived experiences and it might not be very relatable to all, especially those who lack access to, or can't afford mental healthcare. I acknowledge that my innate and societal privileges have put me in a greater position to tackle this shit than a lot of others. So if you take anything away from this, let it be the one thing I can say with complete confidence: the work to get better is worth it. If you believe and internalize nothing else about your behavioral/mental health, internalize the idea that the work will always be worth it!

Thanks for reading and I wish you the best on your journey.

421,I still can't get over my ex even after she's moved on,"My ex and I dated for about 9 months and it was one of my first real relationships. She was the light of my life and really helped me cope with my depression. Then around April we started falling out, then April 30th we broke up, and i was crushed. She told me that she was becoming emotionally dead and needed her own space. Hearing this I thought it was for the best to breakup in the hopes of getting back together even stronger. Then about 4 weeks later a friend of hers told me that she really left me because she was not over her ex boyfriend from a year ago. I felt destroyed that the person I loved the most lied to me and felt that lying to me wouldn't hurt me as much as telling me the truth. I confronted her and she came clean. We cut contact for a while and turns out she has already started talking to someone a few days ago and I couldn't take it anymore. I feel like I was used and I still love her and don't want to let go because I am afraid if she falls again I won't be there to help her again. I just recently started therapy as a coping mechanism but I just don't know if I am strong enough to let go and move on. I haven't been able to experience true happiness since then as well which also doesn't help.",1591983636.0
422,There is NO purpose in life - life is just something weird what happened to us,"Just  turned 25 years old, have great mom and dad, cool friends, sitting in  garden, being a lawyer, knowing 3 world languages, dating cool girl,  drinking beer and realizing, that I am totally sad and broken. Nothing  makes me happy and I am so angry with me - what a wonderful life I have  and I am feeling like total shit.

I´ve  spent one last year thinking about evrrything again and again. Why are  we here? Why am I doing what am I doing? Does that make any sense? What  if I die in the next second - everything I had to deal with, everything  I´ve learnt - done, away. Why should I deal with tragedies, like when  your family member/friend die? He was there in this one particular  moment and the next moment - gone - all is so relative. Your  girlfriend/boyfriend is with you - the next day she/he broke up with  you, how can you manage to keep her/him, he/she can meet someone, have  chemistry - gone, everything gone. You learn, you invest, performing  great in a job - Coronavirus comes, economic crisis - done. Everything  you put effort in, lost. What if you have children and they are not  going to be happy as well? What if they would be ill?

We  are all slaves of our brain chemistry. Why I´m feeling good right now?  What tells my brain that I am feeling good? I can´t force my brain to  feel good. What is love? It is chemical process ... one day you are  crazy in love with a person, the next day you don´t even care. All is a  LIE, outcome of a chemical process and nature.

So,  why should I live, when there are so many things, that could happen and  destroy everything... everything. Doing anything is illusion. Why you  want to accumulate resources? Because you need food and shelter. Why you  want to have sex? Because human race wants to survive - you have to  reproduce.

**Nothing  just makes sense - it is totally pointless, worthless. Sooner or later,  you are going to die anyway. So, why the f are we doing this whole  thing? Why we suffer, why are we sad and broken? Nonsense.**",1587745871.0
423,Feeling very dependent on weed. Feel trapped.,"Before I begin, i'd like to just ask for non-patronizing, non-reductive kind words. I know I have a problem. I am aware. Also, apologies if this is long, or if I go in different directions randomly, just need to get it out.

For a little backstory, im a guy in my 30's in Canada. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Depression manifests itself as me being numb, unable to enjoy anything, nothing brings me joy, my hobbies are boring, and everything I can do to occupy my time, just dont bring pleasure. You know that feeling where you're just bored and restless and need something to do, but there isn't anything to do? Thats me, all the time. And my anxiety manifests itself in getting incredibly anxious if I can't escape my surroundings, or a person. I also get very anxious with change. I like my routines. If things are different, i'll feel different, and when I feel like this, thats when the anxiety gets escalated. I also deal with little episodes of panic disorder. Thats when the anxiety from feeling trapped, tips over into a full blown panic attack. Those dont happen very often, but twice in my life, in the past 2 years, its gotten so bad, and lasted so long, that I found myself at the ER of both a general hospital, and a psych hospital. First time it happened, it lasted about 2 or 3 months, and only went away because I started 10mg Cipralex. I stabilized, and was able to continue with my life. I continued to see my therapist. 

2 years later, November of 2019, I started noticing a gradual decline in both my mental and physical health. It got really bad. Probably the worst it's ever been. I was unable to eat much of anything for about 3 weeks. Like, I would see food on TV and feel physically ill. Thinking of food made me nauseous. I am already quite skinny, but I would go to work, my work pants were too loose to fit, people told me I looked terrible. It was the most scared ive ever been. I wound up at the psych hospital after breaking down in front of my therapist. He gave me a prescription for Wellbutrin, and sent me on my way. Now, prior to my first episode, I started using cannabis to boost my libido and my appetite. I also found that it helped me just simply enjoy my evening. I would occasionally get anxious while stoned, but it usually calmed down. November of 2017, I smoked, and felt anxious. I tried telling myself that it was just the drug, but the anxiety just spiraled out of control. I was a mess. I felt panicky, felt super uneasy in my own skin. I also had a morning or 2 where I just felt...off. Its very hard to describe. I felt like I was in a haze, things didnt feel real. Kinda like I was inside my own head, observing the world from the inside, if that makes any sense. I ended up getting put on the escitalopram, which helped. As I stated above, it lasted about 2 years. I started noticing that it started getting harder to reach orgasm. Then my erections started getting weaker. Then my orgasms began losing strength. I'm sorry if this might be tmi, but I used to be able to ejaculate over my head most times lol. Now, I barely ejaculate anything. I kept smoking, because, well, at least I was able to enjoy music and life again. So in the fall of 2019, I went to my doctor about it, and she thinks it's most likely the Cipralex, mixed with some depression, so she thought it was wise to introduce the Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin can help ease sexual dysfunction caused by some anti depressants. About a week later is when the second wave of anxiety hit, and I found myself in the psych emergency, where the emergency psychiatrist prescribed me Wellbutrin too. So I started taking that, my anxiety evened out, and I hoped that the Wellbutrin would give me at least my sex life back. It's been 4 months and it's still bad. I have to up my dosage of Wellbutrin, but then the pandemic hit, and I dont want to play around with psych meds during a time where I dont have access to all the help i'd need if the added dosage of Wellbutrin was increased. Obviously, I know that it wont necessarily affect me in that way, but it's risky. 

Anyways, this is getting long, sorry. So now, I feel dependent on weed. I know I have a problem, because now, I feel like I need weed to be able to enjoy my life. For those who don't know, regular consumption of weed builds up a tolerance to it, and since I smoke every night, my tolerance is sky high. I used to take a small amount and it was plenty, but just last night, I had to smoke 2 bowls to get high. You can stop using cannabis for a few weeks, and your tolerance 'resets'. So this morning, I told myself that i'd start tonight, and forego smoking weed. But now, im sitting in bed, bored out of my skull, and seriously considering sparking up a bowl. I look at the remainder of my time awake, and it makes me anxious, because I have nothing to do, and anything that I do, just doesn't bring pleasure. It's hard to describe. You know when you were younger, and when you were bored, your parents would list off things for you to do, but everything they would suggest, you'd decline. Thats me. I have nothing to do, I can't think of anything to do, and the things I can think of, just don't offer up any excitement or pleasure. Reading is boring. It's too cold out to go outside. The gyms are closed. I don't like cooking because I dont have much of an appetite. 

Ugh, I feel trapped. I feel like I have to choose between being unhealthily dependent on weed, but able to enjoy things again, or not be dependent on weed, but be a shell of a human. I'm thinking of just smoking tonight, and waiting until this pandemic is more under control. Ugh. I hate my life.",1587520746.0
424,I feel lonely during this situation and my head is starting to get clouded with negative thoughts.,"We're stuck at home now. We have been for the past 3 weeks, and we will until at least the end of May. Immediately after that, my finals start, which means that I'll go another 6 weeks without contact, until the end of June. I feel lonely and empty, and honestly, I don't know who to turn to to combat my dark thoughts and feelings.

I have been battling depression and PMDD for years now, and although I've had therapy, it only seemed to work when I could be social. After three weeks of being forced to stay alone with my thoughts, I have had more depressed episodes than ever. It seems like I can't find a way out of it and I honestly don't know how I'll be able to continue this until the end of June. My confidence had soared the last two months, I felt so comfortable in my own skin... I honestly loved it, but it's all gone now.

First of all: I have a boyfriend, but due to this we're unable to see each other for the next three months. It's a recent relationship and I just hope we'll click just as well as before when this is over, I would hate to see him leave because of this. With therapy, I learned how to handle being on my own and how to feel comfortable with rejection and such, but it just still hurts. I may sound calm, but I'm mortified honestly. I don't want to be left just like that again. He knows I have had therapy after my abusive ex and he has no issues with it, and I actively avoid talking to him about my dark thoughts when I have an episode because I'm scared I'll push him away from me. Only when it really overwhelms me, I tell him because I know it would otherwise seem like my life only consists of mysery (and it doesn't).

Second of all: my abusive ex has contacted me again. After a year of manipulation, abuse of power and emotional abuse, I broke up with him and went NC. After that, he has repeatedly tried to contact me again, going as far as having his friends (whom I never met) calling me to explain why I needed to ""grow up"" and ""be mature"" and ""give him another chance"", telling me he was ""heartbroken and extremely down"" and that I ""should pick him up again"". Hell no. Three months after the break-up, he got in a relationship with his first Tinder-date, and a month after that they started living together.

That hurt. I felt extremely replaceable (I mean, three months? After being ""heartbroken and extremely down""? Really?). It didn't help that he made a fake account and spammed me with pictures of his new plaything in bikinis and such, knowing all too well that I have body issues, and telling me how great the sex was and how hot she is and how great living together with her is (which he never wanted to do with me). I felt down, and replaceable, and my confidence was just... non-existent. I picked myself up eventually, but he just continued doing that. It seems like he is extremely happy. My only hope, that it was a rebound, is destroyed as they are together for 9 months today.

It seems unfair. He's living with his ""soulmate"" with whom he has great sex, a cat, and absolutely no issues (unlike with me). Meanwhile, I have had therapy to get over all my issues with my body and confidence, multiple breakdowns, relapses, finally getting my shit together two months ago, a recent boyfriend ( a great guy) who I won't see until the end of June... It just seems so unfair that I have struggled so much to get where I am now, and that I still get all the misfortune thrown in my way, and that I still feel easily replaceable. Meanwhile, my abuser has the time of his life, no problems whatsoever, and all the luck of the world. What the hell? 

I'm just wondering when it'll be my time for luck. 10 years of bullying with multiple broken bones, loneliness, destroyed confidence, an abusive relationship, depression and therapy... That was my life so far. Time for me to get my luck.

I'm sorry for this rant. I have been feeling low for the past two weeks, and I just felt like all this needed to be said. I'm fine if this gets buried deep in Reddit, I just needed to vent about my abusive ex and his tremendous luck, and my fear of losing my relationship. Thank you for listening so far.

TLDR: feeling lonely, abusive ex contacted me to make me relapse (and it worked), fear for my current relationship, don't know how to cope with feeling inadequate for the next three months. Abusive ex also crushed my confidence completely once again.",1585221656.0
425,Does anyone else here feel as if they've already wasted their second chance at life?,"Now before anyone says anything, yes I know I need help and yes I did do these things. You have every right criticise me so you can go ahead and label me as whatever you want. I deserve it.

During my time in primary school, I was diagnosed with ADHD and Depression so I was bullied a lot because of it. Nobody wanted to sit next me and for quite obvious reasons, they really feared me. Sometime later, my family at home started falling apart. Mum and Dad threw plates at each other, police were almost always involved, and I was often in the corner of my room barricading myself from all of the devastation. They later split up and our overall welfare had depleted almost immediately.

(Just to clarify, my father isn't a completely bad person whatsoever, he's just no used to spending time with people as he works transporting goods across all of Australia for weeks at a time.)

Years later, I met this beautiful young lady with blonde hair, a stunning smile, and the most gorgeous eyes I've ever seen. Her name was Talyssa. She sat next to me both in class and at lunch when I was in need of company the most. I'd follow her around and even participate in things like her choir and dance groups though I sucked at both singing and dancing. Bottom line is, I've never felt happier with anyone by my side but her. Not even my mother or younger brother. I may have made a few friends too but the connection I had with them were no where near as exciting. She simply made my blood rush faster than ever before. Sadly, this companionship we had came to a quick end months later.

Just because of some issues I had experienced at home, I couldn't control my emotions anymore. Talyssa happened to be around me at the wrong time almost every single day. I started swearing at her, kicking dirt in her face, pulling her hair, threatening her. Yeah I deserve to be burned at the stake for this and if she were to be the one to light the fire, I'd be more than happy to let her do so. She should have every right to kill me after that and because of the extreme guilt, depression and anxiety I now feel, I no longer have the guts to defend myself anymore. Not even in the most dangerous of situations just because I'm afraid that I'll see her before my very eyes. If I could go back in time and start over just to right my wrongs, I absolutely would. Now I'm broken beat and scarred after overcoming a medication and cigarette addiction due to the intense bullying and uncontrollable fear I have experienced in the worst place in Queensland (Ipswich). I've also experienced this in other places such as Banyo as well. I've felt nothing but extreme guilt, hurt, and loneliness ever since. I'm not suicidal anymore, just really hurt as I'm unsure whether she'd ever forgive or not since it happened over a decade ago. Even if she did, a simple ""it's okay"" wouldn't be enough to justify what I've done. Something about me needs to change.",1582130204.0
426,"How daddy issues massively affect, well... everything(?)","Hello there.
Nowadays, I see a lot of young people (especially women) having those so called daddy or mommy issues (depending on which parent did you dirty). It is this 'cool' and 'kinky' thing, it seems like it's being glorified and I can't stand it. I'm not talking about ageplay or age regression, since those are fine but sometimes the reasoning behind those preferences is way darker and sadder. In my case, my father has been neglecting me since I can remember. Parents got divorced when I was very little and I moved out with my mom. I barely see him, barely talk to him. His carelessness kills me inside, especially when I think of the past, because it was always the case and always will be... The fact that this feeling is familiar and normal to me, makes me such a self-destructive person. I only recently realized that I look for male attention to 'fill the hole', I get attached as soon as I find out the guy I am talking to is nice. I am DESPERATE for their attention and validation, I want to be seen and noticed. And here comes the worst part, as soon as the guy becomes a little distant, consciously or not, I completely lose it and become more attached. Why? Because my psychological itch has been scratched, I needed that feeling of familiarity and in my case, being neglected. So when they give me even the slightest form of attention again, I feel such a rush, I am the happiest person on earth. It truly does feel like I am high on drugs. But also I noticed how my behavior shifts as soon as I have a person like that. I am a lot happier, more productive, I research my hobbies, I work out. I feel like a flower that has bloomed. Don't get me wrong, I never think ""I am doing this for him"", it's just that my whole lifestyle changes. I am 20 now (F) and this needs to stop, truly.

428,I'm so tired of fighting for nothing.,"This might be more of a vent, but I need to just release some stuff.

I'm so tired of my life, tbh. I've been so fucking mentally and physically unwell so much of my adult life, that im beginning to see the big picture. This is my life. My life is being anxious over nothing. My life is being anxious when i'm sick. My life is being anxious when im home all day. My life is being anxious in certain lighting, my life is being anxious around certain neighbourhoods and not knowing why. My life is being so confused and foggy that I can't even tell you about whats going wrong. My life is not eating because food all of a sudden makes me nauseous. My life is having absolutely no libido. My life is me being anxious with dating and new friendships because im nervous about being rejected for being too unwell. My life is about being lonely because of said nervousness. My life is about being depressed as fuck because I have no hope for the future if this is how my life will go, but also unable to cry and release some tension. My life is about phobias over so many things. My life is being so skinny that people comment on how unwell I look. My life is about always being either hot or cold. My life is about being too anxious and depressed to live on my own, hence being dependent on living with my mom at age 31. My life is about being dependent on cannabis to maintain a semblance of an appetite and libido. My life is about people giving me stern lectures about using drugs to cope. My life is being too tired to even get out of bed.

I'm so tired of this. Life so far hasn't been all that great. No matter how far I get in healing, something happens and brings me back to the beginning. I just wish I was able to function. I just always feel so ill and so fucking tired and lethargic and devoid of joy. I cant experience joy, and im unable to experience sadness. The closest thing I experience to sadness is fucking utter hopeless emptiness. Right now im lying in bed. I just took a bath. My limbs feel like a hundred pounds. The only thing i've eaten today is a bowl of cereal at around 12pm, but I can't stomach the thought of food. I feel so sick and lonely. 

I've been to the doctor. Im on Cipralex, and will be adding some Wellbutrin. But since nothing good actually happens ever, I don't have much hope of it working. I just want to bawl my eyes out, but I can't seem to be able to cry. I don't think i'd ever kill myself, because im too scared of dying, but the thought of having this fucking garbage pile of a life for the next few decades is really not appealing. Everyone just tells me to keep fighting. But for what? More of this? Even when im 'okay', im still numb, dead inside, unable to experience comfort, and no libido or appetite.

I've started enjoying talking to my friends and kind of look forward to talking to some people. I think that because I'm genuinely interested in talking to people, I can eventually become a fun person to talk to as well. I've also formed a genuine interest in playing the piano well, which is the first time in a while that I have a hobby which I genuinely look forward to.

I expected the old, no please don't do it, you have sm to live for routine and I really just didn't listen, I expected them to give up and leave because why wouldn't they, I'm worthless and no good.
But they said they and fought me and didn't even tell me what I wanted to hear but what I needed. Toughest love I've ever gotten. I felt bad, I love these people, I'm hurting them, but I didn't dissuade me besides I already took the pills, lemme just say what I need to right?
I told them all that I'm useless its better if I leave, I drag you down and they still fought.

I keep in touch with many of them, help them with various things, know when to crack a joke or just be supportive, and so on.  Many of them have even contacted me recently upon becoming aware of my personal view to let me know how much I mean to them and their extended family/circle of friends/etc.

But other than acknowledging that I'm a decent guy ethically, I can't view myself in any high or even decent regard because I just feel like I'm a complete and utter fuckup and failure when it comes to all the expected and even basic aspects of life.  I've never been particularly fit and don't think I'm very good looking either.  I haven't had a girlfriend since college and am still a virgin.

Where do I start, again...

So, I'm a 17 year old boy from poor country, since I'm 13, or something, I've been feeling bad, maybe because i was bullied in primary school, but idk.

I can't find anything in life that gives me happiness, or makes me feel satisfied, relaxed or something like that.
I tried everything, coding, singing, making music, playing music, piano, drawing, painting, riding a bike, skating, running, swimming, hanging out with people, and much more stuff i can't remember, none of these gave me satisfaction, i got bored of them really fast, and recently (for like 2 years now), when i try to pick something up, I just say to myself:

441,Try not using Facebook / cancerous social media for a little bit,"I never really thought I would benefit that much from cutting Facebook out of my daily routine.  I always figured that I'd rather see the stupid political posts people make, and anything else that just ended up annoying me, because I'd want to know what my peers are saying.   I also figured it would be healthier for me to see this negativity and be able to process it to the point where it wouldn't hurt to see.

But I gave it a shot, after a friend gave me the advice of just putting up some mental and emotional barriers to people and things that are a major thorn in my side.  So far after basically not using Facebook for the past month, I'd say I feel better.  I don't waste my time trying to figure out other people's problems for them.

  I generally want to be a very empathic person, but that also means that I often try to fix other people's problems when they don't want to fix them, or I try to understand someone who I won't ever be able to understand.  And that fuels my depression, letting myself act as a funnel for all the world's problems to fall into.

Just thought I'd pass on that idea.  If you're struggling with seeing a lot of negativity all around you, sometimes social media is part of the problem (or really just Facebook, other social media is fine for me but Facebook just sucks).  The principle applies to other parts of life as well: cut out negativity and it can really help you.  It's worth a shot.",1506298884.0
442,Motivational Message- being sedentary and isolated.,"The modern age has encouraged isolation and a sedentary lifestyle that is known to be a contributing to factor to a host of problems; depression being one of them. 

In a recent video, youtube contributor CGP GREY made a facetious short about how to make yourself feel miserable. Briefly: isolate yourself, stay completely sedentary and do not engage in anything meaningful. you should watch it though, [it's awesome.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o)

The video hit home with me. I have been known to hole up in my room and do nothing but mindlessly browse the net. Within the past few months, I've taken steps to break that pattern. But, I've known it was an issue long before then. As I imagine many people already know about their own time. 

Why then do we isolate ourselves and binge watch episodes of shows we're only mildly interested in? It's easier of course! That's not to say this pathway is done solely out of laziness. But, our brains are wired to want to seek out the quickest reward with the least amount of effort. It was a practical mechanism for our fore-bearers, but with our age of abundance, it works against us. You know it already. It's much like our struggle with eating junk food over a wholesome meal. 

For instance, social activities often yield sustained feelings of well-being. However, they take time and they require risk. For those of us more inclined to introversion, another night in is often so much more comfortable than putting yourself out there. Once you are able to connect with people, it's usually worth it. 

So with all of that being said, how do we break the cycle? You have to cultivate discipline to not fall back on a lifestyle that you know is not helping you. 

That hour an a half at the gym, while nearly always a pain to get going, yields a reward more than just fitness. Those feel good chemicals come with the burn. 

I think an ever bigger issue, even more than the sedentary lifestyle, is that we 'zone out' for extended periods of time. Many people spend time doing mindless, unfullfilling activities.
Sure, relaxation is good and we need that, but everyone needs hobbies. Hobbies that require you to create a finished work, or that require extended amounts of interest are usually good. The key is to keep your mind active. 

I know a lot of what I've said is known by many of us intrinsically. Still, it bears repeating. Do some things. If you identify a bit too much with the video, then you need to assess how you're spending your time. Stay well.

443,How to compartmentalize emotions to stay productive when feeling anxious/sad?,"Tl;dr: Have always been very sensitive, lately very anxious and constantly sad to the point it's been affecting my productivity. I'm hoping for tips on how to put emotions away to focus on work. 

All my life I've struggled with feeling like I was too 'sensitive', and have wanted to develop a thicker skin. I've been somewhat of a people pleaser my whole life, and always found it extremely difficult to accept when someone was upset/frustrated/disappointed with me.

When I was more confident and in a better space mentally, I was really happy, organized, hyper-productive, and generally thrived off of external validation from my superiors and peers. 

But the past few years I've been struggling with anxiety-like and depressive-like symptoms (not clinically diagnosed and don't believe it's permanent or biochemical). Even if I don't go into a full blown anxiety attack, I have a tremendously difficult time setting aside an emotionally unresolved issue to focus on work and other things that are of priority. I haven't been able to get back to half that level of productivity/energy lately, and am becoming increasingly frustrated at how much my emotions hold me back from getting things done, and just, thinking straight. 

Can you recommend any strategies you use when shit hits the fan in your personal/emotional life to retain focus on your work/obligations? How do you compartmentalize and suppress overwhelming feelings of sadness/anxiety so you're able to stay productive, and generally function optimally? How do you stop yourself from feeling like crying?? 

Also I've been in and out of counselling, and have learned various meditation/self-compassion/cognitive behavioural therapy strategies. Meditation has been a hit or miss for me, self-compassion principles sometimes feels like I'm lying myself, and I tend to get stuck with CBT at the column where you have to come up with all the reasons why the sad/anxious/depressive thought you are thinking about yourself is true, sending me back into the downward spiral. 

Maybe I'm not doing them right?? Tips or resources to just get over this extremely uncomfortable tight feeling in my chest? Not to mention crying just leaves me emotionally and physically exhausted, and I'm just drained.

445,Motivational Monday- Tips for limiting isolation,"I'm guilty of doing it. I have a low threshold for extended amounts of social interaction; it tends to be draining. With the correct balance, there are definite benefits to ensuring you're interacting with people in a social setting. 

Don't expect friends to reach out first. It's great when they do, but your chances of actually connecting with someone increase dramatically if you take the first step of initiating. It sucks feeling like you're waiting for the stars to align with certain folks, but sometimes that's just how it goes. 

Plan to go out at least once a week. It doesn't have to be necessarily social, but even getting out of the house: seeing a movie, or grabbing a drink at the pub (responsibly) is better than vegging out in front of Netflix for the Nth time. My fallback is the gym. Is it social? meh. 

Try not to turn down social engagements. If you truly do not want to go because you're genuinely not interested, don't. But, many of us have been invited to events and decide not to go because we're uncomfortable... that's lame. Make the effort to do and and many times you'll find yourself having fun.

453,"I'll never be handsome, and i can't accept that","Since i was little what kept me going forward was the idea that no matter what i was like at the moment, if i worked hard enough i could become my ideal self.

This was true especially for my looks, i thought that if i lost weight, worked out and took care of myself i could become the handsome me i envisioned, but i was wrong.

I lost weight and found out that my large hips weren't just love handles but large hip bones, i started taking care of my hair and found out i had started balding, i tried improving my face and found out i had a lot more problems i could do nothing about like a long chin, short nose, flat cheekbones and sad, tired looking downturned eyes.

It's not like I'm ugly and it's not like i care about my looks because i have problems with girls or anything, it's just that i always dreamed of one day being handsome and identified myself with that image, and now knowing that I'll never reach that dream no matter what i do feels crushing, even if it's probably a needed reality check.

How can i get over this and go on with my life?",1657392983.0
454,feeling stuck with no way forward,"I'll say this is a story you'll see posted a lot on reddit. 

I'm a 25 year old, cishet male. I live at home and have been unemployed for the past six months following termination from a retail job where I made an ass of myself. I have been working freelance for the past month as content editor for an ad agency but the pay is abyssmal with no benefits or really any skill or advancment involved. I have no friends or social life, not to mention any possibility of a relationship with anybody. Other than my family, I'm completely alone.

In addition, one family member of mine was recently diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, and I acted as her caretaker for a period of time. My dad, who I normally have a strained relationship with due to him being generally a weirdo, has been struggling with the ukrainian conflict as we have relatives in kiev. So all around there have been a lot of shitty things happening, and I have no real support network for any of it.

I graduated two years ago with a BA in English and so far have accomplished nothing. I want to grow and flourish as a person, but am still stuck in my old insecurities and failures of the past.

I'm extremely bored and depressed with my situation but I have no idea how to change. I have no confidence to move out on my own, and of course I have had difficulty holding down a job because I'm a poor worker that has trouble getting along with others. I sought out a counselor to help with my issues holding work and my overall depression and anxiety, but the only ones available with my insurance were not a good fit, to the point that the man I was matched with did not even know how to say my name on the second session.

I don't know, I'm just feeling very alone and lost and I guess this post is an attempt to just receive advice or encouragement or just talk to literally anyone about these issues. I know Reddit is generally a terrible website to bare your soul but that's where I'm at. Thanks for reading.",1650838028.0
455,So I just had to get that off my chest,"6 months ago my ex and I broke up and now I tried to avoid him so I could start to heal. Since Christmas is coming up and stuff, people would text some merry Christmas messages in group-chats. So ofc there is that mutual friend group where we both send merry Christmas wishes in and he send a gif that made me smile .. and at the same time I was feeling a slight pain in my chest remembering that it wasn't meant to be even though he was a funny guy.

I just had to get that out of my mind. Sometimes there are days where I feel good and love myself. And then there are days like these, where I succumb to the pain and wonder if I will ever have a chance to love someone who loves me back equally. 

So yeah .. here I am, smiling and crying over a gif he send. I feel dumb but also proud that I did make some progress. I hope that I will be healed soon. 

Anyone who can kinda relate to this, feel hugged! I wish you a merry Christmas",1640449605.0
456,I don't know how to be okay with how much of my life I've lost.,"I've had an unusual life so far. I was pulled out of school by my parents at a very young age. They had a lot of trouble with the school system with my older siblings and decided to not even try with me. At first, being homeschooled was fine, my parents tried to make sure a had the chance to socialize by enrolling me in a lot of after-school activities and such. But around when I was 13 financial instability caused my family, which at this point was just my parents and me as my older siblings had moved out, to have to move across the country.

What was supposed to be a brief stretch of instability turned into years of moving back and forth living with relatives never staying in one place for long. We were always just a few months away from finally being able to settle down. This period of instability ended up lasting all of my teen years. I lost touch with the few friends I had and became very reclusive. This lead to me developing crippling social anxiety that prevented me from even socializing online.

What finally ended the constant moving was my dad being diagnosed with ALS. I ended up becoming his full-time caretaker in his final years, while my mom worked. Towards the end I was feeding him through a tube, caring him to the bathroom, and waking up several times a night to help him clear his lungs of mucus. He died in 2017 at the age of 57, I was 23 at the time. The nurses told me they were shocked he made it as long as he did and that it was no doubt due to the quality of my care. I still don't know if that was a good thing or if I just prolonged his suffering.

For the rest of that year, I was aimless. Being such a recluse, my dad was also sort of my best friend. So losing him was extra hard on me. It wasn't until 24 that I got my first job. It was at a regional sandwich chain that my sister used to work at. I was extremely socially inept at this point and it took me quite a while to get used to working with others and talking to customers. I ended up leaving that job shortly after turning 25 due to the threat of layoffs in the company. I got a job at a nearby grocery store that ended up being soul-crushing. worse yet, covid hit when I was 26 and I ended up sort of getting ""stuck"" there, or at least that's what I convinced myself. The one good thing about my experience there was that It helped me come out of my shell quite a bit, even though none of the relationships I made there ended up sticking. My social struggles combined with the soul-crushing job ended up sending me into an extreme depression that turned the end of 26 and the beginning of 27 into a huge blank splotch in my mind. I was only brought out of it by starting a new job around June of this year. Not really an upgrade so much as an escape out of desperation, but I ended up liking the job a lot more and feeling a lot more appreciated.

Things were starting to look up. Most of my anxiety was gone. I had a huge breakthrough with my art, which is the thing I'm most passionate about and would like to turn into a living someday. Even though, like most things, I started extremely late with it. And even though I didn't and still don't have any social life to speak of I feel so much more confident now talking to people. I even ended up getting my high school equivalency this year. I feel like I finally have the tools to start building the kind of life I want. I spent most of the latter half of this year happier than I have ever been.

However, between depression taking up the first half of the year and adjusting to a new job in the second, this year has seemed to pass by much quicker than others. I'm now 10 days away from turning 28 and the realization of just how old I've gotten has hit me like a truck. I knew my teens were gone, but it somehow didn't occur to me that my 20s are almost over too. I haven't really enjoyed turning another year older for quite some while, but this time it's different. In my head, I still largely feel like the 13-year old I was when my life got put on hold, but now I'm closer to 40 than I am to 13. There is so much of life that I just didn't get to have. I haven't had any real friends to watch movies, play games, or just talk to since I was 12. I remember I would look at new multiplayer games coming out and fantasize about how soon I would have friends to play them with. Now I see people refer to those same games as childhood classics. And of course, that also means I was never in a relationship. Hell, I've never even had my first kiss.

I see younger people living their lives, spending time with friends, having relationships, and it hurts me. It's hurts knowing that nothing I can do can give me the time I lost back. I will never have what they have, not exactly at least. These basic human experiences are just things I missed out on. I know I can still make friends and do things now but it's different. People my age now have careers and some even have families. And on top of that, it's hard to even find them. Everywhere I go, even online, it seems like everyone is 6 to 8 years younger than me. I can't wrap my mind that I will just be starting my life at almost 30, already old by a lot of people's measures and not far from it by most.

And that's assuming everything goes smoothly from here which I have my doubts about. I'm such a strange person I can't imagine it will be easy for me to find deep meaningful relationships. I didn't grow up with peers to shape my identity so I don't really fit in anywhere. I also have developed strange interests that, for better or worse, are a part of me, and it's difficult to open up to people about that stuff. For example the art I was talking about, what I mostly do wouldn't be to everyone's tastes. And I also lack a lot of interests most people seem to have. I don't like to ""party"". Loud crowded environments aren't really my thing. I also haven't ever done anything more mind-altering than caffeine, not even alcohol and I don't really plan to start. I wasn't raised to dislike it or anything, nor did I have any bad examples. Hell, my dad was the sharpest, hardest working person I've ever known and he was a huge stoner. But even from a very young age, I disliked the idea of the way I feel being the result of something I took. And of course, that's just me. I don't have a problem with anyone else doing what they want, but it's just another thing that makes it hard for me to fit in.

And then theirs dating. I'll be honest, not having a partner bothers me a lot. The lack of sex is one thing, but it's really the lack of companionship and being wanted that hurts. I don't know how to approach girls that I'm interested in. I don't know show interest without being creepy. I made that mistake with someone at my last job and it feels awful, I never wanted to see myself as that kind of person. What makes it worse is that the way I was acting wasn't natural for me at all, but I didn't know how else to show that I was interested in her. And also, who would want me over anyone else? Why exactly would you go for the 28 year old inexperienced, friendless virgin over anyone else? But what am I supposed to do, lie? Yeah, that sounds like a great way to start a relationship.

But really all of this is beside the point. Because right now I can barely even get out of bed in the morning. I finally feel like I have the tools, but it seems like too little too late. Nothing I do know will give me that chance to be a teenager or a 20-something. I'll be 30 before I know it and 40 won't be too far behind. So little time to build the skills and relationships I wanted to before I became a middle-aged man, and I haven't even started. I feel like my life has been cut short, only from the wrong end. And that's assuming it isn't cut short from the other end as well like it was for my dad. It feels like I lost my opportunity to have a truly good life and the best I can go for now is ""good considering"". And I don't know how I'm supposed to cope with that. I know that I should just live my life and not worry about time. I know that there are lots of people my age who feel unfulfilled in life, many in a position not too dissimilar to mine. But I just don't know how I'm just supposed to move on and be okay with all the time that I missed out on. And it terrifies me.",1638761137.0
457,Grieving the loss of who you thought someone was,"I’ve always had a habit of falling for smooth talking guys who make me believe that they’re something they’re not. I’d fall for a fantasy rather than the guy himself. I haven’t been wise enough to know better. They’re smooth words about a future together would win me over.. I wanted so badly to believe what they said to me. 

So I’d get my hopes up, and start envisioning our lives together. I think of them constantly. He’d be the first thing I think of in the morning and when I went to bed. In my mind, we’d somehow always be in one another’s lives. And eventually, I realize… that those special things being said to me are not exclusive to me. He says those things to others too. And once he finds someone else and ditches me, I realize how I was nowhere near as significant to them as I thought I was. He’d become important to me, and I thought I was to him.. and I find myself grieving a man who didn’t really exist. 

At first I’d make excuses for him. I’d blame myself for pushing him away, or not saying the right things in the right way. I’d find myself mentally begging him to come back, but he doesn’t. All of a sudden something that felt safe made me feel exposed, vulnerable, and disempowered. 

I rationally know that this isn’t the guy for me. The one for me would never end up making me feel this way. The right one wouldn’t leave just as easily as he entered me life. And yet, I grieve every time. I miss thinking fondly of this person. Believing in him, in us. 

TLDR; I have a difficult time getting over them even when I realize he wasn’t who he pretended to be. I always would blame myself immediately afterwards, until I took a considerable amount of time to process things and realize what happened. I shouldn’t want something that I now know doesn’t exist. How can I stop feeling so bad every time? (Yes there were many times)",1624883599.0
458,Any advice on how to go out and not come back salty about being lonely?,"I’ve learned trying to have fun alone is beneficial for a lot of things, like self esteem and confidence, and it’s a huge step toward getting over depression and burnout from staying in and working.

Lately, I’ve been seeing other people have fun in couples/groups, and I’d like to have that again. My issue is that I do my thing for a little while, and then I end up observing everyone else all around me and I just sorta wish I had my own group sometimes? Is that jealousy/selfishness?

459,"If you have to deal with someone difficult, don't let it ruin your day - figuring out why they're so annoying can help you grow and let go of suffering","If you had to picture someone you find difficult to deal with, you probably wouldn’t find it too difficult. We all know someone who always seem to have their grump on - we dread interacting with them because their behaviour doesn’t seem reasonable to us. We might feel like they bring out the worst in us as well, that we’re stressed, angry or just miserable when we have to deal with them. We don’t like those feelings so we don’t like the person that’s associated with them.

Because being annoyed at someone is unpleasant we can sometimes try and shut it out but if we avoid being present with the feeling then we can’t tend to our anger or anxiety and deeply into it. We can start off by holding the feelings you have for that person mindfully in your awareness without judging yourself for having them. Give yourself permission to feel whatever you find - it’s OK to be annoyed, stressed or down.

So by accepting that we’re feeling, we can begin to think about the roots. What is it about this person’s behaviour that pushes our buttons? Being annoyed at someone is actually a great opportunity to explore yourself and I find that when I’m ticked off it’s as much an expression of my fear or insecurity as it is their behaviour - for example it might be insecurity about whether I’m doing a good job. I can then realise my attachment to how I’m perceived and start to let go simply by holding that attachment in my awareness and smiling to it.

As well as compassion for yourself, it really helps to develop a little compassion for your antagonist. It’s easy for us to project our own lives onto the person you’re annoyed at and say “look how unreasonable this person is!”; but of course, they haven’t lived our lives and we haven’t lived theirs. If we could see their lives then we would see the trauma from circumstances beyond their control that has led them to where they are today. 

Happy, secure people at ease with themselves don’t go around pushing other people’s buttons. Seeing that person through the eyes of understanding can release some of the anger that we feel. By wishing them well, we can liberate ourselves from suffering: may you be happy, may you be peaceful, may you look at yourself through the eyes of understanding and compassion.

It’s worth being clear though that noone should have to put up with bullying. If that’s what you’re experiencing, speak to someone you trust for support; abuse is not OK in any context. Your relationship with someone shouldn’t be causing you harm or impacting your mental health so if it’s possible to create some space between you and them I would encourage you to do so; nothing is more important than your peace.

460,Look after your mental health by setting up a proper sleep/morning routine. Go to bed and get up at set times - even on the weekend,"Starting your day off well doesn’t involve a huge amount of rocket science but it does need a bit of patience and persistence. The key thing is setting up new habits and sticking to them every day, even on the weekend. The most important of these is your sleep hygiene.

The temptation is to use the weekend for a lie in, but if you’re like me and occasionally get insomnia the answer is to have a set time for going to bed and getting up. Getting into a rhythm in this way means that your body is ready for sleep at bedtime and is ready to rise in the morning. It’s also helpful to avoid the things that interfere with your sleep like alcohol and particularly caffeine - most of my insomnia (and anxiety) was caused by my coffee habit.

For the same reason its a good idea to keep mobiles and laptops out of the bedroom, they interfere with sleep and they also make it more difficult to get out of bed. Starting your morning with social media, which is designed to get a reaction from us, doesn’t set you up well for the day.

On to your morning routine - some activity as soon as as you get up is helpful. Whether you’re doing stretching, movement or yoga focus your awareness on your breath and what you can feel in your body rather than whats coming up in your day.

You can then sit for a guided meditation, morning is a great time to practice gratitude. Its the one trait that happy people have in common and its vital for cultivating our happiness, especially in the morning when our mind is in a suggestible state. 

Finally, you can practice mindful drinking and mindful eating with breakfast, paying all of your attention to each mouthful of food, being aware of the smell, texture and flavours, eating slowly and putting the spoon down between bites. Keeping in mind everything that went into it as you eat is another way to integrate gratitude into the start of your day.

461,A great thanks!,"I’m (45F)3 weeks out of a mental breakdown. My family does not know the extent of my mental illness, just my husband.I was nervous about all the holidays coming up and today, this happened!...
 For some background, my family is “country poor”. If you’re not familiar with the term, it means you don’t have money to spend on anything that you can make, grow, raise or kill on your own. We live in the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee. Since I was knee high to a grasshopper ( I added that just for fun)I’ve been obsessed with clothes and fashion. When I finished school and started making my own money, clothes became my priority, especially shoes. When we were kids, you got a new pair of shoes at the start of each school year and that was it. My husband and I are in good financial shape. I don’t have a large wardrobe, but what I have is, mostly, high end or designer clothes and shoes. My hair and makeup are always done. I take a lot of pride in my appearance, but when I fall into a depression, I completely let things go. Days and days of not even a shower. I’m really fighting to get back to a good place since my breakdown. I had a lot of anxiety about getting dressed and going to dinner with my family today. 
  When I walked through the door, my nephew and his wife were standing there waiting for me to come in. I paused and they both started smiling. I asked what that was all about. My nephew told me that their favorite part of family get togethers is watching me come in. He said,”you always look as though you’ve just come down from Beverly Hills!”. Y’all, I had to get to the other room because I got so teary eyed. I don’t know if I’ve ever had a compliment, in my life, that set me on a cloud like that did. It’s been a great day! I just wanted to share some happy!",1606426513.0
462,I feel relieved that I've left my friend's group chat!,"I have been really depressed off-late. As a result, I recently left my friend's group in some sort of moment of rage sort of acts. I was also kind of hoping that they would notice it and ask me to come back but they haven't. But I weirdly feel relieved now. I feel like I have more time to myself even though it's only early days. I don't feel sad that they haven't messaged me back. in fact, I'm pretty confident and don't resent them at all. 

&#x200B;

I just feel like I have given myself the space to focus on myself now. I don't feel hopeful or anything optimistic like that yet, but it feels like I know have an avenue to grow by myself. I'm going to start this journey by sleeping a bit earlier everything and eventually be asleep by 11:30 so that I can wake up at around 7AM!",1605553058.0
463,"Moving past unrequited love. Everything helps, a bit.. just not quite enough","I have tried everything I can think of to try and help myself with this. I regularly write down my thoughts and feelings as an outlet. I have well over 11,000 words, not including stuff I’ve deleted / edited. It helps to write stuff for sure, but it’s also dangerous, since I re-read when I’m feeling emotional, which feels like indulging myself, and I get overwhelming desires to then send the stuff to EK. And he doesn’t want me to, so that’s not an option.

I have thrown myself into my work. That helps immensely, especially during weekdays, but is also completely exhausting. I don’t want to stop working at 5pm because I know that if I do, my thoughts and habits will drift towards EK, so I work long days instead. The alternative is to stop working and do something else which keeps my mind occupied, which is fine - I do that sometimes too, but that is equally as exhausting, since I can never just relax and do nothing. And I don’t usually enjoy other stuff as much as my work anyway. My mind needs to be occupied constantly. I have trouble sleeping because my mind is in overdrive at night too, so I’m pretty tired and don’t always feel like doing stuff all the time. 

I have spoken to people. I’ve had many appointments with university wellbeing / counselling (both student and staff services). I’ve spoken to my other supervisor and other staff at the Uni. I’ve spoken to several crisis support services including Samaritans. Talking has helped too, and has given me some perspective on everything. I’ve spoken to friends and family, and everyone is sick of me talking about it. 

I’ve tried online dating but I cannot get excited about, or invested in anyone. Even in person, it takes me months, and a lot of exposure to someone for me to develop feelings. Initially I tried to go with it anyway, and met a few guys through dating, but it was all so phoney. I hated it and I hated myself for going along with it. I instead have tried recently to occupy my heart with the only other guy who I have ever felt genuine interest in. That seems to be going okay-ish, and I feel good about it, but he lives hours away, we speak maybe once a week, we haven’t met for years (and won’t be able to anytime soon), and he works a job which means he is away at sea for half of the year. And so far the interest seems pretty one-sided, so I’m not sure. 

This has been incredibly difficult and painful for me for well over a year now. At times I have felt like I am over the worse of it. I am certainly a stronger person for having been through this. But, then I am reminded that I am not over it at all. Right now I feel as bad as I ever have. It feels as raw as it ever has. It has reached a point now where a part of me wants me to die, just because it’s the only way I can tell EK how I feel about him. 

I don’t know if I can live my life through distractions without exhausting myself and burning out. I don’t know what else I can try. I don’t know how much longer I can stay strong and hope that things get better, without going insane.",1602973247.0

The problem is how fast things changed for me. I'm used to anger being my baseline, my default state. Now my default state is nothing. When I do feel angry, it's far less than what I used to feel and usually the result of something that directly happened to me. I don't get that intense anger that made me fear that I was going to lose control of myself anymore. When you've spent so much time steeped in anger, you become used to it. Now it feels as if my emotions are less intense because I'm not angry all the time, like a part of me is gone. I tried to make myself angry today, just to feel that burning anger again, and it was hard. I can only capture a part of that burning rage.

466,"Been off of antidepressants for a year, lost 100 lbs, better energy and health but less motivation that when I do feels forced and an overall flat feeling still remains?","I know this is a selfish time to post this because of what's going on in the world currently at this time but I felt like that I had to post this.

&#x200B;

A year ago I decided to get off of antidepressants and start trying to improve my mood on my own. I managed to lose 100 lbs and get more energy in the long run but there are still some issues.

&#x200B;

Back on 4th of July 2019 my first cousin once removed threw like ten/fifteen poppers in a row right near my right ear in a crowded area that echoed. This caused me to lose about ten decibels of hearing in my right ear (plus my right ear sounds a bit more muffled and all that now. I also didn't take steps to protect my hearing/stay away from loud noise for a while/etc. after that incident.) Now my hearing is a bit off in both ears in different ways. Left ear hears louder and clearer but things like echoes or drum beats in songs, and bass I don't hear as good in my left ear. My right ear doesn't hear as loud or clear as my left but yet certain things like drum beats, bass, echoes, reverberation, etc. I can hear fuller in my right ear. It's weird. I can't enjoy music as much anymore though because of the weirdness whether it be not as full sound in my left ear or more muffled/quieter sound in my right ear. Ever since then I've gotten a $60 sound pressure level meter to keep control of sound. It measures in A and C. A basically is more attuned to the human ear but doesn't tally in bass frequencies all that well where as C takes bass more into account because the human ear is less sensitive to bass. I've heard it can be as much off as 10 decibels though and whenever it goes to 70 or higher I start panicking and freaking.

&#x200B;

Anyways that's step one. I even had a job at a university as a dishwasher and was in college again. Things were going ok. I cut out a ton of crud in my diet and lost 100 lbs and started doing a lot more cardio even now walking between an hour a day to five hours a day three days in a row give or take. I've never walked more then three days in a row or taken more than three days off of walking though. Anyways this resulted in me losing 100 lbs. I also don't do anything other than caffeine or nicotine (yes I do smoke cigs, the one thing I really still need to change in my health but it's been tough. I only smoke one every two hours or so though. Still not good though.)

Also during this time I've noticed that my memory isn't as clear or sharp as it used to be. I barely remember anything short term anymore and I can't remember things I've watched/played/listened to etc. worth a crud no matter how much I focus on them. It really bums me out and even haven't done really all that great on tests at college because of this.

&#x200B;

Now the main thing is that I just feel kind of bleh most of the time. I absolutely abhor doing almost anything that isn't selfish or things that I like and when I do those things I just feel pretty much flat. I never feel more than maybe a 6 out of 10 on a good day. I'm worried about taking antidepressants again though because I've tried five different ones. Two didn't work at all (one even caused bad side effects), two worked but raised my liver enzymes and one worked slightly at the max recommended dose without side effects but not really worth it as it made me worried about interactions with foods, drinks, etc.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I got an over the phone appointment in a week and I'm just kind of bleh. I don't derive any fun from anything anymore. I have more energy from losing that weight and less health problems overall but my motivation feels forced and not genuine and mood is just bleh all the time.

&#x200B;

I do not have suicidal thoughts I do not want to die or not live anymore at all. So I'm not there but at the same time I feel bleh or just going through the motions. Flat. What should I do? Thank you very much.

467,(28f) I dont have the energy to do anything...,"I dont understand how prople wake up, and do all these athletic things.. (probably not now with the pandemic) but i see people are so thin, they so so much and have the energy to do absolutely anything.

All i did as a morning to afternoon, Woke up at 9, laid there until 10, had breakfast with my mom, and just sat on the couch with her doing nothing..

NOTHING

and i had no energy to do anything. Not even hungry with any idea in what to eat.

Me and my mom suffer from situational depression / anxiety. And when it happens or when we dont have any energy, we also lose our appetite..

Ironically, we're not thin either. My mom is overweight at 62, and i would be the ""smallest"" in the family so far, and im in the slightly heavy side of chubby (due to my body type it all goes to the lower half mostly). Our family line involces people who eat a lot but we dont exercise. Some relatives dance but its accompanied by a party and tons of alcohol (and i dont talk to those relatives but its a general idea in how unhealthy my family is)..

I need to exercise, but i dont feel like doing anything...

468,Does anyone get depression-like fatigue without the moodiness after your depression improved?,"I haven't had a bad episode that lasted more than a day or two in a few years, but lately I've been feeling extremely tired and it kind of reminds me of depression, except without the mood component.

469,Is it frowned upon to say that I think money is the only thing that will make me happy?,"Due to the holidays over the last 2 weeks, I broke from my usual routine. During this time I

* visited with friends I only see about every 12 months
* visited with my family and nieces
* visited with my extended family
* traveled back to home town
* discussed business plans with friends

During most of these events, I had really depressive thoughts, even if I acted confident, happy, etc.

I'm in my early 30's. I've had a variety of jobs, volunteered, military, college, etc. About 80% of my adult life, I've been broke. Not because of bad budgeting, but because I'd try a business idea, it would fail, I'd have debt, etc. repeat. Now I'm about $30K in debt, and have lost my job.

I honestly think if I had a nice house, car, and $1M in the bank I would be just about as happy as I could be. I know people say this shouldn't be the case, but honestly nothing else makes me happy. Money in the bank allows clarity, presence and focus, which is the true way to enjoy life.

470,How to help a person that wants to kill themself?,"My best friend is extremely suicidal and is going through some of the worst stuff in her life right now.

I wouldn't dare to drop her as a friend or love her any less, but I don't know what to do anymore. 

I moved to uni that's about 45 minutes from my hometown/where she is and I feel incredibly guilty that I can't be there every time she needs me, especially when she keeps threatening suicide (I don't have a car here, so I can't drive over to see her often). I call her/text her when I can, I listen to her vent, and I always try to make myself available for her, but I feel like it's never enough. She's currently on a 6 month treatment plan and seeing a therapist, but it doesn't seem to be working. 

I'm so, so worried for her and I'm afraid that every second I'm not talking to her, she's trying to kill herself. I don't know what to do for her, because I don't want her to die, but at this point I feel like I can't do anything or say anything that even matters.

I feel like I can confidentally say that after 1 year of on and off therapy and lots of time to reflect on myself that I have successfully beat my depression.

Situationally, nothing has actually changed in my life since the past year;

I still have no friends

I still get anxious in social situations

I still have intrusive violent thoughts 

I'm still wasting most of my free time on the internet

I'm still broke and living with my parents

I've still never had a romantic partner

And I still have no goals or deep passion for anything

But I don't punish myself for being this way. Unfortunate as it is, it is part of human nature to be lazy, apathetic, violent, scared of harmless things, and I am no different! I don't have to kill myself for being human. What matters more though is that I don't act on my thoughts and harm other people lol.

I don't want to remain this way forever though so I am trying to change my habits however I can, although it tires me most of the time. I have two jobs now, whereas before, I was unemployed (and broken from the reality of my industry) so I am making some progress. I'm also still bored with my life but I am trying to make it more fun by picking up new hobbies, taking myself out to dates etc.

473,I feel handicapped by depression and it's dragging me down too far,"Everything I do feels handicapped.

Decisions, reactions, thinking, they all just feel like they weren't thought out, they feel they could've been better, if the older, non-depressed version of me made them. I feel like everything I do is wrong, without flavor, and that happiness acts like a drug that ends very fast.

I cannot study properly, I can't play video games well anymore, I cannot succeed in anything I do. I feel like a man with no arms trying to write. I feel pounded on my heart with every step I make, it's like there's something sitting on it and I cannot get it out. It feels like it's trapped in there forever. It's dragging me down too further.

I need to pass exams, I need to decide my future, I need to move right now. I cannot do it like this. It's munching me out day by day, I feel helpless, like nothing could help me, and that I'm going to die being eaten by me compressed sadness.

475,What has helped me - looking at things objectively,"Over the past few years, I've gone through phases of being at rock bottom, doing really well, and everything in between. I'm sure this sounds familiar to most of you. So I'm making this thread for two reasons: partly to share what has helped me stay around the 6 or 7 or 8 out of 10 rather than 2 or 3 out of 10. But more-so, I want to hammer the point that it's so important to look at things objectively and know what helps you feel better and what makes you feel like dirt, because once you're feeling low, it's hard to remember that there are things you can do that WILL make you feel better.  So my suggestion to you all is this - get out a notepad and pen and make a list of things that make you feel good and bad with a numerical value from 1-10 for each one showing how much better it tends to make you feel. You don't have to work on every single one every day; rather, if all you can muster is one or two things on the list, that alone will make you feel just a bit better. With that said, here is my list:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

-Going to the gym / exercising: 1-3  
-No excessive porn / masturbating: 1-2  
-Eating healthy / not binge eating: 1-2  
-Getting enough sleep: .5-1.5  
-Not wasting massive amounts of time on streaming videos/browsing the internet/phone apps (including staying in bed for hours): .5-1.5  
-Meditating: .5-1  
-Not smoking: .5-1  
-Seeing a therapist: .5-1  
-Making a list of things I need to do: .5-1 
(This DOESN'T mean you need to go through every single thing on your list; on the contrary, it's more-so just to get everything out on paper so you're not constantly worrying about things you need to do or forgot to do. Hell, you don't REALLY need to do anything on the list if it's not that important to you or you're not at a good place to do it, but just put it on paper to give you some sanity. I like to separate this list to include short-term urgent things and long-term things).   
-Doing laundry timely and having clean clothes: .5-1  
-Keeping my room clean: .5  
-Not biting my nails: .5  

&nbsp;
&nbsp; 

So when you're at a 3/10, LOOK AT THIS LIST. You KNOW that if you exercise, you will feel better, and you'll be at a 5 instead of a 3. And guess what - now that you're at a 5, you have enough energy to also meditate for just 10 minutes, and now you're at a 6. And maybe the next day right after work you do your laundry and buy a salad instead of going to Wendy's, and you're finally at that 7. It's all a domino effect. But you HAVE to look at your objective list and realize that doing things on that list WILL make you feel better. Maybe you'll only be at a 5 instead of a 7, but that’s way better than a 3, and that will lead you to getting out of your rut in just a few days instead of 2 weeks.

&nbsp; 
&nbsp; 

Just a few more points: all these things add up to more than 10 on the 1-10 scale, but doing these things will usually put me around 6-8 out of 10, and that's a great thing. It means that you don't need to do every single thing on your list every day. Rather, making sure you do at least a few things (or even just one thing) will make you feel better.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Also, know that these things will most likely not get you out of a depression. Rather, this will give you a good stable base so you're not feeling absolutely lousy. This in turn will give you the opportunity, if you're feeling up to it, to do things that are really important to you and are more likely to have a permanent effect on your depression, like working on your passion, hobbies, doing something new, progressing in your career, being with family/friends/significant other, or whatever else it is that is most important to you.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Make a list that is specific to you and you know based on prior experience will help you get better. Be realistic about it and don't put anything that you don't think you can do. For example, I know socializing and reaching out to family and friends help me, but I'm not at a good place right now to reach out to people. So I'm not putting this on my list RIGHT NOW. I might put it there if and when I'm ready. Some other things help me, like music. But this doesn't tend to make me feel better for more than a few minutes or maybe an hour. So I didn't put it on the list - don't make your list overwhelmingly long.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Last, know that due to our mental illness, we are more likely to go through rough times than the average person. You WILL struggle and get back to that hopeless 3/10 feeling. But what's important is to get back up and use the appropriate tools to make sure you get back up faster than you would have otherwise. Whether that's after a few hours, days, weeks, or months - as long as it's faster than what you've done before, it's means you're progressing. For me, my lowest of lows usually last at least 2-4 weeks before I can drag myself back up. But this list helps my lows stay towards the 2 week mark or less.

476,How do you take proper care of yourself when your depression is so bad?,"My depression has gotten better in a lot of areas, not so much in others.  One thing I really struggle with is showering and getting dressed every day.  For years and years I've pretty much lived in pajamas.  I usually only shower when I know I have to go somewhere.  

I know, it's disgusting.  I feel like a gross, sad human being.  I just...can't do it though.  It's beyond a lack of motivation, it's a total block.  It's so intense that sometimes it feels more physical than mental.  Like I think ""I should take a shower"" and suddenly I'm encased in concrete.  I know there are people who will say ""just do it, just make yourself do it"" but I *can't*.  I just can't bring myself to do it.  It's horrible.

I *know* I would feel better about myself and hate myself a lot less if I could do it.  If I were able to shower every day, get dressed, brush my hair, do my makeup, I know I'd feel better.  I just can't do it right now.

I've tried finding ways to make it a habit.  Start with comfy clothes like sweatpants.  Shower at least every other day.  Put on some light makeup.  Brush my hair.  I can never keep the habit though, it always becomes too much and I fall back into my dark hole of being unable to do it.

478,I just went outside...,"and I think it really had a tremendous effect on my mood. When I woke up, I was really reluctant to get out of bed. But because 4% of my grades would be dependent on going to class, I went.

Whenever I go to college for my classes, I walk to the nearest monorail train station. The walk isn't that long, but there is a lot of nature and sun around me, since I live in an urban area filled with lots of greenery. 

I went to class, and I met up with some friends. Some of them were really concerned with why I wasn't coming for classes the past few days, and it made me feel loved supported. One of them is also going to send me the answers for a tutorial.

When it was time to go back home, I walked from the station back to my house. I decided to take a different route, so I walked up this hill to get to my house. I worked up a bit of sweat, so when I got back home I got myself a cold drink.

Something felt different after that. I felt more active. I felt like going for a run in the evening. I felt like... I can do overcome this pit, if I take it one step at a time, even when I don't feel like it. Compared to how I felt this morning, I felt better.

So, if you feel down, why not try taking a walk at a park somewhere. If you can't find one, try walking around your block. Do it in the morning of course, since it's dangerous at night. Plus, you'll get them vitamin Ds. 

If you really don't feel like it, then just go outside for at least one minute. It's like nothing, right? Just try going outside for at least one minute. Keep that up, make it a habit, and then when you feel like you're ready, try going outside for two minutes, three minutes, etcetc.

479,"My girlfriend lives with depression and lashes out on me frequently. I want to support her, but where is the line?","I've known my girlfriend for about four months now, and even in the beginning, when we were just friends, I knew she was a really special person that I wanted to keep around in my life. She's sensitive, creative, empathetic, and loving—literally everything I could ever hope for in a partner. However, she is diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, and sometimes I start to feel like she's simply not healthy enough to be in a relationship. 

I say this because she often projects onto or manipulates me. Our arguments fall into consistent patterns. Little things I do or say (that I have every right to do or say) will hit her insecurities and cause her to break down and lash out. If I try to leave the situation because of the way I'm being treated, she accuses me of not caring and not understanding how she's feeling, even if it's irrational. 

For example, once we got drunk together with some of our friends, and when we went into the bathroom to change, she started flirting with me and asking me to ""help"" her. Since the relationship was very new and we hadn't gone far physically yet, I gently and lightly said, ""No, we're too drunk for that."" I knew rejecting somebody in that scenario could be awkward, so I tried my very best to be gentle, but she still got very upset. She went back to the room and talked to no one, just turned into the wall and silently cried. I tried to comfort her and ask her to talk, but she refused, so I went back to talking with my friends. I figured she needed to be left alone. However, she got mad at my reaction to her sadness and left. I tried not to let her leave drunk, but she ripped her things out of my hands and told me not to follow her. She then proceeded to call me multiple times to say that now she was lost on campus and she couldn't believe I let her leave drunk like that. For a whole weekend, we argued, and I eventually got so exasperated that I broke up with her. I said that she had no right to act the way she did, regardless of what she was feeling, and to apologize for anything I did would be to apologize for gently setting boundaries. She argued that she wasn't upset that I set a boundary--only that I didn't handle it well when she felt sad and insecure (to which I told her she refused to communicate on any level). Eventually, she apologized and admitted that she shouldn't have even been drinking on her medication. She said she was out of line and that she had no right to act like that, and she promised not to handle her insecurities like that in the future. I forgave her and apologized for reacting as rashly as I did, and we agreed to give the relationship another try.

However, only a week later, a similar incident occurred. She ran out of medicine and had a terrible day. I tried to be understanding, was sending her affirming texts, etc., but all she wanted was for me to come be with her. I gently told her that I couldn't because I had a full day of class and work, but she continued to try to push me to blow those things off. I got upset and told her that she was being manipulative and needed to accept that, even though I DO care and want her to feel better, I can't physically be with her today. Again, she flipped the problem onto me, claiming that I should have been nicer in the way I rejected her. I tried to point out that, when I was being gentle and supportive, she wasn't respecting me, but she refused to acknowledge this. She just kept blaming me for my reaction to her guilting. Finally, I told her that I needed space for the night (the argument was going in circles, and it was midterms week--I was really busy), and this made her even more angry. Her response was, ""Oh, so the moment I step out of line, you just completely abandon me on one of my worst days?"" Again, it took her days to admit she'd been out of line.

At this point in time, I've asked for a break. She accused me of having never cared for her and said that she's tired of loving people more than they love her. That's not true. I do care about my girlfriend tremendously and, for every argument like this, there have been plenty of good nights and moments when being with her feels wonderful. 

I don't want to lose her. I've done loads of research, trying to understand how she feels and what the best things to say for comfort are. I've also done research on how to take care of yourself when your partner is depressed, and the advice seems to be set boundaries and high standards for treatment. 

I'm just having a rough time because it seems there is so much advice out there for how to comfort a depressed person and how to deal with it when they shut you out, but there is not a lot of information on what to do when a depressed person is mistreating/manipulating you. I want to comfort my girlfriend, but I feel like I'm consistently being put into a situation where my own self-respect is being threatened if I do so. I've been in an abusive relationship before with someone who had bipolar disorder, so I know what it's like to get to a point where you've totally sacrificed your own respect and boundaries in order to show empathy for someone who only abuses it. While my girlfriend is nothing like my abusive ex in that she genuinely cares for me and, on her good days, does everything to be there for me--as well as takes accountability for her mistakes--she does act in very cyclic ways. ""I'm sorry"" is starting to mean less and less. I try to be understanding of my girlfriend's feelings—I know she can't control them—but at what point do I decide that, regardless of feelings, her actions are unacceptable?

I really care about her and want to make this work, but I'm not willing to disrespect myself or lower my own standards. Are there some last-effort pieces of advice anyone can give me? Or should I walk away and accept that my girlfriend needs to sort through this on her own?",1520800169.0

I've been living essentially in a corner of a room in a relative's apt for 1.5 years. I rarely have social interactions. Maybe a dozen conversations outside of the house in the past year, if that. That is really hard for me. I look back on all these months and cry because I'm literally not out in the world, all this time feels so wasted.

I don't have a job or car, and I can only walk so far til there is the highway not safe to walk on.  My family is very dysfunctional and cannot be of any help when it comes to those things btw.

I think I have major depression and anxiety, maybe ADHD also. I don't want to self diagnose, but I am aware of my symptoms.

Some days I feel like I'm going to lose it, like I get so upset and frustrated for being in the same 4 walls for so long.  Before this, I also lived in isolation for a year somewhere else.  Same situation, no car, no job, no walkability.  This is an ongoing pattern that's wearing me down.

Some days I try really hard to keep optimistic, and I can always find beauty and appreciation in things like the sky, trees, and fresh air.  Even then I also feel like I'm suppressing a huge amount of emotions, and they all come back eventually.

I need to change my life.  But I have no clue what to do and could use some help knowing what to do next. I'm a good person and I have a lot of good qualities. I get ideas some times but I get really scared or doubtful.  But I did just start online classes for some gen eds, since I have some old credits from the past.

- the uncontrollable crying (sometimes for no reason)
- the constant emptiness/lack of emotions
- loss of the will to live (never once suicidal, I got onto this before it got that bad)
- the **constant** bad thoughts, anxiety, nervousness, **constant** fight or flight response.
- neck and back pain from hunched over shoulders

Sound familiar? The list goes on...

Basically, over a period of about three years and many psychology sessions later, I committed to eating well, meditating, exercising, sleeping properly **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY**: Changing my mindset. And it. God. Damn. Worked.

**My mindset goal NO.1**:

I wrote it in big letters on my wall so I remembered it every day: 

""It's not you, **It's just the depression**"".

No matter how shit I would feel, I'd just think ""Ah, the depression. I need to fix this. It's annoying."" I would sometimes even laugh at it because of how ridiculous it was. I just had this fucking bloke called ""depression"" annoying me all day, so I decided to take action to get rid of the bastard.

**My mindset goal NO.2**

It was to **always do**, and **think** in a good way.

What does this mean? Well what helped with this was *visualising* the person I wanted to be. Look in the mirror if it helps. I would vividly picture myself standing up straight, smiling, acting cool and calm. I would visualise a person who people could trust. I would visualise a person who **persisted through tough times, and smiled when things were in their darkest hour**. (This was one of the biggest ones).

""The good way"" of thinking and acting for me was definitely based a lot on buddhism. Whether it be loving yourself for who you are, respecting yourself, or not caring what others say about you, making others happy, or not putting others down. (Reading about Buddhism helped me to figure out what the ""the good way"" actually was)

These are some of the **real world actions** I did to ""cure"" myself:

- **I stopped. Fucking. Thinking**

Overthinking is what strengthens the **PHYSICAL** pathways in your brain that makes these depressive habits even real.
Every time I had a bad thought about **someone else** or **myself**, I'd meditate. Concentrate on ONLY my breathing, and simply *stop thinking*. I'd literally *stop the bad thoughts in their tracks* and just stop thinking. This takes lots of repetition **every day**, and for quite a while, to strengthen the positive habits and neurological pathways in your brain. (Yes, we're *physically* rewiring our brains here).

**- I would constantly be seeking help**

Psychologists, Ted talks, reading about meditation, YouTube videos about meditation and dealing with depression. Anything I could find.
I would read, stay hungry, and always be learning.


**- I stopped ""owning"" depression.**

Depression for me is a reason, NOT an excuse for the bad things I think and feel. It isn't cool. People shouldn't feel sorry for me. No one owes me SHIT for having this disgusting illness. No one cares.
This is my own personal journey.

**- I made it a big objective not to effect anyone else with my mood, so the depression didn't ""rub off"" on them.**

I'm not sure how exactly this helped, but it definitely did!

**- I instilled *structure* and *discipline* in all aspects of my daily life.**

This included eating **well** and **regularly**, every day. Brushing my teeth **every** morning and night. Even Making my goddamn bed every morning! It's the little things that contributed to my overall sense of structure and discipline.

We humans are weird, and need structure and discipline to be happy and healthy. At least I do...

**- I exercised**

Even just half an hour a day, whether it be the gym or just going on a walk. This is important.


Today, I can honestly say it's cured. I haven't been sick for a year, I'm active, I have better friendships, people like me (finally).
I have to keep my structure and discipline still, every day, but that becomes an easy habit. IT IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLE!

I goddamn cried of happiness the other day, you know how overwhelming good feelings are when you haven't felt them for so many years?

I'm still always working on it, and it's all just up from here. I hope this helps.

I feel like I'm starting from scratch and that's not something I really want to do, but I know there's really no choice other than to do it anyways. How can I be happy like this though.

487,"It's not the depression, but the boredom.","Depression can be manageable if you have friends to do things with to soften the mental destitution, but over the past year most of my good friends have moved on to other parts of the country for better opportunities, or because they couldn't afford to live in NY any longer as young millenials with little relevant job experience.
So here I sit, 25 years old, still living with my parents. I work a blah-it's-boring-but-it's-better-than-nothing retail job at CVS (full-time, at least) with a BA in English and a minor in Media Studies. Don't ask me why, I don't even know. I was a pretty dumb guy in college and had a very narrow world-view, and I assumed incorrectly that a BA in anything would get me gainful employment. Only bright side to it is that I don't have student loan debt and I may possibly be able to go back to school next year for a BBA in Accounting, something that I've begun to see as recession-proof despite the relative monotony of the job. But hey, boring jobs are my forte. I've survived them, at least with an accounting gig I can survive it and have a liveable wage to show for it.
I guess it's better than two years ago. In the winter of 2014 I was on the cusp of legitimately killing myself. I spent a week in a mental hospital, underwent psychiatric evaluation, got on meds, got re-evaluated for other ADD/ADHD related disorder, got prescribed Adderall XR, and life hasn't been too bad. At the very least it seems like there's a tangible light at the end of the tunnel.
Yet the days drag on slowly, no one to really hang out with, and not enough money to do stuff to meet new people. I'm trying to save money as best as I can so that I can afford to fix my car. It's fortunate for me that my job is within walking distance from home, so I can save on gas.
I should be feeling thankful. I know I'm in a better situation than I was years ago, and most people on this sub. Yet there have been days for the past month where I'm on the verge of just snapping back and regressing into my old, dismissive, depressive mantras. I just want someone to hang out with that I can relax around and be comfortable with, I want to start dating again, I want to stop being the socially anxious weirdo all the time. I don't want to vegetate in my room constantly locked in a never-ending battle against my own negative thoughts.",1472621223.0

I've nobody to talk to you about this so i said id try the internet.
this Summer my life has fallen apart and nowadays I lie in bed all day unless im hanging out with some acquaintances. 

it all started with college. all through college we were told for jobs I had targeted I needed this degree classification and if not they will throw your app in the bin. I was always inside this classification but in my final semester I somehow unjustly missed out by .01 gpa and now I feel worthless. I appealed and appealed and lost most of my money fighting this but to no avail. I can't repeat because my grades are too good but genuinely pretty useless to me now. 

All my friends think I got my target because i always do. I help my mates in their studies and have wrote essays for a few of them to get their GPA up. now I have graduation on friday and Im no way attending it.

on the other side my mother and my friends from my hometown are telling me I'm dumb and being selfish.

My girlfriend has moved to America and I can't stand being away from her. when I tell her my problems she gets mad at me. I was supposed to get a job in America and we could spend our lives together but I don't think I'll even get it or even get a visa if i do...

on top of all of this my baby brother clearly has mental problems and my mother is making no attempt to get him seen too and we fight about this every day.

491,"How recognizing and identifying your emotions can help you get through them, understand yourself better, and communicate in a healthier way.","I know a lot of people struggle with naming and understanding their emotions. Sometimes we don't even realize it! I think if you can recognize your emotions and understand where they are coming from, you can accept them a lot easier. Plus, it also makes it easier to communicate with others, whether by expressing your emotions or by explaining how you're feeling in a healthy way.

[Here is a Feeling Wheel](http://edgeofmyknowledge.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/secondary-emotions_full.jpg?w=1200) that I found using a google image search. It shows some core or primary emotions in the center of the wheel, and then secondary or more complex emotions are further out. Think about what secondary emotions are behind the primary emotions. Sometimes we can name and identify the primary emotions but we don't realize what secondary emotions are also factoring in to the end result of what we're feeling.

Pick an emotion from the center of the wheel that is relatively easy to recognize, like scared. Think about how you recognize that you're scared. Your heart is pounding, your body tenses up, your breathing is faster, and you might feel the urge to run away or to lash out. Now think about what other, more complex emotions could be leading to you feeling scared. Look at the outer edges of the wheel. Maybe you were scared because you had to give a presentation but you didn't know the material very well. So you were also feeling confused, helpless and embarrassed (these are just examples). Picking apart the core emotion can lead to new insights. If you can identify everything that you're feeling, and possibly if one emotion led to another, it can be easier to tackle that with a strategy.

Understanding your emotions can also help you communicate better. Say you're feeling sad and angry at a friend or partner who was supposed to call you but they didn't. Your first reaction might be to confront them and say ""You're making me angry/sad."" This can be bad for a few reasons - it puts them on the defensive and robs you of any responsibility or control over your own emotions. Instead, think about the more complex emotions that underlie sadness and anger. Perhaps you were feeling hurt, lonely and abandoned? You could say, ""I was hurt that you didn't call me because I was feeling especially lonely that night."" The other person does not immediately feel that they are attacked, and you both recognize what you were feeling, and hopefully they validate that feeling.

When communicating, try to use ""I language"" as much as possible, like ""I felt this way when this happened..."" If you need some time to cool down and reflect before you talk to someone about your emotions, don't be afraid to ask for some space first.

I find my communication skills have really increased since I started looking harder at my emotions and really trying to understand where they are coming from. It helps me pinpoint root causes of my ""surface feelings"" like sadness or anger, and it helps me find a more specific strategy to cope with that emotion and to learn from it for next time.",1395886010.0
492,Step 1 - start running,"It seems pretty well documented here that running (and other forms of exercise or activity) can help with depression.   Don't believe me?   Google 'depression and running"".   Of the things that may help with depression, this was the first one I discovered.  Running has taught me that *I* can pull myself out of depression.  I didn't know that anything could help before. 

So given that running is one positive thing I can do to feel better, how do I do it?

I've been running for a little over two years now.   I started out doing it because I was angry at myself and wanted some punishment.   Bad reason, but it got me started. 

After I started, I found a program called C25K (Couch to 5 Kilometers)... see /r/C25K for info and support.   It is a great way to start, you don't have to be a runner to do it. 

I'm an old guy... so I don't run very hard, I run easy, I slow down going uphill, I try not to pound.  Sometimes I walk.  Running is easier for me now than it was when I was in my 20's or 30's.  Maybe I have less to prove. 

I *must* run every other day, or I find myself getting more depressed.  I discovered this the hard way.  Sometimes I take two days off, but more than that and things get bad fast.   So I'm motivated.   I usually get three runs a week, ten to twelve runs a month, around 38-42 minutes each. 

Here is the most important step:  Going out the door is the hardest portion of the run.  Once I step out of the door, I'm already a winner.

Today, I have a new (better) job, a new (better) boyfriend, very few kidney problems (I'm drinking more tea lol), and I have switched to a medication called Pristiq (an SNRI instead of an SSRI). Most important of all though, I haven't had more than a fleeting suicidal thought in over 2 months. I decided to retake the test to see where I was at...and scored a 24. 

I'm not sure if it was the change in medication, the change in lifestyle, or the turn of events, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that life does get better, and we all have the power to change that.

My first assignment was to keep a diary where I talk about my sleep, drug/alcohol intake, activities, and mood. I'm supposed to rate my mood on a scale from 1 (not depressed) to 10 (most depressed) every day, but I've had trouble doing that so mostly I just describe how I feel.

I have an addictive, depressive and anxious personality. It took me years, but I finally managed my depression with regular exercise. I use medication too, but who really knows if that does anything?   
Life was easy while I was studying. It became harder during full time work, but just regular people hard, not real hard, like for example, losing a loved one, going broke, having a bad accident etc.   
This is one of the things I truly hate about myself. No matter what kind of awesome situation I am in, I am never happy. The only times I feel really happy is if I am wrapped up in others' assurance and love, or if I see my family members happy. I know we're not meant to feel jubilant all the time, but if I didn't have a decent family, like if it was just me against the world, I don't think I'd have allowed myself to live this long. There is determination and stubbornness in me, just enough.  I have a good sense of humour and I really try to use it to brighten situations, but as soon as there's no need to cheer up a friend or defuse an awkward social situation, I'm back to being internally miserable. There are some days where things work out well and I barely worry and I feel like 'hey, this is fun. I really appreciate the opportunities at my fingertips etc'. I feel like my depression and anxiety are a sieve and those happy feelings are very fine powder, just slipping straight through.  


 I hate how selfish I am. I wouldn't say I'm the most selfish person I know, but I know in my heart that more selflessness would help me feel more content, help me escape from my own cluster F brain and benefit my family. I have this bad habit though, of making myself out to be the victim and getting assurance and forgiveness by being vulnerable. I think this is a product of my upbringing (which wasn't bad at all) and I am struggling to figure out how I change it. I am very transparent and happy to talk about my issues, maybe a little too much. I'm always trying to reason why I did this and why I felt that. I'm always planning to improve myself and change, but every time it's happy-happy-joy-joy planning and list writing that fizzles out after a few days. I always look to my partner to cheer for me on the sidelines with these kinds of positive life changes. I know that it is not their job, but I rely on their interest to stay motivated. I can't stay committed or motivated very long at all. Then I start hating on myself or picking at my partner's faults, or giving my partner elaborate plans for their self-improvement that they MUST do NOW. Then I realise how selfish, forceful and mean I'm being and sincerely apologise. And feel guilty and just an awful person all round. Then I vow to change.   


For a while, I was listening to Christian podcasts. I liked the way they encouraged me to look outside myself and find fulfillment in helping others. I wasn't so keen on a lot of the Bible references etc..., but the general values were encouraging. It made me wish I grew up in a religious family. Like, the threat of going to Hell is a pretty good way of making people generally do the right thing. I'm not saying it's the perfect remedy, but obviously there's plenty of stuff that helps guide people in a 'meaningful' way. So, I'm thinking I might start listening to them again. Either that, or listen to some self-help podcasts for becoming a more selfless and independent person.",1602760060.0
510,"We spent the last year trying to make cognitive behavioural therapy as easy and accessible as possible, here’s what we came up with","*This may be of interest to anyone who has had or is having cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).*

We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT.

We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing. 

Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like. 

Two things happened that we are pleased with:

1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions. 
2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy. 

Right now we’re really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We’d be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible. 

It's available on iOS and android and you can get it at ionamind dot com.",1599680296.0
511,"No matter how hard I try, I keep feeling like a failure."," I’m about to be 30 soon, and life hasn’t really taken off for me. This pandemic period, while being a pause button for everyone, is like everyday life for me. I’m unemployed, still financially dependent on my parents and can’t seem to do anything right, even the things I’m supposed to do.

I had an alright job at 25, but I quit that to pursue my dream of becoming an academic. Academia has been my first love, and the only time I stop thinking about the misfortune that is my life is when I’m researching or writing papers. My parents are essentially the greatest people anyone can find on earth. They supported me when I decided to do another Masters degree, which I thought would boost my chances of getting into a decent PhD programme. I got into a decent PhD programme, but I could not get any funding because my grades are not good enough. Almost everyone there has funding, but me. At this point I just feel like the most useless person in the world. I wasted money on an extra masters that did not help me with what I wanted, and now my parents insist on paying for my first year (out of three) of PhD till I can get a part time job to manage the rest, because they share my dream and know that I love it. They have already sacrificed so much for me, and they are more than happy to do more, which makes me feel extremely guilty.

Being self-funded has been a blow, where I feel and keep reading online that I am not supposed to be doing a PhD, that self-funding is just a polite rejection of your intellect. More importantly, I have this crushing feeling that I will never be able to be an academic and do research in the field that I love. I hate myself for being so ambitious and yet so dumb. And when I look around for an alternative, there is none, because I cannot imagine doing anything else other than studying and working on my discipline in an academic capacity. I sit on my ass all day, looking at friends and acquaintances who are well settled in life and have got everything together, with the only inconvenience in their lives being that they were unable to watch a movie or buy a game.

How are you supposed to connect with people and make new friendships when it feels like everyone else can be happy, except you?? when it feels like everyone else has friends and life experience to talk about, except you?  I completely get that everyone has their own demons, but exposing those kind of vulnerabilities isn't exactly appropriate when trying to forge new relationships in the first place.

I feel cripplingly lonely and unsurprisingly completely apathetic about my life. I'm slowly realising that life without human connection isn't worth it. However, attaining the very thing that would lift my depression is made virtually impossible because of that depression. I don't have any friends to accompany me to clubs/meetups etc. to lesson the pressure on me so that's also out of the question :/

does anyone have any advice to get through this? I have been trying to make myself happy first and developing a sense of identity through trying new things. I've been finding keeping up the motivation to do this really draining. It feels so forced. is this just an excuse for me to continue isolating myself?

I haven’t gone outside all day or done anything productive or for fun (Nothing makes me happy any more, just causes thoughts that I’m wasting time and/or more negative self-comparisons).

518,I'm going back to therapy tomorrow,"Recently, my mental health has truly gone to shit. I wrote a post a few days ago venting about my situation, but in a few words, I'm working on finishing my law degree and have to take an oral exam at the end of the year for which I've been prepping since february, and the best way to describe it is that it is like being in finals week every single week for at least eight months. I have interrogations (which are basically mock exams) every week, and even though I've been doing well in them and developing a pretty steady study method, as time has gone by, my stress levels have only gone up. I cry at least once a day, I have trouble sleeping, my heart rate is up even if I'm just sitting down studying, I frequently wake up with panic attacks, and I just feel a general sense of dread and guilt most of the time. 
A while ago (and I actually wrote about it here) I went to see a therapist and did not click with her at all. I have seen a couple therapists before and had never interacted with one that felt less empathetic than her. During the session I mentioned to her how I had a hard time talking to my parents about how I was feeling, because their usual response would be to say I should ""just relax"" and her response was ""well, that's actually good advice"", which, even as I'm writing this, I can't believe was something a therapist told me while I was sobbing in front of her. I was really unmotivated to continue therapy after that, but I did go to see a doctor under her advice, to have exams taken to see if any of my symptoms had causes other than stress and anxiety. All my exams came back completely normal, so under my doctor's advice, I changed my contraception (from the pill to Nuvaring) and started taking anti anxiety medication. I started doing both things at the same time, so I'm not sure which of them had more of an effect, but right away, I noticed a significant drop in all of the physical symptoms I was feeling before, and due to that, my mental health started improving. 
That was until about two and half weeks ago, when I started to feel bad again. At first, it was little by little, but now I feel like I'm pretty much back at square one. I've continued taking my medication daily, I meditate and I generally try to be aware of my negative thoughts constantly and to steer my mind away from them, but I just feel like I keep pushing a boulder down a mountain, and it keeps rolling down on me. 
I feel like I'm not doing enough, I feel weak for needing to take so much time out of my day just to calm myself down, or talk myself out of a negative thought spiral. I feel guilty because even though I am in a stressful situation, I know I'm so privileged to be able to get a degree from a good university and to not have to worry about supporting myself while studying because I've got my parent's support. 
Right now the only person I talk honestly about this to is my boyfriend, and I feel completely reliant on him. And while we're really close and enjoy spending time together, I hate that all that I'm going through has made me so clingy and dependant on him.

I've viewed society, humanity, and the world as irrecoverably broken, miserable, unjust, and hopeless for over half my life now, and it's seeped into my 24/7 state of being.  I view every stranger as ""How have they been sexually harassed/racially profiled"", every news story as ""Further proof of the hopeless pit that makes life not worth living for all of us now"", and every negative media review as ""Unable to enjoy anything/proof that art and passion are dead and hopeless"".  Jokes about depression, hopelessness, self-esteem, etc, also all make me just as sad.  There's no outlet or relief when everything's negative. Therapy, yoga, and meditation aren't helping either.

I am also a boyscout, one rank away from eagle. I have done many things, including becoming a PADI scuba certified diver, And I have a loving family, but I don’t always get too much support in the ways I feel I need 


This might sound like I have a lot going for me, which I do, but behind this life of what looks very normal, I struggle with a vaping addiction, social anxiety, adhd (despite having a high iq), and drug abuse issues (dxm, dph, marijuana)

I feel like I am not running as fast as I want to, and I know I can run faster, and farther, but my vaping addiction does not allow me to get as much oxygen that I need to my legs. 
My times for the 800 are 2:20.4 as my pr, but I am physically able to get down to 2:07 and under. 
If I quit, I would be able to go faster, but as many know, nicotine is a demon that holds you in it’s talons. My parents are trying to help me with it by giving me nicotine gum, but that only does so much, and every few days, I can’t stand it, and take a few more hits

The rest of my problems such as the occasional use of dxm to feel less depressed, do not help me and I realize that. 
The dph, aka Benadryl is For sleep, as I have insomnia, and I can barely sleep without it, waking up every 30 minutes, in a sweat

The weed, is nearly every day, up until last week, when I decided to slow down. I only used it when I’m with friends, and in school. That has slowed down from being every day to being every three or so days. The longest break I have taken in the last month was a week and a half, which has helped a lot in moving away from it

The drugs hold me back from pushing myself towards my goals grade wise, and I am waning myself off of them to get to gaining my motivation for my betterment. Any tips on quitting anything, and getting me out of a depressed mindset would be very insightful, and I would thank you eternally

Moreover, during class, I am a good student when I am not “fucked up” far beyond my peers, from handing in assignments very early, and finishing tests with an 89% accuracy in 2/3 to 3/4 of the time others finish

I next to never do homework at home as I am almost always cooped up in my room feeling like shit, and often times crying. Methods to focus on my work would help greatly

My parents always tell me to look at how well I am doing, but they have no idea the extent of my anxiety and my drug abuse. They only know about the vaping and marijuana as far as I know, and I would have the hardest time trying to ask for help with the other things. 

Every time I bring up how I am feeling, they shoot it down, and my mother doesn’t want to accept the fact her son is depressed, and has adhd. She doesn’t want me medicated, or put on antidepressants, since she gets paranoid about medication. She is the closest thing to anti medicine as an antivaxxer is to vaccines 

My father on the other hand wants me to get medicine, and go to therapy, but my mother is the rule of the house, and she doesn’t want me even going to therapy. 

I am ready to drop the Bomb on her about her use of my father’s Xanax prescription that he forgot about long ago, and the time I found my pot in her bedside drawer, nearly used completely up, as well as a vape pen which I nor my sister ordered right next to it.

**My main symptoms of depression:**

* constant exhaustion no matter how much sleep I get
* mind fog and general lack of ability to focus
* circling thoughts, I generally fixate on existential things as well as gender issues
* ennui and anhedonia

I'm still in the early stages with this medication, so I'm just starting to feel the effects, but here goes.

**Positives:**

* I AM SO AWAKE NOW
* Focus and awareness has greatly improved. These first two have honestly been the biggest and most significant change.
* I still ponder the universe but I can generally turn things off more easily
* I generally feel less hopeless about things and my mood is more stable.
* My restless leg seems to have calmed down. Not sure what that's about, but I'll take it!

**Negatives:**

* I AM SO AWAKE NOW EVEN AT 4AM. I have to assume this is going to catch up with me at some point.
* I feel sort of... nauseous most of the day, especially right after taking it. It's not terrible, it's just a niggling little thing.
* Loss of appetite (this might be a plus for some people). I'm already lower than I'd like and I'm trying to gain muscle, but food just looks... entirely unappetizing (also I'm nauseous a lot).
* I've been feeling sort of dissociative. I'm not sure if it's because I can focus on things more easily and tune out other stuff or what. It's hard to describe, but I feel sort of weird and out of sync sometimes.

Overall, I'm feeling pretty good about the ways things are going so far. I think the positives are outweighing the negatives at least.

528,How do I stop living like and overgrown child?,"This is gonna be a pretty big ramble, so I apologise in advance, and applaud you if you read it all. I’m basically venting

So here’s a little backstory for you all.

I’m 25 and male living in the uk

November last year gf of 4 years broke up with me, sank into a huge depression which culminated in me trying to hang myself at the end of January, thankfully it didn’t work and I stayed in a mental health ward for a month, it’s been nearly 4 months since I came out of hospital, and I’ve had the help of a crisis team and my regular CBT therapist to help get me back into a state where I was able to function a bit better day to day. I generally feel a lot better than I did before. I’m over my ex in the sense that I’m no longer emotionally attached to her in any way, but the idea of it still has comes with some trauma.

My problem is that recently I’ve been feeling like I’m an overgrown child, that I’m emotionally immature, lonely, needy, have no ability to sacrifice the present for the future, have countless bad habits, impatient, lazy, procrastinate way too much, self critical and self destructive, and so on and so on. And it’s making me feel for one like I’m some kind of messed up hopeless misfit of an individual, and that any substantial changes to make me a better and more well rounded person is one that’s gonna take longer than I could bare.

My days are in no way as miserable as they were till January, in general they are okay, nothing exceptional either way, lots of ups and downs throughout the day but ultimately okay. But I keep getting days, about once maybe twice a week, where everything seems incredibly hopeless and bleak and impossible to change.  

What I consider my biggest grievance, is that I’m chronically lonely, the only real consistency in the bad days is that there isn’t anyone for me to talk to. I don’t mean that, because I’ve got no one to talk to I feel bad, just that when I feel bad, and I’ve got no one to talk to I feel worse.

My friends have been great in accommodating me over the last few months and helping and being there for me, two in particular have been amazing, I meet up with them separately about once maybe twice a week and we have a little catch up on how my week has been, and how I’ve been feeling. But obviously, they can’t be around 100% of the time and I understand that. It’s mainly an terrible coincidence that when Something brings me to a low point, no one is around to talk to about it, and I’ll spend the day alone and trapped in my head.

Now the thing that’s been plaguing my mind for the last couple days as well as on and off for a little bit, is that I feel like, generally, I’m in a place good enough for me to put myself back into the dating world, or at least allow myself the possibility of something happening, like using tinder for example, not actively searching for anything, but ya know, allowing the possibility for it to happen. 

Now the problem is, I’m riddled with insecurities, and perceived inadequacy, and every perceived “rejection” and I use that term very loosely, kinda scrambles my mood, brings me down and all the rest. Now, I’m not an unattractive man, I’m an average looking guy, if not slightly above average. 

But every time I get down and think about my loneliness, I feel so riddled with little problems, that it feels like regardless of if I can resolve any of the issues that I have, that there will always be more that need to be fixed. And that I’m never going to find happiness as long as I have these issues to deal with.

I’m watching/reading countless self help videos and motivational things and all that to try and build my self confidence, and it’s worked to a great deal, I asked someone out last night, that I thought I had some chemistry with something I did not think I would be able to do, was on messenger and have had no response yet. But I’m proud I was able to do it. But again the silence on their part has made my day pretty hellish.

Okay I’m done, guess this is more of a vent rather than a question, but if anyone has any advice or anything that would also be cool.

529,Friends suicide is making me feel worthless. I regret not driving to his place. I had no idea he'd do something like this.,"So a really good friend of mine that I knew for 10 years committed suicide on the 26th of December of 2017. This has made me feel very insecure and almost depressed. He lived 40+ minutes away from me. But the thing is he told me that we will go to Arizona to check out a school there. And we were supposed to hang out on Thursday the 28th. But I have no idea what caused him to take his life. I got the call from his aunt at 11pm on that Tuesday as I was going to bed that he is in the hospital. And my mom came in my room later and told me that his mom told her that he hung himself. I did not talk to face to face or see him that day. But earlier that day he uploaded a Snapchat video of him watching Lord of The Rings on a Macbook Pro with an E-Cigarette in his hand aka a Juul. And the regret I already have is why did I not go to his house that day? That's what is bothering me about my friends death the most. Is that I wish I asked him if he wants to hang out with me on that day. But I had no idea that he was gonna do this because there were no warning signs or I did not get any feelings that he was gonna do this. But he smoked weed alot and I heard later that he took XANAX(anti-anxiety pill) and mixed it with weed and painkillers and meth(my mom told me my friend had a cocktail of drugs in his system). But I am not sure if that was the cause of his death. I asked my Parents and Friends about why do I have such a regret of not reaching out to my friend that day because I wish I reached out to him and ask ""Hey wanna hang out and skate?"" or something? But they keep telling me to not have such regrets and there was no way that I was going to prevent my friends suicide. Why do I keep feeling guilty? I miss my friend. And I wish he was still here physically. But I heard he had depression and he never told me that he actually had depression. I miss my friend and I want him to be physically here again. What do I do? On the Monday(1 day earlier) that I saw him he was completely normal I did not notice anything strange in him his suicide just completely caught me by surprise. The 25th of December of 2017 is the last time I saw my friend. The thing I am trying to figure out is why he would do such a thing and not think about his friends? Cause I miss my friend so much. I wish I talked to him on the day he killed himself but then again I had no idea that he had depression or was planning suicide. But still I can only imagine if he would've been alive if I asked him on text if he wants to hang out. My friends suicide has been tormenting me and I keep asking myself why did he take his own life? I really wish I called him up but my other friend tried to call him but he did not respond to his phone call on the day he killed himself. I have been struggling to focus in class. I keep thinking about him day and night 24/7. The thing I miss the most is hanging out with him and skating. I wish I attempted to call him up that day and it's haunting me. I've been struggling to have a piece of mind because of this. Please help. Any useful advice? I miss my friend. His decision to end his life just completely sent shockwaves through my body. And lately I've just been trapped in this constant loop of why did I not drive to his house that day? The thing is on Snapchat that day me and my friends (including the one who ended his life later that day). We wanted to go go-karting but then one of my other friends said that they were busy. But I said that I am free and my friend(who ended his life later that day). Then said ""If we can't hang out today then let's hang out on thursday."" and I said ok. I thought to myself, ok, we'll see each other on Thursday and then I went to go workout at the beach. But then that phone call came at 11pm and it still haunts me to this day. But the autopsy shows that my friend like how I said before had (XANAX, Painkillers, heavy doses of Weed, and Crystal Meth in his system). I am not sure if that caused a negative reaction and caused him to have negative thoughts and then end his own life. But going back. I wish I would've driven down to his house and hung out with him maybe he would still be alive today I am not sure. I am not a fortune teller. But my friend who ended his life also told me like 4 weeks ago that there are days where he just wants to be by himself. I did not see any warning signs or red flags that this was going to happen. I wish I could talk to him face to face if I only knew he would do something like this. I feel lost and hopeless in my life without my friend.

530,"I’ve been procrastinating on starting a project for six months due to depression, and today I’m going to have an honest discussion with my supervisor about it","There’s a lot that I regret about the past six months. I’d consistently picked the short-term gratification of youtube and video games over doing the work I had been assigned. It’s not paid work, and it’s just a side project for my supervising professor, but it was follow-up from (paid) work I’d done for him last summer so it really was entire my responsibility.

In 15min I have a meeting with my supervisor. I’m absolutely terrified, because I’m going to him after 6 months with nothing to show for it. But I’m going to apologize and be honest and take responsibility for my mistakes. If he’s angry or upset that’s completely justified, and I’ll fully accept it. I want to take this as a learning opportunity about communication skills, honesty, and what jobs I can or can’t handle. I’m probably going to cry at some point but I’ll try my best not to.

This really sucks and I don’t want to do this but I know that I’ll never be able to move on or change myself without confronting reality and the consequences of my decisions. I can’t keep wallowing in my failures forever. And I know that no matter how badly I’ve screwed up here, I can make up for it if I can work harder in the future. In 5 or 10 years I’ll probably look back at this and laugh about how much of an idiot I was, and the thought that future me will be able to move past this fills me with a lot of hope and determination.

I’m also going to get myself to a counsellor or therapist ASAP, because I’ve realized through this experience that I sorely need one.

Thanks for reading my rant, and I’ll update after the meeting. I’m really just posting this for myself, so I can read this after the meeting and remind myself why I did it. Thanks again.

EDIT/UPDATE: It went.... really really well, you guys ;_; it's been a while since I've seen him, so he asked me how my situation was going and I got instantly teary-eyed haha.... He opened up to me about his own family troubles (since that's mostly what's been plaguing me), and comforted me a lot, he went and told a lot of stories (he does that a lot and it's great), we talked about the upcoming school year and he was excited to hear that I wanted to take one of his classes! He wasn't angry with me at ALL, he's one of the people who values honesty above everything else but I'm always shocked at how patient he is with me. He told me at one point during his stories that he thinks he's really lucky, to have met his wife and also to have someone like me as his student... I don't know what I did to deserve such a kind and understanding supervisor... Past me must've made a *super* good impression on him or something. I did make a point to tell him that I was so sorry to let my personal problems affect his projects, that I knew it wasn't fair to him, and that I was super grateful for his patience.

I have another meeting with him on Tuesday, and I am **absolutely determined** to make the most of the next 3 days and get this project as finished and polished as possible. Wish me luck everyone, and thanks again for hearing me out.",1525465223.0
531,"25, almost 26, not had a job before (ever), mental health problems exacerbated the problem/the problem's exacerbated mental health issues.","I don't really know what to do. I had a troubled adolescence, missed out on basic qualifications like science and IT, went to college at 16 and got three great A-Levels in the humanities and got a ""scholarship"" to go to university (£1k bursary a year, for three years, as long as I attained >55% which I fucked up almost instantly), which I dropped out of far too late to make up for it (I'm British, so I fucked up my loan allocations). 

I've been living with my partner for the past five years, and this has barred me from most benefits. A combination of the severity of my mental health problems (anxiety/depression, avoidant type) has made it very hard for me to reach out on my own, and my boyfriend's found it stressful trying to find help for himself and me, wherein he became, essentially, my carer.

I've lived a horrible cycle of hating myself, hating my body and the way I look, finding it embarrassing moving forward and even applying for work when I look at my very bare CV and worry about being judged for the way I look on top of how poor my CV reads. It doesn't help that I won't do a job that I feel is unconscionable (which is a lot of the jobs for people in my position e.g. telesales) or I'm not actually good at (most public service roles, I don't have the energy to project an eternally bright and smiley outlook). I also won't lie on my CV. 

Ironically, I know how capable I am if I'm given the opportunity, but living in a country that is predominantly service based and where jobs appear to go to people as much because of who they know, rather than what they know, I'm not sure how I can compete. Living with chronic suicidal ideation probably doesn't help there.

I know I need to 'see someone' but in this climate it's hard. I tried, repeatedly, to see someone whilst living with my boyfriend - most overlooked my needs because it was easier for them, and virtue-signal and blame the funding crisis for why I'm not able to get more practical help (i.e. longer term contact with MHS, not necessarily 'active engagement' but a point of contact who I can get a reference for work from etc. as well as self-help groups and access to meaningful physical exercise a week, all of which one way or another WAS available but I wasn't referred to because my psychologist was a lazy fucking arsehole and if you're told that it's not available and want to trust people out of benevolence and deference to their profession, then you might not realise until after and it's too late and you can't be fucked going on the merry-go-round of referrals again...).

Sorry for the long-winded rant, like I said avoidant so will only reply to PMs likely enough. Sorry for missing details/confusing narrative, five years is a long time to ruminate and frankly I cry every time I try and put this into words which again, not helpful to move onwards and upwards towards better health.


Oh, and I'm not interested in volunteering unless anyone knows of any very short-term but CV boosting activities that requires little experience and ideally I can do online. I volunteered for several charities, one as a mentor for teenagers who were being bullied and had zero support and failed in my role because of complete lack of volunteer management, and I volunteered casually at a charity shop for about a year and a half, which I hated because I like using my brain and that sort of work leaves me bored and prone to smoking the shift away. A lot of other enquiries failed due to the lack of professionalism of the volunteer managers, so I think I'm probably too critical a person to really succeed as a volunteer until I have some sort of skill to actually volunteer my time with.

532,Just broke out of a depression,"I recently had a breakthrough after another steep 4 month decline into a reoccurring depression. What I learned that helped me is stupid simple in retrospect and while it may not help everyone I realize, it may help some so I feel a strong need to give back.

I broke out of my depression through the realization that, while I believe life is indeed meaningless, it doesn't need to be empty. If we showed up on this rock by accident then shit, why not make the most of it? Instead of focusing on everything wrong with me, my life, and how indomitable and hopeless some of worlds problems may seem to be, I am focusing instead on personal experiences. Challenging myself to **stay** outside of my comfort zone, and doing things that cause me anxiety normally (that I avoid like the plague when depressed).

I believe that when we get stagnant it can lead to depression and for parts of our brains to shrink. Something as simple as striking up a conversation with someone new (even when you want to do anything but talk to someone and you have to fake it), going home a different way from work, riding a roller coaster, etc. - anything to change your routine, new experience, or challenge to yourself will put you one step closer to breaking out.

Here are resources that have really helped me reach this point in the order I would recommend intaking:

533,How do I stop hating myself and how do I let go of my past?,"I hate myself, I really do.  I've hated myself since middle school and it continues to this day.  I'm 25 now and I think about how nice it would be to purge myself of all my memories and start fresh.

On paper I'm really not a bad guy and there are plenty of people who say really nice things about me.  But I can't let go of this lingering feeling that I am a terrible person.  I've done things in the past that I regret, and I've retaliated against people that have hurt me with 10 times the intensity of what they did to me.  

I don't know how to let go of all this anger and hate I have inside of me.  There are times when I don't think about things and then it hits me in a big wave and once it's in my head it's near impossible to shake.  I relive my memories, it feels like I'm back there desperately trying to change the outcome.

I don't want to be this negative person, I don't want to look into someone's eyes and see every moment I've ever failed them.  I want to be able to do everything that I can to make things better here and now rather than think about how great things could have been had I made better choices.

I can tell the difference between a good and a bad day but my emotions don't really extend beyond that. I travelled alone to lots of new places for a few months, I felt nothing. I came back to the city where I live, nothing. Going back home to visit my parents, nothing. Graduating, nothing. I can't say I'm not happy because I probably am. But I don't really feel it.

535,"Marriage is over, anxiety attacks start","My wife and I were married for 4 years and together for almost 10 when last week I approached her to talk saying that she was emotionally distant with me and that I felt that she was not working on our partnership very hard. That was when she told me she was not happy and wanting to move on. We had an event happen over 2 years ago that damaged our relationship and I worked hard to take corrective action to not cause more pain. I have learned this week that she has been thinking of leaving me for the last year and had talked to a couple friends about it at her job. 

She asked for space last week and was aggressively going after her crush, who was also her boss until 3 weeks ago, who is also our next door neighbor in the condo units that we live in (I'm talking we share a wall with the guy). I worked hard on giving her space and giving her some time to figure things out but I also had questions and wanted to talk. Needless to say, it seems I pushed too hard and she started looking for places to move into for December 1st. 

We had a very harsh conversation 2 days ago and we talked again yesterday. I felt it was a very clear and well done conversation, allowing us to voice our concerns, pain, and deal with these items. I asked her to not lie to me if she was going to hang out with this guy as she made the comment of ""I'm going out to hang out with some people"". Later on, I sent her a text message, requesting that while she was looking for a place, she keep the relationship with said guy friendly and not romantic for the time being so that we could both feel comfortable and safe in this situation. I heard nothing back from her.

Last night was a Halloween party. When I got home, I found that his truck was parked in his space and upon entering my place, found that she was not home. I knew that she was going out with him to a different event so I figured they were cabbing home. When I got up this morning, she was not there. I called her and asked her where she was and she told me she was still out. I asked her if she was over at his place and she said yes. I told her to come get her things and to get out. When she arrived, she would not talk to me. She worked on getting her clothes together so she could leave. I asked her, pleaded with her actually, to stop and listen so I could explain my pain to her.

The only comment that I received from her was ""you are demanding me these things"". I am working hard so that this marriage can end peacefully and we can go our separate ways from each other but it has been very painful this last week with the guilt I feel, the pain from the loss, and the anxiety that has come over me. I have found resources in the city this week to help me out and had to call the help line this morning to get some aid with talking me down from my anxiety attack.

The worst pain that I feel is knowing she was with him last night and that she lied about it.",1477851291.0
536,How do I snap out of apathy I developed to deal with depression,"Hi,

I had been quite sad and depressed for couple of past years..as a way to deal with my situation I started to shut myself out...trying not to feel anything...Well it worked, now I do not feel sad, depressed, heart broken or fearful...but lately I do not really feel anything, I feel like I have gotten myself high on something, I have become too lax, apathetic and reckless. I do not think about the consequences of anything, nothing really matters, I have become quite lazy as well.
Its not that I feel bad or sad. I just feel chill and calm.

The biggest issue this lax attitude is causing is that its effecting my performance at work. There are important issues to be dealt with, but I do not feel the need to address them. I do not feel motivation to start something new or to improve some current task. I'm a recently promoted team lead(just couple of months ago I got it) but I do not feel any drive in me to live up to expectations of managers. I used to be really innovative and responsible in my job but now I do not feel the need to do such things. Doing work properly used to make me happy, but now I do not feel the need for anything or anyone to make me feel happy or anything... If I put my feeling aside, just use my head I do realize that I need to pull myself together and behave responsibly but I can not really bring myself to do it. I do not even wake up for the office in the morning, I go to office in after noon...sometimes I think I need to just resign before they fire me....but what would I do after resigning...?!, only thing I can do is pull my act together but I do not know how to do it

FYI, I had not taken any medicines for depression. I just suffered through it and then learned to change my attitude towards things.

You must have noticed I did not mention anything about my relationships...well, I have cut them off with every one, I have isolated myself, I just talk to people about professional matters or important stuff. I know I should do a little bit of socializing, but my life is finally peaceful, I want it to stay this way for a while, and I do not feel that confident about socializing, I feel like if I get hurt like before I won't be able to bear it.",1476475459.0
537,Motivational Monday- Don't 'should' on yourself and common trigger words.,"I was once given a list of all commonly used would that caused people with depression to experience *more* depression. Of course, I couldn't find that list.

Anyway, one of the biggest ones is “should”. The slightly goofy saying 'don't should all over yourself' has a lot of merit. Often, we will use should as a way to berate ourselves for what we think is a given. Somehow, we therefore fall short and see ourselves as less than as a result.  

The point of trying to rid your life of the automatic 'should' is to find where the assumption is and how it is being used to undermine your self-worth. For instance, 'I should be making more money'.  Maybe not terrible in and of itself, but it can easily be used  as fodder for feeling shitty about yourself. 'I should be making more money... but I don't. I must not be very useful. I must not be worth much.'

Realistically, it could be that your current career simply doesn't pay well. It could be that the job you're currently at is greatly underpaying you for your work. However, by jumping into negative speculation without exploring neutral and potentially helpful reasons, you're shooting yourself in the foot. 

Another one I find troublesome is “can't even”. I heard it growing up and it always stung. 'I can't even get the beginning of this paper started.' Why I find it particularly harmful is because it is great at completely disregarding all of things you've done and learned in life due to one event. A more useful replacement would probably be 'I'm having difficulties with X” There's probably a reason why. Maybe you're not disciplined enough. Maybe you're thinking too much about something that matters very little. 

There a handful of very powerful little words that line up a domino effect of negative thoughts. If you have any, please feel free to add to the list. You really should. ;) ",1476075667.0

And he was right. Granted, I started only two days ago but I'm already feeling the improvement. Everything feels better already. I feel better.

Until recently I thought it was just something I would overcome, but lately I have accepted that is not how it works.  

It's more like when an alcoholic says they're an alcoholic even though they haven't had a drink in 20 years.  You can still have depression even if you haven't been sad/angry in years. It's just a matter of managing it well. I find this realization oddly comforting. I guess it makes me feel less guilty for being sad, and makes me hopeful that, even though I will always have this, I will continue to develop ways of managing it. Running and exposing myself to positive thoughts helps.

541,Build Love,"Build love. I laughed at the man who said that to me. I laughed until I heard it echo off the jagged walls of my cold empty cave as I sat in the dark with my most loyal life companion, No One. No One wrapped his arms around me and held me in a deep embrace, like no human ever has, soothing me in places no human has ever reached. We are together again at our demented tea party, laughing arrogantly as the sweet lumps of judgment dissolve in our hot cups of pain.

Some might question the company I keep; No One seems ugly to others. Secretly I have always felt slightly more evolved as the only one who can see his true beauty. I look at his soft shape and he is so dear to me, as my oldest friend. Stitched together, a patchwork of those who shaped my fears, his voice a broken recording of things I can never unhear. We look at the world with unforgiving eyes and each time we dissect something until it becomes ugly we become closer as our hearts melt together a little more. He is the only one who has ever felt safe to me.

Build love? Love should just appear, as a magical burst that comes straight out of no where! Just as I expected to move 3,000 miles away and start my life over smoothly as if my past suffering were some form of currency with which I could buy immunity from the trials of life. Without the universe forcing me mercilessly to inconceivable lows then even lower to teach me that pain is actually a bottomless, infinite abyss and the only thing that can pull you up from the depths is your own fucking spirit. Just as I expected to somehow become a masterful artist in a short span of time where it took others a lifetime of dedication. Just as I marked on my calendar the appropriate date when my wounds should be healed from things that clawed their way through my skin and feasted on my soul like it was a Sizzler buffet. Just as I lived my way straight out of really living in life and walled myself into this cave with No One.

Build love. Me and No One, we destroy shit. We dissect everything; we take things apart before we even have to experience them because we are so clever that we can see exactly what they are all about and how they will end. And when we have finally figured out the final move in the scenario we didn’t participate in, we march around our empty cave in darkness with our heads held high, celebrating our cleverness at having outsmarted life and feeling superior to the ignorant people who are foolish enough to actually experience things.

Build love. I thought about this as I sat in my cave on the pile of a lifetime of leftover scraps I was given that I didn’t build love from. I looked at all of them again. None of them were good enough, they weren’t my idea of how I thought they should be, they seemed strange or foreign, they didn’t fit my abstract plan, they made me nervous, they just weren’t right somehow. Maybe they were real, but they were not magical by my narrow definition. They weren’t my personal idea of perfect. So I threw them away without ever thinking to polish them or paint them or added fucking anything at all of myself to them. Or even just to engage in an activity of creation of any type with them because that is just the natural flow of life. I never considered I had the power to make them what I needed them to be, that perfection could stem from the simple act of adding something of my own to them. Instead I imagined what someone else would build with them and shut down the plans when it fell short of my vivid imaginings.

Build love. As if it were a structure. An actual refuge you could dwell in, not just something that would fade as you get close as you realize it was just an apparition made by heat on the horizon. Something you could patch and repair and expand to suit the needs of your soul, if only you would participate in its construction.

Build love. It is much more intellectual, I always thought, to be clever enough to see the worst in everything. To always be a step ahead of living the moment. To see the tragic ending, to live out the twists and turns and endings in my mind, saving myself from the experience. I did not build love. I built a world of such solitude only I could understand its complexity and lurk in it comfortably. Me and No One.

Build love. How foolish. Isolation… that’s intellectually evolved. When you can think your way out of all the beauty you see and you are smart enough to pour ice cold water on the tiny embers that begin to light up your heart, you are truly a master of your emotions. When you can talk yourself out of all your heart wants to experience with your suspicious thoughts, and warning signs, and you inhale deeply, getting high on the poisonous fumes of judgment- you are truly smarter than those ignorant fools who dare to go on adventures of the heart.

Build love. We laughed at the man who said this, and we sent him on his way as we tore him into pieces until he became something to hide from, and so smartly decided you can love the message without loving the messenger. And we embraced as we always do. Me and No One. We destroy shit.

I saw three therapists but never really let them help me.  I bullshitted them.  I saw a psychiatrist but never let the medications really have enough time to work before stopping taking them.  About a year ago I decided to stop seeking help.  My life has tumbled out of control since then.  Long story cut out of how I got here- I am now living 3000 miles away from anyone I know (except one- my boyfriend I live with) and anywhere that accepts the horrible insurance I have through the state I live in.  I barely leave the house.  I am 18 and have no friends or job experience.  I dropped out of college because I was overwhelmed last fall.  My boyfriend is financially and emotionally supporting me.  Unfortunately he works very long hours and I am alone 90% of the day, with nothing to do, no purpose.  I cry everyday.  I feel like a failure.  I am too socially anxious to leave the house or make phone calls or do anything.   I sit on the computer or read- sometimes I will use the gym in my apartment complex.  I feel so alone in a huge city.  Today I went to the gym and got back and had a nervous breakdown because the sun was coming in the huge windows and overwhelmed me.

I want to go back to college and stop living in such overwhelming fear.  I looked up a few psychiatrists but I have yet to make the phone calls.  I will be paying out of pocket for them.

But I can't even muster the energy or focus to do ""fun"" things like play video games, watch movies/shows I like, or bake tasty things.

544,Going to law school was a mistake,"I am 27 and have just started law school at my top choice university in western Canada. I've spent the past 2 years working towards this goal-- writing the LSAT and crafting my entrance essays was incredibly draining, way more than I expected as I was working in forestry deep in the bush for most of each year. I moved away from a small town which had a fantastic community, close friends and a loving partner to do this. My partner and I split up this weekend, mainly due to his concerns about the viability of our relationship now that I have chosen this path. He is also struggling with intense depression and anxiety, and I haven't been able to be the support for him that he needs lately. I have also been a bit of a mess whenever he's been around, because I feel so deeply unhappy at the moment.

Honestly, I've been depressed ever since I got here. I hate living in a city. I love what I am studying, the courses are fascinating and I love to spend time studying, but when I am actually on campus and interacting with my peers I just want to disappear. I don't fit in, and I don't know how to fit in to this city. I'm finding it harder and harder to keep perspective about what the payoff of this whole experience is. I feel so alone. I want to enter into environmental law, but I'm stuck in an urban center without the time or ability to spend time in the forest. I feel like I've completely lost my identity, and I'm only two months in. I'm isolated and I don't know how to interact with city people. My friends care and have been checking in with me, but I'm honestly so embarrassed at how poorly I'm doing after such a short time.",1667194744.0

I shifted completely with who I talked to, and my everyday life in general. While this happened, my self confidence plummeted. I got overwhelming feelings of jealousy and loneliness. I haven't been able to push myself to make a meaningful friendship. there are plenty of people I know that care about me, but lately I've been hiding. I feel so alone. a few days ago band camp started, so I've seen them again. but I hid the whole time. I couldn't bring myself to talk to anyone, even if I know they expected me to. I put on a persona, I felt disconnected, unable to be myself. I find it so hard to build relationships nowadays. all I want is to have good friends and be comfortable with them, but I keep sabotaging myself like this. Now it's my first bday where I truly hope no one acknowledges it. I just have the impulse to hide. I feel so alone.",1660104182.0

I feel like they ruined my life, if I had gone there, then I would be good enough, I would have everything handed to me the way other people have, and everything would be where it is ""supposed"" to be. I did go to a good school, one that in some ways is better than the one I got rejected from, but it wasn't ""elite"", it didn't prove that I was better than other people.

The clarity having a clearly defined task gives you can help a ton, and you can track progress showing growth and allowing you to feel prideful about your accomplishments. 

Another thing thats helped me is preventing myself from thinking too much about an activity, specifically thinking oneself out of doing it. This is way easier than we may think due to thinking things like doing it later, it not being the best use of your time, or something along those lines.

548,How can I keep up my self care as I’m starting a new job?,"My life fell apart last fall and I am finally going back to work. I have spent the time in between doing intensive outpatient therapy, then running and doing a 5k a month ago, working on my health a lot including starting new meds and getting a sleep study and seeing a dentist for the first time in 6 years. I’m eating healthier, gradually losing weight (losing too fast has been bad for my mental health), and working on improving my sleep while I wait to get equipment for my sleep apnea. 

I’m improving a lot of other things too. I’m proud of myself. 

I just started a part time job and I’m scared. I have to wake up early for it and I will probably be eating lunch out on the road a lot as I’ll be driving over half the time. It’s at a nonprofit that deals with some pretty intense public health stuff and while I’m not directly working with clients, it’s still an atmosphere I’ve seen lead to burnout. 

How do I keep taking care of myself and have it still feel positive and not like a chore all the time? I’m really scared to lose my progress I’ve made in sticking to good habits, to gain back the weight I’ve lost, to not get enough sleep, to have the difficult lives of people we are helping get me down. I’m scared to fall back into depression and despair and neglecting my body. 

For anyone who started a new job or made another big change in the middle of recovery, what helped you keep up positive habits for yourself? My default state is to lie in bed for hours and I’m proud of myself for mostly resisting but I’m scared I will succumb to it again.",1650333048.0
549,Learning to trust again after you’ve been hurt is difficult but necessary - isolation only hurts ourselves,"All of us have had the experience of being hurt or feeling betrayed by someone, whether that’s family, friends or in a relationship. We can feel damaged as a result and decide, consciously or unconsciously that being close to other people is dangerous and to protect ourselves we need to keep others at a distance . Doing this doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with you, as human beings we learned to survive by developing aversions to things that hurt us.

The danger is that we lead a life where even with other people around us we lack a sense of intimacy and connection. Noone can see who we really are because we don’t want to reveal our true selves and as a result we feel lost, alone and lack the strength and resilience to face our difficult emotions.  Having someone who practices deep listening massively increases our chances of being able to accept our difficult feelings.

So how do we break down the walls and let other people in? Well, it has to start inside ourselves, by accepting our own vulnerability and getting comfortable with that. We can understand and listen to our pain, understand the roots and listen to it, even smile to it if you’re comfortable. If we can pin down the specific event that led to our way of being, we can choose, if we’re ready, to understand the suffering and ignorance of others that led to our being hurt. We can choose to forgive that person and over time, let go of our resentment.

Then we can look at the ways we choose to withdraw from other people. Is it when someone tries to get close to us? Is it putting on a front, pretending that we’re OK when we’re really not? Is it in a relationship, where we jump to conclusions and get defensive based on our own bad experiences? We can hold these situations in our awareness, smile to them and plant a little flag in them, so that when they come up rather than reacting on autopilot we can stop, breathe and make a conscious choice.

This is a huge amount of work in practice but choosing to let people in is essential to living a happy and fulfilling life. Our experience may have taught us (repeatedly) that other people will hurt you - and at some point you will be hurt again. But living without intimacy is a hard life, living without people knowing the real you is lonely. At some point you have to take a leap of faith and make the conscious decision to open yourself up to people again, even if its scary. Because the sad irony is that when we isolate our true selves from other people, rather than protecting ourselves we hurt ourselves. And you’re a pretty great person, why shouldn’t the world experience that?

I've literally lost the girl I kinda liked to another guy after we lose connection since my anxiety and depression got out of hand. I've literally had to settle for less in college cause I couldn't handle my classes. I've wasted so much money because of impulsively buying stuff to fill that empty void that will never go away. all my friendships are one sided to where I couldn't even get a happy new year from really anyone.

552,"Self-hatred sucks, but you can get the good ending :)","Howdy gamers,

I wanted to post something positive. Over the course of COVID 19 we all spent too long inside our own heads. I've been hating being me for almost 5 years now since 16 yrs old (now 21). When you wake up every day look in the mirror and go ""god your disgusting"" it really takes a toll on your perception of you, ya know. It got so bad that I just didn't want to be me, I'd take down the mirror in my room so i didn't have to look at me and stuff. It never got to the point of hurting myself but if someone offered to transfer my consciousness to anyone in the world randomly I would have done it. Like if it's completely random I could've swapped bodies with Harvey Weinstein but at that point in time I would have taken it instantly.

Recently I got some help from a talking therapy and its started turning around. I woke up one day and said ""wow you look kinda attractive"" and my mind literally couldn't understand that I was positive about me. I was so used to bashing all the imperfections on my person that being positive was weird. So I'm still adjusting to being positive but low key it's actually kinda nice. It takes so much effort to change how you see yourself but it's something that if you talk to someone about it, it'll help so much.

Does anyone else know what self hatred feels like, it sometimes crawls back when I make a silly decision but I can fight it now and not let it consume me. You can get the good ending gamers, we'll help each other to make it happen.",1633899168.0

554,Get out for a regular walk in nature as part of your mental health routine - really paying attention to your surroundings makes a big difference to your wellbeing,"Most of the time walking is a means to get us from A to B and while we’re walking we’re thinking about the task that needs to be done once we get there. We're lost in plans and worries about the future, not noticing how we're feeling or our surroundings. By slowing down and paying attention we can extract joy from something that we do every day.

You can start by focusing internally - slowing down the pace to a couple of steps for your inbreath, a couple of steps for your outbreath. As you’re slowing down you can begin to notice the pressure of your feet on the ground. As you take each step you can feel the pressure begin at the heel of your foot and flow through the sole to toes, then lifting from the heel again. Really focusing on that feeling, noticing the connection with the ground. As you do this you can notice thoughts arrive and leave, not being swept away by those thoughts but smiling to them, accepting them and letting them go, returning our attention to the feeling of walking on the earth. You can feel some gratitude for your feet, being aware of how important they are for getting around. 

Then you can focus your awareness on your surroundings, starting with what you can hear - birdsong, a plane in the sky, the wind in the trees. You can stop for ten breaths and really focus your attention on one thing, for example a tree or a flower. Taking in its shape, size, colour, texture,  everything you can sense - taking some time to pay attention to the exclusion of everything else. After giving it some time, you can return to your walk until something else catches your eye.

When we walk mindfully, we don’t walk to arrive anywhere, we’ve already arrived in the present moment. We don’t even do a walking meditation to make ourselves calm or happy - having goals for meditation tends to get in the way. We walk simply to enjoy each step; to be present with walking, giving ourselves permission to let go of worries about the future and regrets from the past. That being said - there’s lots of evidence to show that walking in nature is very good for our wellbeing, even thinking about nature can relax us and lift our mood.

555,I've always needed medication. Can I get better without it?,"I've needed medication since I was 19 just to be able to function. I'm tired of it. I hate what SSRIs do to me. I tried non-SSRI medication for a couple of years and always ended up feeling anxious and suicidal again. I reluctantly went back on fluoxetine recently. I hate it (because of side effects that worsen my depression in some ways) but I feel like I'm stuck with it because without it I want to harm myself. 

Is there any hope for someone like me getting better without meds? How is it done?",1619604549.0
556,I feel like I'm becoming more toxic,"For some time now I have been supporting my girlfriend through her depression and there are some very good developments. For one, she just started to see a psychiatrist and got some medication. While she's currently unemployed and is not in the right mindset to get a job yet, she also set up her own online business selling her own crafts. I am so proud of her!

On my end however, I think I've been more drained than usual. I love supporting her through her struggles, but I think I haven't been setting my own limits to my capabilities. I often waste so much time wondering why things like this happen to her, and whether or not my relationship has a future.

Over time, this led to me developing more toxic traits. I feel more impatient, more anxious, and also more needy than usual. I feel like I need more love to sustain myself more than ever before and I get upset when it's not met. I am aware of this because I compared my state of mind with my previous relationships. I don't think I've ever felt this way with my exe before.

557,I have spent the last 12 years asking for help and I'm still in hell,"I was in hell before but I thought I could get out on my own, that time would fix things, etc. People say you are not alone and to ask for help. I called a suicide hotline a few times. The times I managed to control the crying and actually talk, I realize they were just there to basically stay on the line and hear me cry. How great. Except not. I don't want people to hear me cry. They literally told me if that is not enough I can hang up. I'm not blowing off steam, I literally need actual help of some sort. I went to doctors. They were all completely useless. Worse than useless. Therapy is a complete waste of time. All I got from anti-depressives was erectile dysfunction; not that it matters that much seeing as I have nobody. All I got from the anti-psychotics (to ""stop obessive thoughts"", which was their retarded diagnosis) was akathisia. I went to a priest, he told me to see a doctor about my ""depression"". I don't feel I have a disease called depression, I feel I am simply unhappy and lost in the world, probably because this world is a truly horrible place. 

I don't know what to do. Is there hope for my life? I'm tired and feel hopeless but I don't want to die. I don't want to kill myself, I want to be genuinely happy, to have a good life. I don't think this will work but I'll try.

Background - male, major depressive disorder with anxiety. My libido has been non existent for years it seemed like, but have been on new meds the last 3 months and they seem to be working. 

The win - I’ve literally had a morning wood waking up every day this week, and my libido is up. It’s been years since this has happened, I actually teared up this morning. I know this might sound dumb....It just was something I thought I wasn’t ever going to get back. It felt normal, and normal isn’t a feeling I’ve had in a long time.",1614705936.0
559,Does your depression go away when you do something that you find addictive? Is this a way of running away from your problems or could this actuallly be a sign that you are improving?,"I have some sort of mental issue for sure over the past few years. I have had consistent suicidal thoughts over the past 6 years (on and off of course, with some years a lot worse than others). I've also felt really sad and energyless compared to my other friends.

&#x200B;

One sign which sort of indicated that I was just not bored about my life was when I realised that I never looked forward to anything. Even when I was talking to a super pretty girl and had a good day, the second I came out from that situation I would feel extremely sad. There were also times where I'd be having a decent time and then I'd think about my emotions from the previous night or something and I'd feel sad. A couple of good examples: 

1. I went to something similar to Ultra (EDM festival). Had a decent time the first day. The second day, I was hanging out with my friends after the night was done and I went to my hotel room to charge my phone. I was alone for a bit with my own thoughts and got really sad. I was finding it tough to be happy for the rest of the trip. 
2. I went on a trek and was super excited. Went ahead of my friends for a while and got lost in my thoughts and started feeling angry at how I could feel sad when I was supposed to be having the time of my life. I cried quite a lot because I felt really bad that I couldn't even remain happy in a situation like this. 

&#x200B;

I also have found that when I distract myself by playing video games which I'm addicted to, I feel temporary relief. I often regret playing it the second after I stop, but during the 3-4 hours I do play, I feel ok. While people say that video games can be a stress buster, my ""stress"" is not from work, but rather from my mind. I feel that I'm just not dealing with my problems by playing video games. And often, it ends up making my problems worse, because I feel like I've wasted my time playing games that do not provide any long term happiness to me anyway. 

&#x200B;

I've been taking B12/Vitamin D supplements based on my physical examination and it's been going on for about a month now. I feel like I might have to take anti deps soon if my physician asks me to see a psychologist. I've also really been contemplating suicide recently. I feel like the lure of suicide is because it's such a beautiful solution that really covers all bases:

* All your pain ends.
* If you have messed up in your life, people might forgive you because you had issues.
* Explaining that you have fucked up because of your mental issues which you need to deal with sounds retarded. Suicide allows you to close all these loops in a single action.
* Less chance of negatively affecting people around you in the long run.
* Chance to see what's in the afterlife (is it pure darkness, another life, am I the only one who exists?). Whatever this is, it's super exciting to actually know that you might experience something or nothing.

I won't commit suicide because I'm not man enough to do it, but it sure does seem like the perfect solution to my problems (purely objectively speaking). I know that if my life turns around, the thought of suicide itself as a serious option ceases to exist which is interesting in itself, but as a suicidal person, I definitely do think that it is the perfect solution.",1611498880.0
560,Take a break from the news and social media; doomscrolling through negative stories impacts your mental health,"One of my less mindful habits is that I’m sometimes a bit of a news junkie - I’d happily sit in front of the news channel or scrolling through twitter when a big story is happening. This can be bad for our wellbeing though, particularly as the algorithm that controls our news feed is designed to provoke a reaction from us. Emotions like fear and anger are a lot more likely to grab people’s attention than happiness, so the content that we get fed through tends to water the seeds of anxiety and resentment.   

We can notice how much time we’re depending on the news and social media and limit ourselves, setting a regular alarm on our phone (the Plum Village app is good for this). When it goes off, if you’re watching the news or on social media, just stop, breath, notice your thoughts, notice what you’re feeling. With more awareness, you can make informed decisions about the media you consume and decide for yourself when to stop. 

But the evidence shows that with the news and social media, less is more. You can get a summary of whats going on once or twice a day - with the time you save you can call up a friend, go for a walk, enjoy nature. Its critical to be aware of what you consume, not just through your mouth but through your eyes and ears as well. The seeds we water create the garden we live in.

My partner and I are in a stable, but not optimal living situation. I have the tools, resources, and skills to get us out of it, but when my partner talks poorly about our situation, instead of being motivated to work harder, I freeze up and can't focus on my work and get really anxious.

562,How do you know that you aren't faking being depressed?,"Lately, when the pressure gets to me and I'm going over a scenario in my head for the 100th time, I just feel really shit. It's like a mini panic attack and I need to forcefully breathe out to eventually snap out of it. I feel like I'm going really over the top. This is not normal human behaviour and it feels like I'm crying for attention (idk from who, because no one IRL knows). 

&#x200B;

I've had a 1-2 major panic attacks in the past which lasted for 2-3 hours, but these ones recently are 1-5 minutes long only. I have always questioned if I'm just using depression as an excuse for not doing well since I haven't really excelled at anything in life in the past 7 years. 

&#x200B;

I don't know why the doubts have been popping in my head lately again, but I do seem to be getting worse. At some level I'm convinced suicide is the way forward. I feel like my life has been a mess and killing myself sort of ties all the loose ends in my life story perfectly together. But then again, I feel like I'll never kill myself because it requires pain to others and I don't think I can really push myself over the edge of depression and have such an extreme emotional reaction and actually kill myself. Hence, I feel like these suicidal thoughts are just a way of me begging for attention from you guys here reading my posts. 

&#x200B;

When I was in college as well, I used to do these emotional things hoping that my friends would notice me. I have literally just left my discord server because it was really painful to act like everything is fine.  But I think I'm subtly hoping that someone will notice and talk to me about how I'm feeling. 

&#x200B;

I think I'm really looking for someone to tell me that the past 7 years were because of my depression. I'm just really confused. I'm probably just going to sleep on it. Please don't leave long replies. I feel like I've gotten a lot of advice in the past and never have used it. I have no doubt that you guys are making a difference to hundreds of people with your comments, but I don't think my problem is not knowing what to do. It's more related to myself internally.",1605381918.0

I know his sister should come first but I can't get over the feeling of being abandoned. It is so stupid and jealous of me but it really hurts and brings up stuff from being abandoned when I was a child. It makes me feel doubly awful for feeling upset with him.

565,Feeling lost and sorry for losing my creativity and enjoyment.,"Hi there, I have never posted here before but have been a member for a little while now. Because of quarantaine I've had loads of time to think about myself and felt the need to share my story (not because I want attention but I want to know what other people might think about it).   
English isn't my first language and I suck at typing so sorry if it might be a bit confusing once in a while. 

When I was 15 I had my first depression that lasted for about a year/a year and a half. I unfortunately got into self-harm and I still bare the scars on my arm and upper right leg. I eventually reached out to my mom and dad and I started going to a psych. They thought I might have autism because they simply couldn't figure out why a 15 year old that had a 'perfect' life would be depressed (We don't have any money problems at home, back then my parents were still together, school was fine, etc). It turned it I didn't fit into the autism spectrum. Therapy didn't help one bit but at a certain point I kind of just defeated the depression and started feeling happy again.

A while back when I started my first study (English teacher) I started getting similar complaints to the ones I had when I was 15. I didn't sleep well, wasn't happy, was less carefull in traffic, didn't enjoy things and felt reallllyy lost. Something that was new was that I started feeling really anxious around people and groups, something I had never ever experienced before (I am usually very social and confident). Because I obviously recognised the symptoms I immediately reached out to my doctor and het got me in touch with the GGZ (it's a sort of organisation that is focused on mental health problems and complaints in teens and young adults). I have been going there once a week for 7 months now and there has been no progress.   
The people that are treating me are once again thinking it is autism because they (and this is a literal quote, as far as I can remember the exact words though); ""Can't figure out why I would be feeling this way. It isn't a depression, it isn't a mental illness, they are depressive complaints because of something else"". I'm getting a bit bored and sick of the same shit again and again, it's already been proven that it isn't autism and I have once again fixed it on my own (something I absolutely DON'T recommend, it just happened because the treatment took too long). 

I started going to the gym, ate healthier, started meditating every day and tried to keep myself occupied which worked abolute wonders and is why I've been able to beat this second depression for the most part and survive quarantaine the way I have. (I recommend everyone that has mental complaints to try to exercise and meditate a lot besides getting professional help if you didn't already, it helped a lot at my worst moments. 

&#x200B;

I guess I just wanted to share my story with some people who might understand it a bit better. I'm currently 19 years old and live in the Netherlands. I was always very creative (always drawing and building creative things) but this dissapeared after my first depression. I'm not dumb (It turns out I've got an IQ of 139), I like philosophy a lot and love socialising. Depression is something that pretty much every male in my family has been diagnosed with. I can't get antidepressants because noone thinks it is a real depression (which means I can't get treated for a depression but only for depressive complaints). 

I feel bad for no longer being creative, feeling less joy in general in life, being a lot more serious, I feel like an outcast in society.

566,When do you disclose your mental health issue to your friends?,"I told my close friend (of 6 years) about it and she essentially ghosted me. Before that, a really close friend of 2 years cut contact with me and all our mutual friends when I told him I had depression (we had a deep conversation after he told me that he wanted to be in a relationship with me).

I feel like somebody will suggest ""don't share"" but I'm sick of worrying about if my friends are ok with the fact that I struggle with depression. I'm sick of acting like I'm okay. I want to be around people that wholly love and accept me as a person, struggles and flaws and all.

I've gotten so paranoid and hurt over this that I casually dropped the fact that I was seeing a therapist and taking meds for depression to a new friend I've only known for a week that I met playing sports. Overdisclosure? Probably. But I can't handle putting time and love and care into people and close friendships, only to watch them ghost me when I say ""I struggle with depression"".",1584820039.0

568,How do I find motivation as a suicidal leech?,"I'll try to keep this clear and straight to the point. So, like most of everyone else struggling with depression, I have trouble leaving my home, finding the motivation to go to the gym (being active is something I loved to do) and maintaining a clean home. Leaving my bed is an extremely difficult task to the point that I forget to eat and drink water.   


Basically, I'm suicidal. The first thing I say to myself every morning is ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" Hell, I've even caught myself saying those things in my sleep. I always unconsciously repeat variations of this idea to myself. Sometimes I don't realize it happened until after the fact.   


I haven't been to therapy in quite a few months, so this is obviously something I need to address. Also, I have been on SSRIs (along with a cocktail of other medications) and I didn't enjoy that, so I'm not interested in that route.   


What I am trying to get at is how do I find motivation again? What do y'all recommend? I just want to go back to the gym and maintain a healthy environment but anything I do falls short or I can't keep up with it.",1581614348.0

A little while after I started high school in 2011 is when so much of it came back to me. I guess that going into my early teens I felt like I'd be personally stronger if I was able to hold it all back. I now realise this has all built up over time and haven't been able to tear up properly even when trying to. 

The other night I watched Grave of the fireflies which was just as sad as I'd heard but still couldn't get the urge to just bawl. At times I've tried listening to sad songs but hasn't done much either. A lot of it is partly a lack of trying but I'm seriously interested in finding a way to have a healthy cry for once.

As you can expect, it’s been hard. As fuck.

Without getting  bogged down in details let me just state some of the things that have happened. Depression, anxiety, failing three consecutive semesters, changing majors twice, changing medications, hospital visits, deaths, going through six part time jobs, and addictions.

This week, I will turn in my final exam for Managerial economics, finishing up my core classes for my major (Economics). I still have a year of gen eds to take.

It may seem like a small milestone, and it is, but finishing up this class will be kind of the end of a road for me.

I look forward to the future with a healthy bit of skepticism. Life has been hard, and there will be hardships to come. At least I like my current job, and may even be able to make a real career out of it with my degree.

572,Be nice to all the staff at the doctor's office. Not just the doctor,"I work in the eye care field. I prescreen patients and work the front desk as well. I can't tell you how many people treat me like shit and are completely charming to the doctor. Luckily, my doc knows what's up and doesn't put up with it. 



I could never fathom treating someone the way I have been treated at work. People get all out hostile over very silly things.


 ""That person went back before me!"" Well that's because you're 15 minutes late for your appointment. If you want to get started on time, show up on time. 


""I have NEVER paid this much for an eye exam before"" I literally quoted you your max out of pocket price and you said ""okay"" 


""Why do you need my insurance card and ID? This is a scam"" No sir. I'm just trying to make sure you didn't steal someone's identity or insurance. As insurance fraud is a real thing. 



Then you get people that will lie to you about their medical history because they don't trust you with that knowledge. They want to only tell the doctor. But that's problematic because I need to inform the doctor of all your ailments. 


""You already have my insurance on file!"" Yes ma'am, but I need to scan the physical card into your chart once a year""

He was berating me for how I pushed his wheel chair but refused to move it on his own (he was very capable to do so) he was a total dick and it was unnecessary. 


Long story short, be nice to everyone in the office. We don't make the rules for insurance. We don't make the prices. We don't have control over anything. We literally just work there and are screwed everyday by the same system you are.",1558396545.0
573,Have to let it out. Trying to get over it for my whole life.," 

Hello, i come clear and directly to the point.

My  surname was ""Gay"" for a long time and it pretty much fucked my life up  completely.I got teased the whole time. My parents never understood how  it fucked my life, education and mind. The funny thing is, that im the  only one, beside from my parents, blessed with this name. My grudge  followed me 16 years until i decided on my own to change my name.

As  a result: i'm 25, struggling to get and keep a job, can't socialize  very well and have no plans for the future other than get done with life  as fast as possible. I still live with my parents, who still got the  name, and try to hide it as good as i can, when i meet new people. Truth  therefore has been a problem for years. I also lived pretty isolated  for a big amount of time, especially in puberty, to hide from bullying.

Everytime  i hear the word ""Gay"" i get angry. Instant adrenaline kicks and foggy  brain. I get sad and im thinking about ending it all, but i've never  been near doing so.

My head is pretty  fucked up and im thinking about the 16 years, that where full off shit,  and why my parents have done this to me. I think about all the missed  opportunities (lived a pretty lonely live because of the name) and how  my life would have been if i had a normal name.

To  other people, that i meet new im acting under my new name and try to be  friendly and happy, but deep down inside im pretty broken. I tried this  way of living life for a few years now, but yet, where i see how others  have evolved and i have crippeld more i don't now how to go on anymore.  I got an exellent lieer of the years, to protect myself. I lie on a  daily basis and often without recognizing it.

To  make the whole thing round, i have to mention, that i was involved in a  car accident at the age of 5, shortly before starting school and  beginning of the mobbing. I got a big scar in my face, brain trauma and  had to be fixed on the hospital bed, because i was freaking out. There  was a lot of therapy after this. (\~4 years)

My  level of education, schoolwise, is in the lower section, but i thing i  could have done better, without this big problem sitting in my neck.

The  mobbing started when i six and ended pretty much with changing my name.  So \~10 years of eating shit on a daily basis. A lot of people still  know about me, because i was a ""legend"" back then (not in the positive  sence of meaning)

I dont know whats  wrong with me, but i know something is pretty wrong. I'm interested in  my  state of mind and how fucked my head really is.

Maybe  i got ptsd from this. but im not sure. I don't want to annoy anyone,  but maybe someone has experienced similiar things and can tell me what  helped them to get over it.

Sorry  for bad grammer etc. I'm pretty down and shaky at the moment. English  is not my native language, so please excuse the bad sentence structure..

575,Disability and getting better (great news),"**GREAT NEWS, YOU GUYS!!!** And hopefully it's encouraging for some of you!

As a matter of fact, she said ""I don't know anyone else that's more qualified for this."" 😮


This means she thinks I'm healthy enough to train, get my certification, start my business, and make enough to get off of disability!! I'm so happy right now! I have my reservations and fears, but I put a lot of stock in how she sees me. 😊


*To give you perspective*, I remember 5 or 6 years ago having a complete paranoid psychotic break (mixed bipolar episode I think) when I lost touch with reality, heard loads of voices calling my name, thought people were out to get me... and all I could do is rock myself and cry in a dark room. 


And now I'm here!!! I'm so happy! 


I wanted to share this because I know some of you are really going through it right now. And I just want to let you know that it CAN get better. How?

576,The beliefs that have held me back,"Recently I've made a lot of positive strides in my life, mostly by reading a lot about my mental issues, and as I have I've noticed more and more beliefs of mine falling away. I started examining my beliefs under the guidelines of ""Is this making my life less enjoyable?"" Here are all the ones I've found so far, in the hopes it will inspire others to examine their own beliefs and drop any that are making their lives worse. Some of these I've dropped recently, some I've dropped long ago, but I'm so glad I've dropped them all.


-If my life isn't ideal, I'm not allowed to enjoy it to the fullest.


-If I'm upset, I absolutely have to do something to numb or distract from the pain.


-Other peoples' idea of my life should be taken as guidelines.


-Failure to live up to others' expectations matters and should make me feel guilty.


-Being alone is a bad thing.


-Doing nothing is more comfortable and makes me happier than being active.


-There's a perfect version of me to achieve. This one is not it.


-I am not supposed to make myself happy. Others are.


-Confidence means having the perfect life.


-Being flawless should be my endgame.


-There is a better life for me than this one.


-Without the things I want, I'm supposed to be hopeless.


-I'm supposed to be afraid of others finding out my flaws.


-I'm not supposed to enjoy my talents or accomplishments, I'm supposed to downplay them until even I don't find them worth celebrating.


-I'm supposed to regret my failures and judge myself for them.


-I shouldn't be grateful until I am happy.


-My life is chipping away at me little by little.


-Getting help is shameful and embarrassing, and/or I should apologize for asking for it.


-No one else could possibly understand me or relate.


-Nothing can make this bad moment better, so I shouldn't try.


-Being overwhelmed with negative emotions means I'm a failure.


-If the road to progress looks long and steep, I'm too exhausted to take it.


-I should try to control everything possible to make things better.


-The only option for the negative things I experience that are out of my control is to let them frustrate me.


I'm sure there are more, but these are what come to mind. A lot of them are about perfectionism for me, which is a tendency I've started giving up in the past month. In return, I feel a bit like the main character in Office Space right after his hypnosis session. I see all the things that used to drive me crazy and frustrate me to no end, about myself, others, and the world, and even though I'm experiencing them all again, my perspective has shifted. I now have started asking ""Am I caring too much about this?"" and if caring about whatever it is makes me miserable, the answer is almost always yes. I now relax myself, let go of what I can't control, remember my main goal is to live an enjoyable life, and I let it be.


Hope this helps someone. There's an old Taoist teaching about how a sturdy, firm tree has brittle branches that will break in a the average storm. Meanwhile, a flexible, lean tree has branches that will only sway even in a hurricane. Flexibility is strength. The more flexible I am with my beliefs, the easier it is to drop old toxic ones, add new healthy ones, and endure the storms in my life.",1554909327.0
577,How to cut ties with terrible therapist?,"In January, I started seeing a therapist for the first time in my life. I chose her mostly because she accepted my insurance, and she was the only one available of the few therapists I cold-contacted. I didn't feel a particularly strong connection, but I kept going, because I don't even know what a good therapist would be like.

Recently, at the end of my tenth session, I let her know that earlier that day I had just accepted a new job offer, so my insurance would be changing, and I would no longer be able to see her because she would be out of network. She immediately became incredibly cold and even cruel, saying things like, ""Funny how you chose to bring it up at the end of the session. Do you know how many patients I turned down because you committed to this regular time each week? Do you know that this is how I make a living, and that this decision costs me business? There are consequences for ME, not just you.""

It was terrible. I was shocked and hurt and started crying and just kept apologizing over and over again (looking back at it, I shouldn't have had to apologize at ALL). She sent me away with an order to look at my new job's medical insurance plan again in case there was something I could do to keep seeing her. Still crying, I just said okay to whatever and left.

Obviously, I don't want to keep seeing her, even if I could afford it. This was such a terrible experience, especially considering I'm so new to therapy. Can I just ghost her, not email her even though I said I would? Or should I email her and tell her exactly why I don't want to continue seeing her anyway (could this have negative repercussions on me if she becomes vengeful or something?)? Or should I email her with a simple, ""I'm no longer engaging your services"" without any reason?

Thank you. I appreciate it.

ETA: thanks so much for the advice and the kind words, everyone. I’m incredibly grateful. I think what I’ll do is ghost/not proactively contact her, while also seeing if I can file an official complaint with the state licensing board.

578,Finally figured out what to do with my life!,"I hope this is the right place for this.  


I'm nearly 30 and have been completely stuck trying to figure out a career path for myself which has caused my anxiety and depression to be quite bad (to put it mildly). I thought I knew what I wanted to do but every time I would venture into that specific career path I have been met with severe crippling anxiety and depression. I spent 5 years getting 2 degrees in this subject and never could figure out a path for myself and kept forcing myself into situations that I hated, that caused me anxiety attacks and major depression, because I thought that's what I had to do to get where I wanted (whatever that may have been).

I suffer from pretty bad social anxiety, chronic depression, and chronic anxiety. I've worked in retail for 10-ish years now and thought that if I just suffered through that it'd get easier and I would stop having daily panic attacks. It's only gotten harder. About a month or two ago I had one of the worst anxiety attacks I think I've ever had while at work. I became so sick afterwards that I couldn't go to work for a week+, and I am still dealing with some of the problems that attack caused within my body.

After that anxiety attack I had to seriously consider what I wanted to do with my life and I finally know what I want to do and have a pretty clear path in front of me now. I am switching jobs, getting out of customer service (finally). I have a long road ahead of me to get to where I want to be but I have taken the first steps with a company that will allow me to grow and move up to my desired career. The job I will be starting soon is not glorious by any means, and I've had several people question why I'm doing it, telling me that I should work in customer service  because I'm so good at it (Spoiler alert: no I'm not, I just have a good ""Customer Service"" voice) ... but all I know is that I am so incredibly excited and happy with this new job, with this new path, and knowing I won't be stuck being miserable in jobs that I hate.

Edit: I'm going to stop talking to this girl. I think I only want a girlfriend because I'm extremely lonely.

I lack the same social skills. I lack a lot of what made me, well, me before my breakup (my breakup was awful and landed me in the hospital twice.) I was betrayed, hurt, and lied to, so I put myself, my real self, in a shell, because I was scared of getting hurt more. It's a damn shame, too: I had some of the best friends you could ask for back then who would never have hurt me, and now I'm hundreds of miles away from those people. The person I am now, this docile and meek shell of a man is not who I really am or was. This... thing I am now is best suited to having depression as their primary mode in life. I'm not depressed anymore. I need the me who knows how to socialize properly and be himself back.

  


This is something that I think happens to a lot of people, even if you're extroverted or whatever. Hell, I sure was. The goal has to be to get confidence back and go back to living life in an enjoyable way now that I *can* enjoy it. I bet it'll be hard, but the thing is, I almost welcome it. This is the homestretch, when I get to combine everything that I've learned and fixed about myself during this past year of depression with who I used to be, and make a stronger, better person out of that. This is when I get to go from Luke at the end of Empire Strikes Back to Luke from Return of the Jedi. I just have to *find* Luke from Jedi first. He's gotta be in here somewhere.

I'm writing this because as I'm reading back on these posts, it reminds me of where I used to be six years ago, and that lonely, hopelessness that used to gnaw at me what felt like forever. I don't want to write this as any authority or someone who's 'made it'. Life still has its challenges and I'm not one to think of myself as 'crushing it' or having it all put together. Just want to put that out there; if that's the vibe you're getting from me, don't read further and just move my post in the trash. I know I wouldn't really want to read anything like myself.

It may or may not get better. But I've learned, and continue to humbly learn, that you start to see the pattern. You start to see the game that you're set up in your mind. Some days, it's claustrophobic and you just want to run out and scream. Other days, it's so deadening that you want to sit on the floor and cry until there's no tears left and all the joy in the world has evaporated into the dark chasm. Your dreams will feel like they're just holographic films playing in a make believe world, while the nightmares and terrors start caving in.

But I somehow fought them. I don't know how, honestly. I can't tell you a twelve step program, or a book that gives you the answers, or something to tell yourself. You don't. This is the terrible game that's set up. You can't trust your mind. But fucking hell, you fight it, somehow, with everything that you have. Even in the pit of hell, you look for something, anything, you find that piece of brilliant light that's buried in the middle of the black flames, and you find your way out.

You can do this, even on the days you feel like you can't. Especially on the days that feel like you can't. You take out that sheet of paper that has your goals or your dreams - maybe shit went down and they're not real or they seem so far in the distance like climbing the range of a mountain and all you have left is a ragged jacket and some biscuits. You feel like you have nothing. The world tells you to march on, like you're just walking up a hill, like what you're seeing doesn't matter. It's shit. You feel like shit.

But your truth, the truth that it hurts and you're in pain, and the mountains are real, and the ice is cold and bitter. That's real. You know it. You can feel it in your bones. And I know it; it is real, those moments are real. Terror can be real some days, and it can crush you.

But I know, somewhere inside you, and somewhere inside me, there's a voice that keeps you here. You think it's weakness, that if you were really courageous, you would end the nightmare and leave this world behind because there's nothing left in it. The voice that tells you to stop and let go of the noose and go back to the humdrum, you think that's just the fear. It's not. What keeps you alive, is you, is the real you. If you post here, if you write anything to reach out, you're reaching out to the world and grabbing that tiny light in the darkness. Maybe you don't post, or you're anonymous, or you think no one cares. But that voice tells you, you're alive, stay alive!

I lived the nightmares for years. For years. And I look back, and I don't even recognize who I used to be. I don't know how to tell you, that something can change and you can get better. I can't say that without feeling like I'm letting you all down, because I know my old self would never believe that. I couldn't then. And maybe I can't really now - it doesn't feel like I need to get better anymore. Life is so beautiful, even in the muck and the rain, and the dark clouds that roll into my mind. The voices are still alive and well, but I've learned them. I've learned their terrible tricks and well conceived plans. And I know they're not me. And wow, what a life to live, my friends. I don't know the secret to living with demons, but somehow, that voice that tells you to stay alive. It's right. I've been given so much more than I can ever possibly imagine. And of course, I have my goals and dreams, some of them unfulfilled, others just waiting and incubating. They're hatching, little chicks that need tender love. The voices come and they try to steal them away, to pull them into the black pit. But today, I gave those baby chicks love and they're growing. They're bigger than the pit; they're so big and wide and beautiful, that they can't even fit in the pit. The pit looks like a tiny crack in the earth now, some moment in time that has no place anymore.

I don't know if you can do that; I'm not going to tell you that that's going to be you. But I want to believe that, I have so much hope that there's a way to move forward for everyone here. You're here, you're reading this. You want it too, I know you do. I was there, sitting on my computer, in tears trying to figure out a way to throw myself in front of a train. I can remember that moment, and a friend calls who was supposed to meet with me. And then, I get some help, and I'm in the hospital. I remember those events, like dreams far away. Like a nightmare I once remembered as a little boy.

Now I have more than I can even believe. It's unreal. I don't say that to boast. It's little things, small things, like an espresso in the morning, or looking out the window and realizing I have a place to stay away from the cold. It's going on a drive with the woman I love, and singing show tunes. It's laughing because I said something silly that doesn't make sense, and realizing it's all a great big joke. Not one I would ever trade in for the world. A joke with beauty, and laughter, and light.

And I've lost things. Good friends, people I wish I'd connected more with, relationships that never quite worked out. I've had my regrets, and maybe I revisit them for old time's sake. But they don't own me anymore. Who I was, I give love to that person. I know they did the best they could do. I know you, in your own way, even in your nightmares and pain. You are doing the best you can. It's so hard to hear that, and know that, and believe it's true. I know. It's almost like slicing your gut open to hear that, and let that in. But there's love there. If you read this, if you can feel it in your bones, there is love there. It will keep you alive. It will keep you above the water, the terrible blue depths of the drowning ocean.

And one day, you'll learn to swim that ocean, and dive right in.

Good day to you, and may all your dreams, hopes, and goals be fulfilled, in one way or another, in the form appropriate for you. May love reach you, from wherever it's meant to come.",1516881503.0
589,Finally got my sewing machine out of the closet - feel so proud of myself!,"I started dealing with depression and anxiety about 6 years ago.  Around the same time I stopped sewing, painting, drawing, doing anything creative.  This has always been a huge part of me, so avoiding these activities been a consistent source of negative feelings and failure.  It's like the more I don't do anything creative, the more I feel like a waste and the more anxiety and pressure I put on myself, which makes it harder and harder to do.  

My therapist and I have been talking about breaking it down into little steps.  On Thursday I finally cleaned off my desk, which had become a giant pile of trash.  Earlier today I got my sewing machine down and hooked it up.  A few hours ago I threaded it.  And just now I sewed 3 quilt squares together (A project I had started back in 2011).  

This is such a HUGE step for me.  When I started sewing tonight I got such a rush of happiness and I remembered why I love it.  Now, afterwards, I'm already anxious about the idea of doing it again tomorrow, but I've done it once, I can do it again.  Hopefully soon, if I continue (WHEN I continue), the feelings of happiness and pride will replace the anxiety, or at least diminish it.  

I really wanted to text someone and tell them about this, but every time I type it out it seems so ridiculous.  I just found this group and I'm hoping you are the type of people that understand what a huge thing this is.  Thanks for reading.",1515293018.0
590,I can't get myself to go to school and it's ruining my life.,"This is a problem I've had my entire life. It really started becoming a problem in middle school, but I was already faking illnesses to get out of class in 5th grade. I'm a senior in high school now and I still haven't gotten over this. I'm absent MOST days (2-3 days a week) so it's almost impossible to stay caught up and get decent grades.

There's no real reason for it, either. When I DO go to class, I have no trouble understanding the material (I was always considered a ""gifted"" kid). I have a good group of friends. I'm not bullied or anything. You could even say I'm somewhat popular. There's really no logical reason for me not to like school. I want to succeed, because I know I'm capable of it when I actually try.
But every morning when my alarm goes off, my ability to think rationally disappears. ANYTHING seems better than getting up and going to school. I’ll think of any possible excuse or justification not to go, regardless of how delusional it might be. I tell myself it’s not that big of a deal if I stay home ONE more day, I’ll catch up when I go back. And if not, I can just drop out. At least that way I won’t have to wake up at 6 in the goddamn morning 5 days a week.

Obviously those kinds of thoughts are irrational and self-destructive, but at the time all I can think about is everything I hate about school.

I hate that I have to waste 7 hours of my day being forced to sit still and be quiet. Being forced to socialize. Being forced to mindlessly complete worksheets that I couldn’t care less about. I hate the fact that once I get there, I’m trapped there (my mom won’t pick me up early anymore). But most of all, I hate the boredom. I spend the majority of my time in class watching the clock, but it never seems to move. I hate how mind-numbingly slow it goes by. I can’t stand it.

I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADD, all of which contribute to this, I’m sure. But as of right now, medication isn’t an option for me. But SOMETHING needs to change. I can’t keep living like this. I lost my job that I loved because my grades are so bad I couldn’t even get a work permit. My mom is constantly mad at me for skipping so much. My friends are starting to forget about me. My teachers are starting to give up on me. No matter how much sleep I get, no matter how much I prepare for the morning the night before, I just can’t seem to get up and do it.

I’m sure some of you have dealt with this, maybe not to this extent, but ANY advice would be appreciated. Online/alternative school isn’t an option for me at this point in the semester, either. If any of you have found a way to make school slightly less dreadful, I’m open to trying anything. Thanks in advance for any replies.

TL;DR: I'm chronically absent and failing most of my classes because I can't get myself up in the morning. I'm desperate for any advice/input/tips on how to force myself to go to school everyday.",1513051832.0
591,[Method] How to get out of your head and stop worrying about things that are out of your control,"**HEY CHILL OUT  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯**

Undoubtedly stressing over something that is out of our control is one of the worst negative feelings we can experience. You know you can’t do anything about it, but the thought keeps playing and replaying in your mind, over and over and over again. 
You might have experienced it when you went for a job interview and kept thinking about the outcome while waiting for the result. You might have experienced it when you remembered a certain way you acted or something you said to someone. Again the mind just keeps replaying the thought over and over. Some of us experience it in regards to our insecurities for example many short men can’t stop thinking about their height when talking to females, crippling their confidence. 
I personally used to experience it when I was younger whenever my parents flew oversees; my mind would keep thinking “what if their plan crashed?” These thoughts used to stress me out as a youngster.

Also here is a link to the video summarizing this post for those who hate reading[**WATCH THIS :D**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko-GlB2crFU&t=12s)

**How to deal with it**

Luckily there is a method to help you deal with this stress, one that I and many other have found to be effective. What you have to understand about the mind is that it is split into two parts, the conscious mind and the subconscious mind. If I say ‘don’t think about Donald Trump naked riding a bomb like a horse waving a cowboy hat while falling out of the sky’ odds are you probably thought of it. The image in your head was created subconsciously while reading the text, however it is your conscious mind that decides to FOCUS on it if you let it. What I am trying to say here is that you can’t control all the thoughts that enter your mind, but you can control which ones you give energy and focus to with your conscious brain.
So you will always have negative thoughts the solution is to not put energy into them. Now you can only consciously focus on a few things at one time. So the easiest way to get out of your head is to put your focus elsewhere, the easiest place being your body.  So when you start thinking those negative thoughts here are a few things you can focus on:

•	Your breath inhaling and exhaling out of your lungs

•	Your extremities the sensations of your feet and hands

•	Try see if you can feel or listen to your heartbeat

•	The noises that you can hear how far can you hear?

•	The things you can see, how much detail can you perceive?

•      What can you smell, can you notice any subtleties?

•     Count from 50 backwards in your mind, picturing each number.

The idea is to try to put your full conscious awareness into any one of these things, try really focusing on it and something magical will happen. The stress you were feeling will slowly go away. Now you might have to do this a few times a day each time the thought pops up before your mind gets the idea. The mind will eventually say “Ok we can’t fuck with this guy/girl “and give up on the thought.

**SCIENCE B**&***

 You were good at science yes? Remember
 ‘Energy cannot be created not destroyed’
It can only be transferred.
 You cannot put your energy into the negative thoughts and emotions while pouring it into something else! Eventually with practice using this method when that sneaky thought creeps up on you, you might actually laugh “uhh my old friend”, you might say before ignoring it and caring on with your life stress free.
Anyway guy if you liked that post make sure you check the video out I did for it and show some love!

593,How to get over one's own toxic behavior?,"I recently been confronted by the fact that I have a toxic behavior due to anxiety, low self worth, fears of rejection and not being loved, etc. This toxic behavior includes from jealousy to confronting and making others feel bad or that they hurt me, so that I can feel important or not lower than them.
This caused me to loose my last girlfriend, a lovely person. Who despite of been able to see this problem kept me around and tried to help me endlessly. However, after some months of escalating episodes, she's obviously had enough.
So without even being able to react, paralyzed by my own anxiety I lost a person that loved me dearly and that I really really love.
I've decided I've had enough of this and confronted my problems. I go to a therapist, go to the gym, play more music, a thing I really love. And also improved in my work and care more about myself.
I know I will not fix this in a week. But I was wondering if someone else found him/herself in a similar situation and how were you able to overcome your own toxic behavior.

594,Cleaning is so hard,"My boyfriend had a very upset talk with me yesterday about my housekeeping skills. He's working and studying, I'm just working and for fewer hours than he works, so the cleaning and cooking are my jobs right now. I have major problems with it. I just can't keep the house clean. I have no motivation, no habits to go into (and the lack of motivation stops me starting new habits). I get very tired from my work due to my anxiety and depression issues, so though he thinks I have lots of free time, it doesn't feel like it to me. I need a lot of down time.
I've tried making time tables for myself, but I can't force myself to do it very often. I do a lot of cleaning at work too so it feels like I'm just doing lots.

It helps me when someone else is cleaning with me, it keeps me going, but my boyfriend is not available right now. Mum's been coming over every week to help out but during the week I somehow manage to trash it. I have too much 'stuff' (much less than I used to have though thank goodness) and I have tried to declutter but it's still too much.

596,My best friend died 9 years ago today. (Suicide),"Not sure where to start, but for some reason it seems much harder this year that most of the past years.

At this point its not about the loss of a close friend so much as what *he's* missed out on in life that he would have really enjoyed, and I would have enjoyed sharing with him.

New bands, new movies, new video games, new hobbies, just so much he's missed out on.

Since he left us I've been to college, married, had two kids. I know life looked bleak for both of us back then, we were both 21 and not really doing anything with our lives and it was a lot of ""whats the point,"" but so much good has come round since then.

I don't know, just kind of at a loss about it today. My wife knows about him despite that she never met him, but my current friends and co-workers have no idea, nor do I want to share with them because I don't want to be *that guy*.

Sorry, I just wanted to share how I'm feeling with someone out in the world. He was probably the person I've been closest to in my life other than my wife (who I met shortly after he died, she kind of pulled me out of the dark).

I've been pretty lonely in many ways since then. I don't see myself ever having another friend I can be that close with again in life- in some ways that is the hardest part of it in the long term.

598,Any other gamers had a moment of realisation regarding the futility of gaming?,"As a gamer, have you ever stopped and had a moment of total clarity in the realisation that you are wasting your life when you play to excess? 

Hi guys, male in early 20s here. I've been playing video games since I can remember, I was 3 years old when I got my first console (Sega Mega Drive) and remember spending hours on Sonic / other games til I got the PS1/N64/Gameboy in the late 90s. I always got a console the year it came out up until the Xbox 360 until ""graduating"" to PC gaming in 2010-12. I have been regularly playing games until the end of last year without really ever taking a break from it in my life, usually playing for hours a day.

I never really had friends until late in high school, at which point puberty hit and I was suddenly sought after by quite a lot of girls out of the blue, made friends, went to parties and enjoyed all of that until I was 18/19. I still played video games to excess back then, I would avoid homework and even sometimes would avoid meeting friends to play games (though I never lost friendships over it). 

However, I lost most of those friends and the attention when I hit 19 and for the last few years I've had a long term relationship but no real friends. Now, this is where the point I'm about to make comes in. When I lost my friends I simply upped my amount of hours playing games, and gaming made me okay with not having friends, gaming made me okay with the poor choices I've made regarding education and work. Whatever was wrong in my life, was being ignored because video games gave me the illusion of social contact, the illusion of living; World of Warcraft was a big one for this. The poor choices being, not getting a job because I would have rather played video games and skipping college for literally a year to play Skyrim / Battlefield / WoW.

But for whatever reason, about 3 months ago I hit a point where gaming stopped appealing to me. I realised how empty my life is, the things I will never get back, the things I've missed and the people I miss.

Video Gaming made me okay with just sitting in the house all day, not moving forward with my life. It allowed me to ignore everything that was wrong. Finally I've started to improve things but I can't help but look back on all the years I've lost to this terrible addiction; an addiction that I didn't really realise I had either. I knew I was addicted to WoW which is why I stopped, what I didn't realise was that CoD and numerous RPG's like Skyrim, simply filled the void.

Has anyone else on this subreddit experienced what I'm talking about here? I'm not saying video gaming is bad, but for people like me who don't realise they are  playing to perpetually escape reality, it's definitely a problem.

Without video gaming my days now feel longer (not in a good way), and in all honesty I don't really know what to do with myself. 

Essentially, I think when a parent tells their child they are wasting their time playing games, they have their best interests at heart.

Opinions folks?

NOTE - I have stopped video gaming because I no longer enjoy it, not because I think it has been a factor in ruining my life, though this an undeniable fact. I'm not saying I'd never play video games again and I have nothing against people playing them, I guess 20 years of it just wore me out a bit. Though I will probably never buy another MMO or Bethesda game again.

602,I have done absolutely nothing with my life during the last 5 years. I have no idea how to really get over this. Can anybody help?,"I've been doing really poorly for the past few months. I was first diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 16, went into therapy, got on medication and things really turned around until I went through a traumatic experience during my senior year of high school. 

I'm about to complete my 5th year of college and about to turn 23. I have done absolutely nothing since my senior year of high school. It's been 5 years without a single friend, job, internship or good memory. I live with my parents and the only reason I even leave the house is to go to class (and I usually don't even bother to go). This isn't just an episode of depression, this is who I have become.

I have no idea how to get over this and start to actually participate in my life. I am really reaching my breaking point. I need a solution other than suicide.

My health insurance doesn't cover mental health. The cheapest therapists in my area are $60-80 a session. The cheapest psychiatrists are $200 a session. My college offers 10 free therapy sessions, but I can't go to them. My university automatically charges every student for health insurance unless you already have insurance and submit a waiver. They don't go over every single person's alternative insurance, they just do random audits. They recently made it mandatory that alternative health insurance covers mental health. I can't go to the university medical center to get the 10 sessions of therapy because they are going to ask for my insurance information, see that it doesn't cover mental health and require me to purchase the university health insurance, which I can't afford (and I don't want to be forced off my parent's insurance).

My mother has been in therapy for a while. She doesn't believe I was ever really depressed. When I asked her to ask her psychiatrist if I could just go to a normal doctor to get medication, she followed up the psychiatrist's answer with ""if you really think it is necessary"".

I don't understand this. I never leave the house, constantly skip class, have no friends, no hobbies and no motivation. I have asked my mom to ask her psychiatrist how I could get medication. Nobody seems to think anything is wrong with me. I have a fantasy of killing myself so they can realize they have no pictures, nothing to say about me and nobody will attend the funeral except family.

I have never come out and said ""I am depressed and need help"", I just hinted that I wanted to try medication again. Do you think I should just spell it out and ask my mom for help in finding a therapist? I can't pay for it myself. 

Is there anything else I can try to do to get better? I really need to get out of the house more, but I hate being out. Does anybody have any advice? Thank you.",1393976874.0

The therapist said perhaps I've been feeling so bad for so long that being depressive and negative and pessimistic has become a part of my personality, and that's why on some level I actually feel that I don't want to get well, even though I know I do... that maybe I'm afraid that a part of me will disappear...

I can't even imagine anymore what it feels like to be really happy, or what it feels like to want to live... no matter how I try and which situations I put myself into, I can't believe that I will at any point in the future consider life worth living. Yes, there are some good things in life that make it more bearable, but they don't make it worth living! I feel like I'm locked up in a small cell with nails all over the floor, and every day people come in and beat me up and give me some food, and everyone tries to cheer me up by saying 'hey this isn't as bad as you make it sound, think about the good things! you get food every day!' Like they can't understand that I would rather be out of the cell completely...

The best things in life are not free - the price is the worst things in life.""

I was quite shocked to read this, because even though I *frequently* remind myself how grateful I am that I was delivered from the darkness, I had forgotten just how bad it was. These days, even when I'm really sad and anxious (which still happens) I'm still the happiest person I know at the same time.

Reading through my old diary entries today, it's like I'm reliving it from the perspective of my future (or I mean present) self and it seems almost absurd that the same lifetime that contains such low points could *ever* lead to where I am now.

(On the other hand, one of my favorite [quotes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder): ""The depth of darkness to which you can descend and still live is an exact measure of the height to which you can aspire to reach."")

Anyway... If I had read a post like this ten years ago I would have not even seen the introduction and postscript, I would just bask in the misery parts. There is probably something to that ""law of attraction"" business, whether it's a matter of metaphysics or just psychology.

Well... I hope I cheered anyone up at all :]",1378090666.0

The medication and the pain put me into bad anxiety and depression. Didn’t help that the person I was seeing left/ghosted me although tbh they probs got scared of my intense emotions. My wound opened on the middle of the flight on the way back from visiting hers I posted a story on insta that I couldn’t sleep for the last 4 days but I thought I was gonna die. She saw the story and unfollowed. I tied reaching out but I only got blocked.

607,I want to commit suicide,"I’ve done nothing but try to put happiness out into the world and everyone and everything from the staff , realistically I still had that youthful but hopeful view on things , I genuinely wanted to pursue the happiness of myself and others . I’ve always been genuine and whole hearted to people yet I’ve always stayed “cool” sorta like one of those guys who are friends with people from being themselves and don't need to play it cool. it all started when I got to college, i'll skip a lot of what happened and get to the point where I got held at gunpoint, I called on a friend for a ride while I was able to get to myself, with the guy actively looking for me my friend showed me his true colors and disregarded my life and didn't come, later on I notice for no reason or basis to think so, my family thinks really little of me , they don't even like talking to me , they don't contact me unless they need someone like me around to indulge in whatever they're doing. there's not a single soul actually whom I've noticed actually enjoys talking to me. when I try talking to my family about my interests they almost make it obvious that they aren't listening, or i'll text them and they won't reply or anything however when they need me I'm always there, they often don't like having conversations on the topics unlike or any passions or interests as mine , the messages also seem to be about 6 words Mac from them unless they are talking of themselves and their own interests . I struggled with insomnia, depression and anxiety and that has caused problems in school and nobody seems to understand or show genuine care. my parents don't take it seriously. Later on I got to a point where I wasn't able to pay for school so I had to take a semester off and work hard to buy myself a car and to pay attention. I was putting money into a car I believed would be mine but my dad ended up giving it to my brother. , even when getting my own car I didn't get reimbursed. I get back to school and may not even be able to get financial aid .So I may be out another semester. then a specific relationship of mine is declining. I noticed after all this time she thinks so little of me for no reason. They talk to me less and less and show more interest in any opportunity that doesn't involve me and this happened because I took a semester off. I didn't have a car but they did and they said there was a problem because we never saw each other but I tried every chance I could to go see them even without a car but they wouldn't make that effort for me . they never use my Christmas gifts and only show off the most expensive one, they never seem to realize how hard I care for them and always view me as the enemy or always upset , when I'm going through I have to deal with it alone because people say ""idk how to be there for people"" or they don't even acknowledge things. She is perfectly fine with going 10 hours to a full day without talking to me with ) explanation on what she's been up to and doesn't like telling me about her day. things were good but the fact that she views me to be so bad because I'm going through what I am . She thinks guys should just be able to handle anything. seeing as that one cares. She holds me to every stereotypical male standard. and even though she doesn't like talking to me she straight up ignores me. and at a point wouldn't even acknowledge my compliments, when I saw her the first time in 8 months she didn't even smile or get happy . She said hey and we sat in silence in the car. I try so hard for everyone and I genuinely don't know what's going on. when I ask her for more affection, when I ask her what's wrong ,when I try to get close she gets mad and doesn't do any. however I try to be there for her no matter what and I'm always there when she needs me. My close friends from high school don't live near me anymore. On my birthday no one told me but a few family members but I'm always there for others birthdays .I try to give my girlfriend gifts that cater to her as well as trying to spend money on her, she doesn't do any of it for me unless it's Christmas or my birthday. She acts as if she hates spending time with me. It's gotten to the point where I have had no one to express myself to for months, no one to open up to, no one to relate to, no one to have casual conversation with. I've just been bottling everything and staying to myself lately but because of that , now I'm the ultimate ""mean"" ""jerk"" whose doesn't care for anyone but myself . which when all I've been doing is caring for others and myself. Even in trying to make new friends all they want to do is watch tiktoks, or be anti-social themselves. if I just want to sit in silence these days though I'm the bad guy. It's driving me crazy that I can't live my life happily. it's like this state is a curse or that I was destined to live this life. Not a soul considers how I experience life. I feel like I'm in a world full of people but I'm the only one I'll ever get close to. I've often been wondering why I exist. I don't see life changing anytime soon, I haven't given up but it all just seems dumb and pointless. I'm not kidding when I say I've tried to be as genuine and good to people but also not a push over by any means. It just seems weird to me . I'm losing hope for a lot of things. Im not saying im going to commit suicide but ive been considering what type of life comes for me after death, ive been praying alot lately. I just want to not experience it anymore. Even at the job I worked at to pay for school I was genuine and nice but they were racist . I'm not sure if it's because I live in Arkansas or what idk is why my life has become such a joke. I feel better off alone now but I hate to be alone. I live life in confusion wondering why I take so many Ls for the good that I do and put into the world . i haven't told everything going on but this is just the cut of it. I hate to say this, I really do but I hate living . and if I knew without a doubt what comes next. I have no reason to be here. This sounds cliche but I had true intentions to change the world for the better. I had a dedicated mindset to the better living of everyone on this planet in all aspects by any means. But it seems i was never meant to be close to anyone beyond myself

610,leaving an incompetent NP for a psychiatrist. really scared,"so! i’ve posted here once before about all that my NP did to me. in short: made me go cold turkey on meds i’ve been on for years while i was deeply suicidal, pushed me on new meds while in horrible withdrawal, and put me in hospital for medication and withdrawal induced mania and psychosis 

she ended up breaking up with me. yup, read that right. i told her i was in contact with my family doctor and she said she was “uncomfortable” with another doctor knowing what was happening. she did this only two days after i left the hospital. she also guilt tripped me over not doing enough for myself. said i should be inpatient. i agreed— she knew i went to the hospital the last time seeking emergency inpatient and was denied bc there’s no beds

anyway, she tried to call me and get me back. i said no. i’m paying out of pocket for a psychiatrist i see tomorrow

the thing is…i feel she’s ruined me. the idea of medication terrifies me. i see a med commercial with side effects and have a panic attack so bad i need valium. all i can think of is the side effects and interactions she never told me about that landed me in hospital

i know i need help. i’m severely depressed, i’m so anxious i have panic attacks in my sleep, and i’m lashing out at my family. but i’m so scared it’s gonna happen all over again, that i’m gonna get hurt and end up in hospital. that i’m gonna spend days vomiting and fainting and hallucinating bc a doctor didn’t check interactions

logically, i know that i just had a very bad NP. but i’m so scared the idea of seeing someone else and trying this all over sends me into a panic attack

611,I desperately need to forgive my husband and don't know how,"My husband and I have been together for 9 years. 7 years ago (2014), we bought a house on 10 acres that was supposed to be a 9 month gut job. As we demo'd, we realized the inspector had missed things and the house had major foundation and structural issues we were unaware of. With my dad's convincing, we tore down the house. My husband promised me it would be done by the time I graduated nursing school in 2016. That deadline came and went but I wasn't upset as we'd made very slow but steady progress for 3 years. That is, until in 2017 when the cost of getting HVAC was more than we could afford at the time. And that's where we've been stuck for the last 4-5 years. 

At the time the HVAC became an issue, I was working as a nurse, but my husband's income was about 3x what I made. The house is in his name only and he is the only one in charge of the financial aspect of the house. I lost my job about 3 years ago and haven't worked since (I've filed for disability). It has been a very rough 3 years for us mentally and emotionally. My husband is self-employed and I didn't know it at the time, but he got WAY behind on taxes during this time.  

We wanted to get a new construction loan when we ran into the HVAC issue, but our loan officer told us we couldn't. Last year, we found that we got wrong information from our loan officer and we can actually get a loan to finish the house. The problem is, in order to do that you can't owe to the IRS. He is almost caught up on taxes, but we will have to get the loan before the filing deadline in April because then we will owe again and won't be able to pay it off very quickly. 

The problem is that talking about the house is very emotionally triggering for me, but the conversations need to happen because the house has to be finished. I am trying to let go of the past and forgive him so I can be rational and engaged in the finishing process. I want to get this 7 year burden off our shoulders. 

He has apologized a hundred times. He has admitted he made mistakes, got in over his head, and failed us both. I don't know that there's anything else he can say or do at this point that will help me forgive him. 

I just feel like our lives have been in limbo for 7 years. I have never been able to truly settle in our current home. When we bought the house, it was exactly what we both wanted. I was 28 and thought by now, we'd have lived there for several years and have started a family. A lot has changed for me since then and I'm not even sure I want to live there. It's too far out of town and on a gravel road. Plus just the whole negative feelings towards this experience makes me think it would be better for us to sell it and find something else, like a fresh start. Then again, it would feel good to finally accomplish what we set out to do and I have to admit I don't truly know whether or not I'd like it unless we actually move there. 

I have also lost a lot of respect for him over this and don't know how to get that back, which is a whole other issue. 


Anyway, I am just looking for advice on how to forgive and let go so we can move forward on the house together. 

The things I hold resentment towards and need to forgive him for are: 

He didn't save up for the HVAC. 

He didn't pay his taxes. 

Feeling like he gave up on it and allowed this burden to hang over both of us for so many years 

Feeling like he set us back years by making poor decisions and not being proactive 

Feeling like I had no say or control over the situation (he would get defensive when I would ask about it or nag about the HVAC) 

Feeling like he stole my dream of what I thought our lives would look like today

I used to have goals that I had feelings towards but I guess I'm drained or maybe just depressed in general. I just keep asking myself what the point is to anything.  

I feel like I haven't been at peace with myself in awhile.. And the more I accomplish while feeling this way, the emptier I feel. Not to say I expect accomplishing things will instantly make me feel better from now on but I keep trying to keep myself busy but it still makes me feel off. So I feel terrible whether I do stuff or I don't. I probably feel slightly less terrible doing things but the vast empty feeling is still there. 

It's really to the point where I ask myself whether why anything matters from the point I wake up to when I'm at work, to when I do any hobbies to when I go to bed. I suppose these ill feelings pop up less when Im engaging with my loved ones or my friends but while I can be happy for them and the stuff they're doing, I really can't speak the same for myself.

I don't know what this new team is about, and I'm not familiar with a lot of things they've done because I was in a completely separate team. And I'm not that good at things either because I'm not that smart.

It's been such a horrible week. I have to attend meetings and talk to people and I feel like I'm out of my depth. I also feel that the people under me are much smarter than me as well.

My last advice to you all would be to not rush into things just because things seem alright. All throughout the past 5 years I've done so many stupid stuff when I was hyped up. It made me forget I was dumb and I'd just into things and miserably fail. Also, please don't listen to everyone on getting_over_it.

I get that everyone has made mistakes with this pandemic and we're still learning a lot about it.

Maybe it's easier for me to cope with this pandemic because I'm introverted and have already been dealing with one shitty health problem after another the past two years, so partially it's just ""oh hey, my life will continue to be limited and worse than I wanted it to be, and I spend most of my time alone anyway"". But on the other hand it is also making some of my health problems worse, along with not having much to look forward to.

But I also don't want to die or be left with more chronic health issues, I don't want my family to die or be hurt, and I don't want to infect someone else.

I have slight anxiety still and I guess a little depressed but I feel better. But I don't really have any motivation to do anything really. I can do it now through willpower I guess, but nothing really excites me enough to actually do it for fun. Should I still get a therapist?",1583146370.0

627,Need help getting over that my family hates me,"Long story short: My alcoholic stepdad was abusive to my disabled brother and I.  Because I stood up to his abuse, he turned my brother from the scapegoat into the golden child so then I was the new scapegoat.  He spread hateful lies about me to my family, so now my brother, sister, stepsiblings, all hate me.  They take family vacations to Disneyworld and exclude me.  Anytime I try to reach out and make peace, they twist everything I say into horrible things.  It's impossible for them to see me for who I am.  


I'm most upset about my relationship with my brother, because we used to be close.  I've tried reconnecting with him over the past 3 years, but sadly he's now picked up on my stepdad's traits and only plays mind games with me. When I wished him a merry xmas, he told me I was being manipulative.  I told him I was upset that he was friends with a teacher who sexually harassed myself and 5 other girls from our school (and was fired for it), he told me I'm trying to control his relationships.  Anytime I miss my brother and try talking to him, he hurts me so much that I sink into a deep depression for a week where I spend every day crying.  


Basically, I don't know how to get over my family hating me.  I don't know how to get over my broken relationship with my brother.  Whenever I think about any of this, I believe ""well I must be a horrible person if my entire family hates me, I must be an evil person if my own brother who was my best friend wants to hurt me so badly"".

628,I'm creating a routine.,"I have PTSD, BPI, Anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. I've been doing poorly for months now after the passing of both of my dogs. I've gotten more sleep in the past six months than I would get in a normal year. I'm depressed, an addict, and I drink too much soda and eat improperly, so I'm overweight but anorexic.

Today I ate an apple, drank a bottle of water, and exercised (plus meds lol). I'm going to try and make that my routine. In about two hours I plan on showering, a hurdle I need to face and conquer. I would do it now but I'm having... bathroom issues. lol 

I'm planning on straightening my hair afterward and putting on makeup, as well as shaving my legs which look like a freaking Hobbit's leg (IMO).

635,"[22F] I can't find a job and I'm feeling worthless, lost in life","I graduated with a Masters last November, and I've been back home for two months after an internship abroad. I moved back to my parents' and I started looking for a job right away. I sent several applications and never got any answer, not even for an interview. There are few offers being published and I'm really starting to feel hopeless. I received my diploma last week and it didn't even make me feel happy... 

It all got even worse when I contacted a friend from my class who told me that all the others in my Masters had either found something interesting quickly, or had their internship turned into a real job.  I was unable to achieve that as the place I interned at wasn't legally allowed to turn my position into a full-term one. Finding out about this really crushed me. We all have the same qualifications and yet I'm the only one who is unable to make it. I feel so worthless and I'm beginning to think that there is no future for me. I can't stop wondering ""what if this situation becomes permanent and I become a useless member of society forever?"". This keeps me up at night and gives me headaches...

I also feel guilty as I'm a burden to my parents who helped me a lot financially while I was studying, even though they're not rich. They're also still supporting me even though at my age I should be becoming independent. All the effort they made was useless, and I feel really bad about that. I'm disappointing them and it makes me feel so sad, even though I don't show it to them. 

For now, my only hope is the plan I have to join the army. The tests are in June and I've been training for them. I've been going to the gym quite a lot. I want to continue as it is the only thing that prevents me from freaking out, and that could be a way out of my shitty situation...

636,"""Healing"" burnout - I'm trying hard to ""get over it,"" but I feel like my sanity is hanging by a thread","Hi everyone. So, I [posted here a couple weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/aqa4yl/im_in_desperate_need_of_healing_after_mental/) when I was in the midst of a mental breakdown. I thought I was making progress, and maybe I am, but today is definitely a ""bad day.""

I have anxiety, depression and PTSD. I'm a chronic people pleaser. My anxiety has been destroying, or about to destroy, every element in my life it seems. After my anxiety flare up a couple weeks ago, which almost broke up my boyfriend and I, I decided that enough was FINALLY enough and that I'm going to do everything I can to keep my life together.

I see a counselor and a psychiatrist regularly. I have medicine both for longterm maintenance and for when I'm having panic attacks. I exercise (I haven't been able to recently, though, because I sprained my ankle). In the last couple weeks I have begun using healing crystals and essential oils. I've been hanging out with friends. I went to a gathering with new friends. I've been trying to keep a healthy diet, and to get in bed at a decent hour.

But probably most of all, I've been trying to change my thinking patterns. I try to catch each negative thought. I try to turn it around. I've been putting effort into this like I never have before.

Here's the problem: I feel like ""policing"" my thoughts is driving me more crazy. I second guess a lot of my thoughts, because thinking negatively is so natural to me. Many times, **I don't know if what I'm thinking is reasonable or not. I don't know if I should act on what I'm thinking, or say anything about it, because I don't know if I have valid feelings or if I'm just ""being crazy.""** Can anyone relate to this? This happened to me last night when I was hanging out with my boyfriend ... I just froze and sat there, because I was having an inward argument with my thoughts: ""Do I say I'm not feeling good? Do I even have a legitimate reason to not feel good? What's the non-crazy way to approach this?""

Does any of this make sense? Has anyone been there?

More and more I'm daydreaming of quitting my job, selling my crap and traveling the world (and figure out how to sustain myself while doing so). I feel incapable of living a ""normal"" life. I can't do a ""normal"" job or have a ""normal"" relationship without regularly having a meltdown like this. I feel like I'm such a people-pleaser that I should just swear off people pleasing for good and only live for myself.

Any comments are appreciated. Thanks.",1551284220.0
637,I legitimately don’t understand how much control I have over my own emotions.,"I’ve told my counselor before that I don’t understand how much control I have over my own emotions. Like I don’t know how much sadness is directly part of my life circumstances and a healthy reaction and is therefore something I can control and how much has to do with some chemical in my head whose imbalance will make me sad no matter how good my life is. He seemingly didn’t know how to respond. Can ANYBODY respond to this question?

I’ve been on and off different antidepressants for the past two years with no consistent success; if anything, much of the time they’ve made things worse.

I’m pretty sure I have a pretty healthy lifestyle. Sure, I smoke weed maybe a couple times a week and I will binge drink alcohol once every two weeks or so, and I eat fast food a decent amount of times per week. I drink around 3ish cups of coffee per day (some people might even say caffeine should help fight depressed type feelings). But that’s the extent of the “potential causes” I can think of.  I have a pretty healthy social life, I workout, I try and eat my vegetables, I drink plenty of water, I take my multivitamins, I take fish oil, I take magnesium supplements, I get good sleep...and yet I still get like this. I just end up demotivated and lying on my couch looking at my phone, switching between Reddit and other social media for hours and hours, shooting down every idea for something I could go do that enters my head and I just hate everything.

Is this my fault? Is this my brain’s fault? I don’t know. I just wanted to vent somewhere sympathetic.",1550370998.0
638,I think I'm going to be alright!,"I've been posting a lot recently about my depression and how I don't see myself beating it, but I think I'm going to be alright eventually. I hung out with an old friend today and he unknowingly forced me to actually do something I was meaning to do for a while now. And that is when I realized that I don't really give a shit if I'm a failure or if I'm not doing that well. It is just the depression that I want to get rid off. I know that I can do well if I get over my depression. 

I know it won't be easy to get over my depression, but I just need to make sure that during these periods of motivation, I need to focus on stabilizing my life by getting on top of my work. Usually I focus on socializing during these one or two ""good"" days but that never really helps because while socializing is important, what really messes me up during my bad days is the feeling of not being able to do simple assignments. I'm hoping that if I can start working on these assignments during my good days, I can prolong my good periods and the plan is that eventually these good periods will be 100% of the time. I also acknowledge that there will be bad times where I'll probably feel horrible.

This wouldn't be possible without the help of everyone who liked/commented on my posts. I try to help people sometimes as well, but it really does take a lot of time to truly put yourself in the shoes of the person you are helping which I felt that everyone who commented on posts did. It is great that everyone who comments tried to put a positive spin on the situation which I think is really important in getting better and I hope this community continues to remain positive and sets the standard for what a mental healthy related community should be like.

640,I got over it!,"In my post about a month ago I talked about my friend's betrayal of me and how it had crushed me inside. I was empty and full of self loathing, which was a surprise given how positive I am about most things in life. I know many people who can deal with negative emotions well, but because I'm fairly adept at ignoring my negative emotions, the depression hit me like a sack of bricks when it got triggered by the events.

I'm not going to go into details about the incident, because the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it/comments/9uimfg/how_do_i_get_rid_of_my_emptiness_and_hatred_of_my/) can do that for me, but I will say that I experienced ups and downs in recovering from it. What I didn't write is that after my feelings of self-pity subsided, I was left with an unimaginable hatred for my friend. I would come home to try to relax after a stressful day of work, and he'd be there at every turn, with the girl who was involved in it all. I cook to unwind, but they were literally always in the kitchen, even after I'd specifically told him I needed time away from both of them.

What I didn't focus on was everything else that was going badly in my life - and yet I was wondering why I had so much internal anger. Because I was working for about 11 hours a day (not including 2 hours commuting), I barely had any time to unwind. I would come back stressed, and then be further stressed by everything else. I didn't even have time to go to the gym as regularly as I wanted, and when I did, I was too stressed to lift well. I started smoking weed in the evenings and waking up groggy after getting little-to-no sleep, and I spent what dwindling free time I had on mindless pursuits like Netflix or video games.

The point is, we as humans can only take so much, and when it builds to breaking point, we blame the last straw rather than the hay-bale. When I finally realised this I handed in a Mitigating Circumstances Form to my university and took two weeks off work. I spent the time meditating, eating incredibly healthy food, cooking (at hours when my friend wasn't around), and going to the gym every day. I lost an entire kilo by focusing on my passion of nutrition and exercise, and felt **so** good for it. I haven't been stronger, or in better shape. Every time I felt angry I would meditate. I even did some interpretive dance to Tibetan meditation music (although nobody will *ever* know). I slept 8 hours a night. I spoke to my friend truthfully and regularly. I kept him updated on how I was feeling and what I was doing. And while he didn't really have much to offer during that period, it was good to know he was at least there to listen. This wasn't about my ego, this was about putting me in a better place.

Now, I know not everybody here has the luxury of being able to take two whole weeks off their life, but honestly, even if I could only have had a day or two here or there, I think I would have been better off. My mistake was treating my free time like time to waste, rather than time to improve. We recharge when we rest in a productive manner, and if we spend mindless energy on drug use, endless masturbation or even just watching TV, then we're not going to find the right outlet for improving ourselves, or better yet, getting over it.

I love my friend, and I support him and his girlfriend. My time-out gave me the perspective of a third party when I needed it most, and the space to foster a sense of self-worth. I'm still painfully single, but it's something I'm working on. I still have doubts, and I still get annoyed at my friend, but you take the good with the bad, and I wouldn't change it for anything in the world.

**For those with more minor issues than me:** *actually do something about it, it's a manageable and worthwhile use of your time.*

**For those with more substantial/difficult issues than me:** *I hope this post acts as a small beacon of hope for you in your dark times. You CAN pull through, and I (along with the rest of this subreddit) are rooting for you. Godspeed and good luck.*

P.S.  Meditate, get some goddamn sleep, get a hobby, exercise, and eat like a human that deserves to live (*vegetables* **dumbass**). Or at least do one of those. They work.",1545270526.0
641,I fell in love with a compulsive liar five years ago and I am still rebuilding myself from the psychological damage this experience has caused me. (Long story),"  

A little bit of background before I hop into the story. I am a 28 year old transman who at the time this story took place was just lesbian. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, gender dysphoria, and unspecified personality disorder (working on specifying that). I admit this so you as a reader can understand my precarious mental state that at the time that was largely misdiagnosed and untreated. I have been trying for the past few years to write this story down. I feel like it changed an integral part of who I am and how I see the world. 

About 5 years ago I started working at a Casino in my home town. I remember her on my first day of training. For the sake of anonymity, let's call her Jessica. Jessica walked into the conference room on the third floor offices that we were utilizing and my gaze instantly was set on her. She was mid-30s, short, blonde, large chest, and an otherwise small build. She carried herself like she knew she was beautiful. I wasn't the only one. The other men in our training class were instantly drawn to her as well.

My first impression was of older version of a preppy high school drama queen. Always needing to be the center of attention. I tried to ignore her, but over the course of our training week, I found myself being more and more compelled to be around her. Jessica was sweet, inclusive, open minded, and seemed like a genuine sweet heart. Her love of country style, Jeeps, and all things rhinestone was charming. I grew up as sort of a social outcast during my high school years (band geek, anime club, goth kid) and being only 23 at the time I was pleasantly surprised to find that my original assessment of her personality was harsh and judgmental. We became friends.

A few months later into our time together at this place of employment I had begun to develop a crush on her. I denied the attraction at first because of the age difference and of course I believed that she was so far out of my league. Eventually though, I couldn't deny it any more. I found myself seeking her company more and more. Her presence was somewhat intoxicating. She always knew what to say to make me laugh. She made me feel included and a part of the IT crowd at work.

One day, we were walking around the casino floor and she admitted to me that her and her best friend and fooled around and that she considered herself bisexual even though she was married. This shocked me as she had always talked about her husband in a positive light and they seemed so in love based on what I had heard. Around this time I also heard a few of our other coworkers mention that Jessica had told them that she and her husband were swingers. She never mentioned this to me and I brushed it off as being a dumb rumor.

Not much time later we were outside smoking getting ready to start our shift. She had come in that night looking deflated. When I asked her if anything was wrong, she insisted that she was fine. After a few moments of silence she asked me what I would think of her if she were to go on a date with another man that wasn't her husband. Shocked, I merely asked why she would want to cheat. She sighed, and in a quiet tone said that she found out that her husband had been cheating on her with a younger woman. She said that a guy who worked in a different department had been flirting with her recently and that she wanted to go out with him as revenge on her husband. My advice at the time was not to do it. I don’t believe in cheating.

A few days later she admitted to me that she had went on a date with the guy from work, I will call him DJ. DJ was an older man in his 50s, thin muscular build, and had always been nice to me on those occasions when our work paths had crossed. Jessica said that she had fun on their date and was expecting another one in the near future. DJ seemed to have a new spring in his step and I often found them talking at work. I never mentioned Jessica to him, and he never brought her up with me. We didn't talk unless it was business related. I should also mention that his son and his son’s girlfriend also worked with us at the casino.

A few weeks after this dating had started, Jessica began telling me that DJ's son and the girlfriend were treating her badly because they didn't approve of the relationship, although I never witnessed any negative behavior or heard any comments on the subject. Jessica also began to tell me that her husband wasn't just cheating on her with a younger girl, but that the girl was 17 and now was pregnant. Her husband and she had filed for a divorce because of this situation. She was really upset about it. I did my best to offer condolences while trying not to be secretly happy that she wasn't going to be married anymore. I also felt a little regret as I had wished to myself before that she wasn't married and would be free for me to admit that I liked her.

I'm not sure exactly when during this part of everts I decided to admit to her that I liked her, but I remember the conversation. We were walking on the floor together and we were talking about famous women we thought were sexy. Our topic veered off course and landed on women in general that were attractive and I looked her straight in her blue eyes and said, ""You."" She stopped walking for a moment and looked at me knowingly, and said thank you. We continued walking and I confessed that I had been harboring a sort of secret crush on her for a while now, but with all the crazy she was going through, I didn't want to tell her. She simply smiled and said she was flattered. After this, I constantly was checking to see if she was hinting at all to any sort of reciprocated feelings. I started paying attention to who she was talking to. I was constantly doing checks to see if I was in the area if she would choose me to talk to over her other friends. I would catch glimpses of her and try to notice if she was looking at me, or looking for me.

I will admit this is when I started to get a little obsessed. I never actually followed her around. I would just look for her as I was walking around or to predetermined locations for my job. I was always trying to catch her at lunch, on break, or before or after work just to try and spend a little more time with her. I never followed her home. I never sent her inappropriate messages, and I usually tried to let her initiate conversation because I was trying to determine the frequency at which she preferred my company to others.

This didn't go to plan however as half of the time she was either enamored with DJ or talking to her other work friends. I found myself extremely jealous and annoyed at how popular she was. I harbored a deep dislike for DJ and avoided him whenever possible because I hated the reminder that she was with him and had chosen him to cheat on her husband with.

A few months later, Jessica started to come to work acting extremely frightened. She said people had been following her. She didn't know who but someone had been behind her all the way to work. And it wasn't the first time it had happened. She lives in the country on a large farm ran by her husband. Work was on the outskirts of the town I lived in, but took her around 20 minutes to drive to from her house so she would be able to tell of someone was following her or just taking the same route as her. I offered to drive her home, she refused. I offered to follow her home to make sure she got there safe and so she had a witness to any vehicle other than mine following her so she could report it, and she refused. She did accept my offer to walk her to her car after work and wait for her every day before work and walk her to her door. So that what I did. Every day I would escort her from the building to her car and fro her car to the building. It quickly became a routine I enjoyed. It meant I was guaranteed to be able to have some one on one time with her. During all of this, I never saw any evidence of people following her on her was in or her way out. She said they would always stop before they got to close to work and work had cameras in the parking lot.

Not long after this began, she started coming to me with stories about how DJ had started to become violent with her. I never saw any bruises on her face that she claimed were expertly covered with makeup. But she would divulge these horror stories to me every couple of days. I told her to dump him and if things continued to report it to HR and the authorities. She eventually agreed and came to work one day saying she had finally left him. About a week later, she approached me one night and told me DJ had been fired a few days before but he was at the casino now harassing her. I had her point out the direction in which she last saw him and advised her to head back of house where he didn't have access. I found him near where she said and he looked ragged. He hadn't shaved in a few days and his clothes were disheveled. He noticed me before I could slip back away. He walked up to me and asked in a hurried tone where Jessica was. I said she wasn't available, and asked I could help him instead. He asked me to find her and request she give him his house key back. I agreed and had him wait where he was. I made it about 20 feet before my boss, a Security Supervisor, pulled me aside and asked what DJ had wanted. I told him that Jessica and broken up with him recently and that he was asking for his house key back. I also told him that she seemed frightened that he was there and was potentially bothering her. He called IGC (the Gaming Commission, basically a form of state police that handle matters regarding gambling and events that happen on casino property). DJ was shortly thereafter escorted of the property and told he was permanently evicted. I saw the eviction notice a few days later as we keep binders in all people not allowed inside the casino.

I was happy that the DJ drama was over with, but in the coming weeks Jessica had developed a new problem. Cancer. She told me that she had been having hearing problems on her left ear, and headaches, and seizures, and after some tests they had found a tumor in her brain. I was devastated. I was scared. I offered to be there for whatever she needed. Btw, she was still being followed by an unknown entity and her divorce was still pending.

It was during this time that I started keeping a journal of everything that she was telling me. This journal also included letters that I would write to her, although I never gave them to her. I was writing constantly during these days. I wrote her poems and I did give her few of those that I thought would make her smile. They did. She always got teary and hugged me tightly after giving her poems or other sweet sayings. Shortly after this. Her chemo started.

I was worried and yet this is where the red flags started making themselves known to me. Though she said she was going through multiple doses of chemo, she never missed work and never appeared sick, nor did she lose any weight that I could outwardly see. She said she had been sick and couldn't eat much during these times, but since she had never eaten at work I never saw a change in behavior. Also, another weird thing I noticed is that no one was talking about it. At the Casino, you learn that it's almost worse than high school at being a giant rumor mill. People talked about other people all the time, about everything. Secrets were extremely hard to keep and almost always gained more and more erroneous details as they were passed around. Never did I ever hear another person utter anything about her illness.

I did ask her questions about her illness. I asked what type it was. She could never remember the exact name. I asked if it was operable, it wasn't. I asked how large the tumor was. She literally said melon sized. I asked if she was showing any results with chemo after a while, she said she wasn't.

It was also during this time that she told me her brother had moved into her house and her husband had moved in with his pregnant young girlfriend who I learned had her own apartment at such a younger age. It was during this time that her brother was living with her that she told me her husband, divorce still pending, had begun to harm her physically whenever they would meet to discuss their daughter and other matters outside a lawyer’s office. I again never saw a bruise on her face or evidence of any physical harm.

During all of this, I was still sending her poems, and escorting her to and from her vehicle, and I was extremely aware and jealous of anyone she spent her time with other than me. It got so bad at this point that I started to doubt whether she had been lying to me about things. I didn't want to not believe her, especially if she really did have cancer, but some of it wasn't adding up. There were some days that tried to cut ties with her. I wouldn't speak to her, and avoid her at work. She would wait a few hours and then approach me and ask me what's wrong, and I just couldn't hold my anger in her presence. I would always instantly be enamored with her again. It was constantly back and forth of loving her and hating her. I was also scared to ask anyone else about my doubts because I didn't want come across as not believing her, or spreading rumors about her. I also think I was secretly afraid that my doubts were true. I wanted to believe her so badly.

I began to experience a sort of delusion. I’m not sure when it exactly started, but I believed it so much that I based a lot of my decisions during this time on this delusion. I believed that I was repeating periods of time because I was failing to be with her. I believed we were destined to be together and the universe was making me repeat months of what seemed like hell every time I would fail. This is where time frames become a little fuzzy for me. I was extremely paranoid that I was failing, that she was lying, and that she would turn me in for harassment at work (although I did ask her on multiple occasions that if anything I ever did made her uncomfortable or if she wanted me to stop making advances to just tell me and I would stop immediately. I constantly asked her if I made her uncomfortable. She always denied that I did and said she had feelings for me as well).

At one point she said she started radiation on her brain tumor. She even showed me a small bald patch on the nape of her neck behind her right ear where those pesky baby hairs that grow were absent. However, there was no other hair loss. Ever. Again, no signs of sickness that I could see and she still never missed work.

Shortly after this, starting to feel completely crazy with the back and forth I was feeling between hating and loving her, I finally went and talked to my doctor about being put back on medication for bipolar disorder which I had been diagnosed with a few years earlier (It has since been revoked as an accurate diagnosis and replaced with unspecified personality disorder). It was the first time I ever was on medication for it. I didn't go to therapy, but my doctor did start me on a regime of medications that made me jumpy, erratic, and unable to sit still. I was only on this for a few months before I stopped taking the medications. They weren't helping with the problem and I couldn't stand how I felt on them.

It was at this point that Jessica said to me that her husband told her he never had a pregnant girlfriend. Apparently it had come out during the divorce proceedings. She was adamant that they were close to their divorce finalizing. With a date set for all that nonsense to be over, I decided to ask her officially out on a date and she what she said. Up till this point we had never spent time together outside of work. I would offer but she always had an excuse as to why she couldn't attend.

We used to play this game that came out during that time on gun wrappers. It was Truth or Dare on FIVE gum. I decided to buy a blank pack and write my own truth or dare. It said, ""Truth - would ever consider going on a date with me? Dare - I dare you to go on a date with me."" I slipped her the piece of gum with the custom wrapper on day at work and instantly her face light up and she said yes and hugged me. I was over the moon. I immediately began to plan the most extravagant date I had ever planned. It was useless though, as months went by and we could never settle on a day when she was free. She always had something going on. On top of that, she kept telling me that her husband kept postponing the court date for their divorce.

Finally after a year and a half of knowing her, I decided I had had enough. I switched jobs at work which limited my contact with her. I started dating a different girl who had been crushing on me for a while. I liked that she knew she liked me. She was easy to talk to and I never once questioned whether she had ever lied to me. We got engaged and I seemed to start to feel better. I still had feelings for Jessica and often thought about her. I was angry at myself every time I felt this though, and eventually started seeing a therapist. This of course caused problems with my fiancé. I was in therapy for about a year, making slow progress if any, when my fiancé decided enough was enough and left me. I spiraled. I have since been working on a proper diagnosis (it took three hospitalizations for something to happen), and I am coming to terms with my mental state and working to improve it. I realized that though I loved my fiancé, I was not in a place that I could truly be in love with her. We are still friends to this day, though there is always and will probably always be a bit of tension between us. I regret taking so much of her time and I appreciate that she loved me. I am sorry that I broke her heart.

Recently though, I had to switch back to my old job and Jessica and I now work together again. We aren't like we were though. I still struggle with feelings for her, but I don’t look for her everywhere I go. I don’t talk to her most days and I feel like things are as okay as they can be. I have found out though that she never got a divorce from her husband as they are still married. A mutual friend found out about some of the situation through my fiancé and she said they had never filed for divorce and as far as she knew were and have always been a great couple. Also, this mutual friend said she is pretty sure Jessica's brother never lived with her.

I have since thrown out my journals detailing this confusing time in my life and have started to wonder how much of it I imagined. I really felt paranoid and crazy during this time. I am still working on some personal issues in therapy and I am making progress. It's been five years now since Jessica first walked through that door in the conference room on training day. I now find it extremely hard to trust other people. I am currently looking for a new job at a different company. Hopefully, one day I can put this all behind me. ",1544132766.0
642,Going to a concert/fundraiser for one of my favorite musicians who committed suicide not too long ago,"I had a mental breakdown when I went to school in Brooklyn, and I've mostly recovered from it about 3 years later with some serious help from a psychiatrist and a counselor.

I listened to Frightened Rabbit religiously when I was deep in the mire that is depression, and around the time I finally started to show signs of remission, the lead singer was found dead, jumped off a bridge. I was devastated by that... one of the only bands I felt I truly resonated with.

There's a concert being held by musicians who are going to sing some of his songs in Brooklyn tonight and I'm going. Going back into the city again causes a lot of anxiety and pain in the immediate sense, but I know I should go to this because I am holding something back, I'm not talking or writing about my grief, and I think this show tonight may help.

Overcoming anxiety to overcome grief to overcome depression, a strange equation tonight. I feel like shit in the moment but I know it's the right choice.

Here's to exposure therapy my dudes

&nbsp;

*edit*:

 Being in the city was hard, but I can see clear evidence of it somehow getting easier every time I try. In regards to the concert, it was really amazing, but I kind of felt numb while there. I loved the crowd and the musicians, it was all great, but I think I went in assuming I would feel some immediate catharsis or ""cure"" my grief immediately. While I did tear up a bit, there's still this pain in me that I can't really explain. I just feel the process is clearly not over, but this was very much a step in the right direction.

It's important to measure yourself after you take enormous steps like these, so while I don't feel an immediate feeling of rejuvenation or healing, I can tell through my actions and my decisions that I am getting better, bit by bit. Those small changes can be hard to see, so you have to look very closely for your own sake. Don't let big changes go unnoticed.

 Thanks for the kind words. If you'd like to hear any of the concert [here's the playlist of all the songs I recorded, and my favorite song they performed that night, Nitrous Gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATH8Dg0QnO8&list=PL8dlI1QkMxjtl71Rp-dLxuEKm2e0E37AH&index=8&t=0s)",1544046645.0

I haven't had a job, nor have I had any hobbies or done anything I love, in years. I lost almost everyone in my life by withdrawing from the world. I forgot how to take care of myself, how to cook and clean and manage basic stuff. I forgot how to look nice and put together and not like I've been laying in bed for days. I no longer have any clothes that fit because my weight changed so much, so I don't really have anything to wear to go out in public. I have to rebuild my life from scratch. I am ashamed of myself.

651,I made my way out of depression,"The first time I've experienced some depression like symptoms was when I was 16 and again with 17. It wasn't for a long time and I managed to bounce back to normal after a while so I didn't make too much out of it. But when I moved out with 19 and was under a ton of stress for months I didn't bounce back anymore. And it got so bad that I ended up in hospital with the diagnosis of severe clinical depression. I don't want to make this too long so I'll keep it short with my background. Fucked-up family with tons of different issues, let it be mental health, physical health and what not, 3rd child of five, moved basically after every two to three years and experienced some forms of child abuse. I'm 21(male) and I've been feeling better for a month or so now. I got from wanting to kill myself and making plans to do so, to attending education, maintaining my social life, making plans for the future and just being able to enjoy being alive again.

We don't live under the right conditions anymore that would encourage us to do the things that make us feel good and live the life we are designed to. We live in a world that wasn't designed for healthy and happy people but for a functional society. Humans are designed to and are supposed to feel depression at somepoint of their life. But we are also supposed to bounce back with the help of a healthy lifestyle a strong social network/ family background and the right support. But with the knowlege what you need to do to feel good and how you have to change your life you can live a life closer to the life you are supposed to live and still be a part of this mad world we find us in today.

So long story short what I did basically was to do research on depression and what I learned was that the solution isn't antidepressants or what the healthcare system has to offer for this problem but a healthy lifestyle, the right nutrition and especially natural supplements that can correct the balance of chemicals in the brain that are responsible for our feelings. Because that's what it all is in the end. It's all chemicals. Every thought, every feeling is some form of hormone or biochemical reaction and if you don't give your body what it needs to have positiv thoughts/feelings it all goes downhill. Every depression is different just like every person on earth is different but what we have in comon is that we all need Serotonin and Dopamin too feel good and there are ways you can support your body to produce more of that. And then you have the energy and the vision to deal with the problems that have even led you to this point in the first place. These are the videos and the supplements that have helped me the most:

652,How do I differentiate between removing toxicity from my life and running away from my problems?,"**tl;dr -** The easiest way to deal with something that makes me miserable is to avoid it. How do I tell when that's a healthy behavior and when that isn't? 

I've never really dealt with problems well. Maybe it comes from years of self-worth issues, but my default response to something that hurts me is - if I can, I'll try to accommodate it, especially if it's another person; if I can't, then I'll just get it out of my life.

Happens more often than I'd like - I have an inherently negative personality and I'm easily bitter or envious, so I find it hard to be comfortable in social situations. I'm especially guilty of doing this with relationships - more than once, I've ended up cutting off someone I liked because I couldn't deal with my own commitment and self-doubt issues. Self-sabotage under the guess of 'it'll be better this way,' really, but it's not much of a relationship when you're miserable half the time.

Most recently, I left a chat group of friends - mostly gamer buddies - I've known for a few years. What prompted this was one of the members talking about killing people and encouraging committing suicide. I'm sure it was meant as a joke, and I usually don't mind that kind of humor - I make a lot of jokes about death and killing myself, it's a coping mechanism - but I was having a particularly miserable day and the tone of the conversation (I can't stand people blaming others) legitimately 'triggered' me, for lack of a better word.

I don't know what I want to do. I feel bad for leaving friends over words - it was just the actions of one person I had a problem with, not the whole group, and I'm sure I could've dealt with it in a more mature fashion. As well, that person probably didn't realize it was an issue for me, since I make similar jokes. It's like self-deprecating humor - I'm fine with me making jokes about myself, but I'm not fine with other people making those same comments about myself. On top of all of that, I ... just don't really have any other friends, and I'm the kind of person who gets really lonely, needy, and awful without anyone to talk to.

At the same time, I think it might be a good decision to stay out of things entirely. The chat group itself has been really salty and toxic recently - in part my fault, because I'm pretty passive-aggressive and very bad at hiding when people get on my nerves - and it's definitely made me sad before.

I'm just sadder the other way around. Happens every time I end up cutting people out of my life - I tell myself it's for the better, but it really doesn't feel that way. I don't know if I'm actually doing myself a favor, or if I'm making things worse by trying to avoid facing my problems.

Not just a problem with this chat group - I liked someone recently, who I think gave up on me because I'd made it clear I didn't think I had the emotional stability to pursue a relationship. Ended up removing them from my life because it made me miserable to see them.

I just don't really know. I don't even have a question, really. Just lost and confused and looking for advice.",1489386878.0

657,How to stop shit talking to myself for every mistake I make?,"A lot of my shit-self talk come from small, seemingly insignificant incidents: About a week ago I wrote and posted something really embarrassing online. And after getting a couple of downvotes I deleted the post and started ruminated on that and all the stupid things I've done (or did not do) in the past. I felt like a whiny attention-seeker and feeling that I DO want a bit of attention made me feel even shittier. It took me a few days to get over it: I don't have anyone IRL that I can vent to (and wouldn't want to, anyway), so I use weekends as ""mental health days"" to go out, get some exercise, and recharge for the coming week.

But my feeling good and motivated somehow always goes crashing down very quickly - Sometimes it's due to more self-shit talk, sometimes from seeing how others are fairly in-control of their lives while mine is going nowhere. I'm a very slow and low-energy person - Two traits that I REALLY really dislike in myself but have been trying to accept. So I do everything slowly, but can't help feeling awful when someone else can do the same thing(s) quicker and more efficiently.

Just today I realized that I made a mistake at work by overlooking a detail from a few simple instructions - Which I normally move on from fairly quickly. But realizing that I do this crap **ALL THE TIME** filled me with a lot of despair, like I can't do anything right, ever.

663,How I believe I overcame depression. And hope that you could too.,"Short intro: I've been suffering from depression/fatigue all my adult life (10years).   
I've been out there, on the contemplating suicide stage. I've lost so much do to this suffering.  

I finally through much research, much struggling, and much hard work have beat this f'er into submission.   

Here's a short how: 
- Fixed my circadian rhythm  
- Found food allergies and fixed my stomach/colon  
- Supplementing deficiencies due to inflamed colon  
- Daily movement  
- Remove stimulants (These varies from supplements, surfing the web, porn, and other such things).  
- Removed toxic relationships  
- Quit drinking alcohol  
- Daily meditation  

A lot of those things go hand in hand, and a lot of it is about habit and addictive behaviour. 
Fixing all of those things are all a step in the right direction. Compounded it very very likely will, not just dull the ache, but remove it and bring back some feeling into your life again.  

I am actually at a place now, where I want to guide people out of the darkness, however, I don't know if or how I should do this. A couple of things are certain that I don't want to play doctor or miracle worker, and I don't want to make money on such a thing. Those of you who suffer probably know what I mean.  

The reason I post is two-fold. First is if my thoughts or methods can help just a tiny bit of suffering, then that would make me feel better. Second, when you teach concepts to someone, you learn it more yourself, therefore if I give a helping hand to someone it manifests my own results and understanding thereof and adherence to them even more.

667,"Depression's coming around for another visit, I think. I can hear it knocking on my door. But this time, I'll come prepared.","I don't want to bother everyone with my life's story. I've had a short but powerful bout of depression when I was 16 'till I was about 19. Sought refuge in drugs, tried to kill myself, ended up in the psych ward more times than I can count. Depression is a living, breathing thing; it comes and goes in waves. I said to myself last time: if this depression shit ever comes back again, I'm NOT going to give up like last time. I'm going to fight it with everything I've got, whatever it takes, I will keep on living and die an old, natural death.
 
I'm 21 going on 22 now. I'm much wiser and stronger now. I've got contacts. A psychiatrist, some therapists, a loving mother. I'm not going to roll over now.
 
This summer I'm going to take a trip. Take some money from my savings account, hop on my bicycle, pack my tent, and set off traveling. There's nothing in the world that makes you feel more free.

668,"I realized that I've had such a pessimistic perspective for so long, that I genuinely feel repelled by happy things.","I was diagnosed with depression in '08 and started medication, but I stopped after a few months. I should not have, but I did not want to become dependent upon it for the rest of my life-- not to mention the side effects. For years since then I've known that my depression still exists, but despite knowing that it is caused by imbalances in the brain I wanted to try and overcome it myself.

As stated in my title, I realized that I've reached a point where happy things just repel me. They seem fake and they feel foreign. For instance, happy songs, people who are always smiling, friendly attitudes, and any idea of going out with a group of people to have fun. I often wonder how people can be so happy all the time. How is that possible, to wake up and just be happy for no reason at all?

My significant other is the only one who makes me feel happy, but I feel that my negativity is subtly harming our relationship. I'm not cruel, but I'm certainly not a positive person to be around. I am often bitter or angry, and complain a lot about things in life that bother me.

To counter my negativity I always remember to say a positive thing soon after or later on in the day. I would like more ideas on what I can do to progress myself. It's difficult to break myself out of the way I am now, because the thought of being any other way just doesn't seem normal to me anymore.",1360734561.0
669,"I'm proud of myself for doing something I've been meaning to do for months, and it meant stepping way out of my social comfort zone.","Every year I go to a beginner's social dance lesson at my university, dance mainly with my friends, make promises to go back, and then I lose the motivation to continue. Tonight I went to a lesson not at my university, but at a church in the community - that is, the people present were not just students, they were mostly strangers, and they were not all beginners like myself.

I was super nervous about going, because I get anxious about any social event that involves more than just a couple of close friends. I have never been out to a bar or a club for these reasons. I am also incredibly self-conscious about dancing. So for me, this was a huge step because not only did I go out and dance in front of people, but I met strangers who had nothing in common with me.

As a beginner, of course I sucked sometimes. I messed up a lot and I wasn't familiar with most of the moves. I had socially uncomfortable moments, I tried embarrassing small talk, and I spent many a dance sitting awkwardly on the sidelines because I was afraid to ask someone to dance.

But the important thing is that I did it! I didn't stay home, I didn't cancel, I finally did this after months and even years of thinking ""I wish I actually got into this, because it's fun when I try it."" It was a lot scarier than going to the beginner's lesson at my university, and I certainly felt uncomfortable at times, but I did it. I even asked someone to dance towards the end. I am determined to go again in two weeks :)",1359176749.0
670,2 changes have made a big difference.,"**1.) More sleep!**  

I was stuck in an awful paradox for the last year or more.  I always felt unfulfilled and edgy at the end of the day, so I'd fight off sleep as long as I could.  Why?  So I could read *one more* article, so I could learn *one more* thing, so I could send write *one more* post, so I could finish *one more* page.  That ""one more"" thing would turn into 5, 10, 20 more things.  The one driving thought behind it was that I needed to feel fulfilled at the end of a long day, and I figured that learning or writing something important would do the trick.  Wrong!  The lack of fulfillment was because my lack of sleep was destroying my focus, and I wasn't enjoying my days the way I should.  I know that should have been obvious, but the fatigued mind is often an illogical mind.  Get enough sleep, every night, and you'll feel much better.  Recharging your batteries is essential.  Since I started getting 8-9 hours of sleep per night, my mood has improved greatly and I'm much more able to deal with potentially disruptive mood swings.

**2.) Go do stuff!**

Some of the best advice I've ever read was to do at least one thing, every single day, that gets you out of your comfort zone and provides a new experience.  It can be anything- learn a skill you didn't know before, strike up a conversation with a stranger, try a new bar/restaurant/hangout spot.  Even if you don't feel like it, push yourself into new situations.  It gets the heart going, it keeps your mind sharp, and it can be infinitely rewarding.  Today I didn't have any plans; instead of moping around about it, like I've done many times in the past, I tried to pack my day with as much activity as I could.  I went to a bunch of second-hand clothing shops I've never been to before, I tried a new coffee place, I had a conversation with a stranger at the store, and I did a bunch of cleaning around the apartment.  Instead of feeling empty, I feel like I had a pretty productive day.  I got some great T-shirts out of it, I had a great chai tea latte, I met someone I didn't know before today, and my apartment looks much better than it did this morning.  Plus, when I was cleaning I found a gift card that still had $26 on it!  Bonus.

Both of these changes are as obvious as can be, and anyone on the outside looking in would say, ""DUH,"" but apathy can make simple steps seem difficult.  They're not!  Push yourself to make some basic changes to your life, and you should start to feel a little better each day.

**TL; DR: Get more sleep, push yourself to get outside your comfort zone, and you might start to enjoy your life a little more.**",1341732189.0
671,Doing well with depression - except for girls. Help?,"So I'm 26. Have had depression since about, well, 10. Since highschool I have made some major strides in overcoming depression. Being diagnosed with Aspergers a few years ago actually was a great help because I felt less ... I suppose *responsible* would be an approximation ... for all the social gaffes and awkwardness over the years. I usually feel way better about myself and am far more competent socially.


There's one thing that still acts as a bullet straight to my heart: I've never had a girlfriend, or any sexual experience at all. I just don't understand how to deal with this. Anything can trigger this: the (extremely frequent) conversations about sex in my group of friends, a couple kissing on the sidewalk, a romantic couple in a movie ... any of this can send me into the horrible death spiral of depression. It's practically disabling sometimes.




I understand the whole ""You have to love yourself first,"" thing, but what do you do when the one last remaining obstacle, the elephant in the room that makes me unable to love myself, is that girls are completely impenetrable to me, and I'm pretty positive I'll die alone? And this emotion is a big reason that the girls don't like me in the first place? I have actually been rejected by girls specifically *because I was lonely*. What the fuck? If you were passing a man who was drowning, would you not throw him a life preserver *because he was drowning*?!",1333883714.0
672,One whole year later,"I went through the most awful breakup last year after my long term partner ended the relationship abruptly. We had plans to move across the country but he decided to move back to his hometown. He packed up his stuff while I was away at work and left without a word and ended things with me over a text. (I know, pretty awful) I decided to move across the country alone last spring. It was rough the first 3 months being in a new place and then thousands of miles away from my family and friends but one day in June I realized the breakup wasn’t as heavy on my heart anymore and I wasn’t sad anymore. I have dedicated myself to my studies and will be graduating next month from my higher degree program and I’m extremely proud of myself for completing this goal I’ve had for myself for years. 2 weeks ago, I found out my ex had a baby from snooping on Facebook. I definitely did this to myself lol. I think they grew up together in their small town and maybe dated in middle school and kept in touch on social media? We have been broken up for less than a year as of today and to know while I spent the first 3 months in a deep spiraling depression hole, he wasn’t hurting at all. It sucks knowing he moved on so quickly and literally started a family with someone new in less than a year. I don’t have the negative emotions as I did last year when we initially broke up and I can say I’m over him but for some reason, this hurts me. When I initially found out, my heart was racing and I called my best friend crying. After I got those emotions out, I thought I’d be less upset but I’m still upset. 

Has anybody been in a similar situation? 
I know I’m in a better place emotionally and everything fell into place and I have so many things to look forward to like moving into my dream home and starting my new position with my higher degree in June so why can’t I shake this off?

674,I feel like I can’t set goals because…,"Nothing has satisfied me since I graduated college in 2018. I’ve just felt bored with stuff. I try I really do. I’ve tried making games (which is what I went to college for) and it just felt boring. Like really, really boring. And when it wasn’t, it was frustrating. 

I then went on to try and learn 3D modeling, another interest of mine. I got the stuff done and felt very little. 

I’m currently working on a novel, and it’s not that I don’t have motivation or time, but that I feel extremely bored while working on it. 

I’ve tried practicing piano, which is a skill I’ve always wanted to learn. It also feels boring. 

I’m thinking of maybe going to school, learn languages, take courses. As I said before, the last time I really felt satisfied and good about my work was in school.  

I work out. I also work, 12 hour shifts 3 days a week. It’s not like I’m just sitting around idle. 

It’s just kind of a bummer to feel like nothing will bring me joy. Is there something I’m missing here? Do I just need to dig deeper and finish more projects? 

The real concern here is that I feel like I can’t set any career goals. I want to eventually be self employed. It’s a serious goal of mine I know can be obtained with hard work. But first I need to know what I actually want to do. 

I feel like I’m just missing a piece of my brain. I’m not getting the feedback part of this feedback loop. I do something I’m supposed to be proud of and feel nothing. 

I’m not trying to be overly negative, I’m actually quite hopeful for my future, just trying to find answers between therapy sessions (I start again soon yayyyy). 

I’m not necessarily depressed, I just feel like I can’t set a long term goal because everything short term feels so boring and meaningless.

682,Some thoughts on self-esteem and depression.,"I have recently entered a depressive episode. The last time I felt this depressed was \~10 years ago, during my final years at school. It lasted about 18 months or so. The 9 year period since the end of that episode hasn't been completely wonderful, but I generally felt that where my mood has been lower, my life-circumstances at the time legitimised that. But right now, on paper, I ought to be active and happy, but I'm miserable and sluggish.

I've been going to therapy for about a year. The main theme in my sessions has been a stubbornly low self-esteem that was instilled during a difficult childhood and adolescence. When I look back on my life, the periods during which I felt happiest were times during which my self-esteem grew and remained high. I had freedom to express myself, I was surrounded by people that were kind to me, doing things I enjoyed, and was good at.

The bout of depression I experienced 10 years ago started after an event at school that made me feel worthless and full of shame. Similarly, my current bout occurred after a school reunion that left me feeling insignificant and un-liked. It was like I'd time-travelled back to school. These two events, however, have led me to recognise that in my case, depression isn't something that *just happened* one day. It was caused by a real-life experience that **validated** a lot of the negative beliefs I've had about myself. A case of life's circumstances substantiating a deeply-held belief that I'm no good.

Recognising this has been a really positive experience. I don't see depression as causeless, endless, or hopeless any more. I know that I need to improve my self-esteem. That is something I can systematically and logically work towards, which is a wonderful feeling. It will mean working on things that will make me feel good (or, if not good, then less-bad), engaging with people that make me feel good. Similarly I can work much harder to maintain whatever self-esteem I do have. This will mean turning my back on people that make me feel bad, finally standing up for myself, and stopping doing the things that make me feel bad.

I suppose I'd never really thought of my self-esteem as fragile before. But now I see it as core to my wellbeing, something to nurture and stand up for, I'm excited to work hard at building it back",1644827571.0

684,I need advice on dealing with envy,"I'm realizing I'm a very envious person. Though it's important to note this doesn't manifest in any way other than in my own mind as I don't *act* envious, I only have envious thoughts when I'm alone.

I think that everyones lives are better than me and I'm filled with resentment towards the world outside of myself for the way my life has turned out. 

I am envious of anyone that had a loving family, or anyone that had caring friends, or a significant other.
I wasn't raised by a loving family, and I have never had any close friends, or a significant other, I feel lonely everyday.

I am envious of anyone who was born into money, they didn't even do anything but they were born into a wealthy family therefore they have more options than I ever will. Like most people, I have to work a job I don't like so I can afford to pay the overpriced cost of living. People born into money don't have to live paycheck to paycheck under immense financial stress all the time. 

I will be in a good mood but then I hear about someone being able to go on vacation with their family to another country. I'll never get to experience a family vacation, I'll probably never be able to leave my country. 

I hear about all the fun everyone else is having on their weekends while my only options for things to do is either 
A. Stay at home 
B. Do something alone

I cant remember the last time I actually had fun. 

How am I supposed to not be filled with so much jealousy when Im surrounded by people who have the things I desperately want, but also then take those things for granted? 

I was looking up advice for this and all I see is the same crap again and again. 
 I don't even use any social media, so please don't give me advice like ""stay off of social media"".

Pretty much everyone just says that I need to remember that other people have problems too, and that their lives aren't perfect, blah blah blah. At this point I feel like the people giving that advice are merely hopefully projecting that to make themselves feel better because while yes their lives aren't perfect, they most certainly are better than mine, and that's plain and simply a observable factual statement. How am I supposed to not be jealous of that? They get to have genuine smiles everyday while I've been miserable for the last 20 years? None of us did anything different, we were just born to different families in different places. They don't deserve what that have anymore than I don't deserve all the bullshit I've had to go through. 

It's not fair, and that's just how it is.

see, i'll be out of high school soon. i live in an area where the schools nearby aren't very good, so my parents both have to work multiple jobs so they can afford to pay rent in an apartment in the next town over so we can go to school there. this stress means i hardly see my dad on weekdays, and it means my mother is constantly stressed between taking care of three kids, returning to college online and working now. my mother also suffers from mild clinical depression, and has been on anti-depressants for several years now. and my mother has always had a little bit of a stress problem, and she has a tendency to let that out on me, the oldest of her children. as a result of this, i've been the victim of verbal and emotional abuse since i was about 12, and there doesn't seem like there will be any end to it until i leave home for college in 2 years.

being in a household completely surrounded by people who are constantly dealing with their own issues, i have no choice but to constantly just be ok. if i'm not ok, nobody can be. my younger siblings truly do look up to me, and if they see me distressed it will only bring them fear. nobody in my family knows that i'm nearly 100% certain that i suffer from depression as well, nobody is aware of the extent to which i'm affected by my GAD, (generalized anxiety disorder) and nobody knows how alone i feel most of the time. i truly don't have a single person in my life that i can truly open up to, and i've taken to using escapism and bottling my emotions.

I have been distant friends with him for the past four years because we’re both busy and at different schools far apart. Due to covid we both ended up back in our home town and started spending a lot of time hanging out. 

I had a huge crush on him in high school and the more we hung out and talked I started to get feelings again. I had once told him I “liked” him in high school and he was just silent. Super awkward. So I didn’t want to put myself out there again. 

But one weekend we were supposed to go camping with another friend who bailed. The first night we lay next to each other slowly inching closer. He reached out for my hand and I melted. We hooked up both nights we were camping. We also talked and hung out but never about feelings. 

A week later he left to move to another city. I hadn’t started working yet so I offered to visit him. I drove to his house and spent half the week there. The first night he offered me to sleep in the living room, the couch or his bed. So I said his bed. I stayed there for three nights and we made out or had sex every night. 

After that I left but we talked everyday. Until he left on a trip where he didn’t have any service. So I didn’t talk to him for two months. Once he came back I happened to be in the town he lived in visiting a different friend, so we met up. We talked for a couple hours and then I left. I had been driving myself mad over the past two months because before he left I asked “what are we?” and there was no resolution. 

Finally I texted him and told him I had romantic feels for him and wanted to know how he felt. He replied that he cares about me but is busy with life and doesn’t have any romantic feelings. After spending so much time with him and talking to him I was crushed. 

I cried myself to sleep the first night because I felt sad and stupid and hurt. It’s been a little over a week now and I still have all of these sad and angry feelings. And I want to talk to him about them cause he is my good friend but I can’t cause he is the cause of them. I still love him as a friend and don’t want to lose that. But I also have to protect myself and feelings.

How do I move on from this? Can I still be friends with him? I keep hoping that if we stay friends someday he’ll realize he made a mistake. Will these feelings ever straighten themselves out and/or go away? What should I do?",1600060840.0
692,A repeating To Do list of Chores I use for motivation,"I keep a repeating To Do list of Chores to motivate me. I've found this to be extremely helpful for me. It helps me take better care of myself. The more chores I do each day, the more optimistic I feel about my life. And the more chores I do, the more motivation I have to do more chores. I would recommend every one who wants to be more productive to try it for a few months. It's hard at first but gets easier with practice. And when I do ignore the list, I always end up regretting it.

I tend to get more of the boxes done on the weekends. I have boxes labeled ""Chore 1"" and ""Chore 2"" for miscellaneous chores that don't come up every day, like grocery shopping or meal prepping.

Some of the columns are pretty self explanatory: make bed, workout, shower, brush teeth. Others are more interesting. There's one for ""service"" which means I tried to do something nice for someone. There are two for ""Social"" because the more social I am, the more friends I make. There's one for personal finance. One for ""Study"" which is short for ""Study for my career (programming)"". There's one labeled ""Practice"" which means ""Practice programming outside of work"". There's one labeled ""Clean"" which just means spend any amount of time cleaning, usually the bathroom or bedroom or kitchen but it could be clothes. On a previous sheet, I had a column for Courage, as in ""Do something good for you challenges you to go outside your comfort zone"".

I'm a big believer that if you have a goal you should work on it a little bit every day.

694,My best friend is (most likely) going through a depression after a break up. Can you help me help her?,"My friend (f31) had her whole future planned out with her (now ex-)boyfriend (m33). He suddenly, VERY suddenly, decided to end the relationship back in januari. It came out of nowhere, and he refused to tell her why, until maybe a month later, when she often asked him why. During that time, his arguments for breaking up got more severe with each passing moment, up to the point where he told her mother she was bullying him. Now, I know my friend can have a strong opinion in stuff, but she would NEVER intentionally bully someone. And she is very open minded, so if you don't agree with her, that's fine too. 
Now, my country has been in so-called ""intelligent lock-down"" (not my title for it, that's what the government calls it) sinds half way march. She finally got answers, when we were generally ordered to stay home. Ever since then, she has been going in a downwards spiral. 

Now, I'm no stranger to severe depressions myself, having been diagnosed with it twice in the last ten years. No attempted suicides, but jumping off my 4 story building at that time looked tempting. But for me it was mostly because I had no more energy or happiness to do anything anymore. I failed in everything I did, so why would any next step I'd undertake go better? What helped me through, and that was for me personally (but I emphasise: that worked for me), was therapy. I went through a lot of therapy talking about my social anxiety, fear to fail, constant state of unhappiness. 

I really REALLY want to help her, but I oddly enough, I don't know what to do. What would you want out of a friend? Out of family? I don't seem to recall what I wanted myself. It seems to be sort of vanished. My other friend and I want to visit her, but because we are forced to stay 1.5m apart from each other, she can't drive with me in my car. So, I hope one of you could help me, if, for example, you are in her state right now, what would you want to hear from your friends and family or what would you want them to do?

And then a nurse. Then a veterinarian. Then a teacher. A phlebotomist? And \\\*insert a never ending list here\\\*... Each time I choose a career that I think would genuinely give me joy, I research it and watch YouTube videos on it and read books about it because I am so deeply infatuated with the field.

700,"My Tips: Survivng a Comic Con or ""Other Times You're Around a Lot of People"" with Depression","I thought this could be a place where we talk about fixes for times like these. I'm gonna add my tips, but I'd love to get yours in the comments.

I guess this is for those like me (but hey, that's what comments are for. For those with anxiety, please add your own advice). I'm not super shy, but I find being around a lot of people makes me:

* antisocial.
* very irritable and impatient.
* tired. So, *so* tired. Like I could fall asleep leaning against a wall.
* headaches and stomach problems. Just... the whole time.

But I'm into the nerd stuff. Which means Comic Cons. And despite being surrounded by cool, interesting things and people, I often find myself sitting against a wall in a corner, aching head in hands, trying not to cry/fall asleep, and not wanting to do anything or meet anyone and even if I do I'm in a bad mood about it.

So here is what I've been trying lately that seems to be working.

* Meal prep. Solves a couple problems. Don't have to wait in ridiculous lines which exacerbates my irritability and I'm eating better food that I know won't upset my already inevitably upset stomach. It's almost ridiculous how much food I bring, but my friends are often jealous.
* Painkillers. I used to wait for ""as needed,"" now I just take them at each meal time, so 3x/day for the length of the event.
* Caffeine. I bring my own again skipping the lines.
* Water. Good headache and energy fix.
* Items for when I really need that downtime (and I always do and that's ok). I just sketch the things/people around me with a basic sketchbook and pencil. I try not to think, and the people-watching + hand movements I've found really helps me focus.
* Have me time. ""Oh hey, I really wanted to go to this instead. See you later."" Or honestly just ""I need a break."" Set your boundaries and don't feel bad enforcing them. Anyone who pressures you to hang out with them the whole time isn't worth spending the whole time with.
* Conversely, before attempting to meet up with someone, smile. Like a ridiculously huge smile. Shake myself out with a couple hops. Yeah it sounds weird, but in this particular case I'm surrounded by weird people. Otherwise, I do it in the bathroom. 
* Sleepy time drugs. I'm all wound up at the end of the day despite being exhausted at the event itself. No shame in popping some melatonin and a benadryl or whatever you need.

That's it I think. It's been working pretty well. I've actually met and connected with people and followed up with them after the con. I actually laughed without alcohol for a change. I enjoy myself.

What are your tips for things like this? Concerts, conferences, conventions, whatever.

703,Getting over losing a friend,"Had a pretty dramatic falling out with a friend over the past half a year or so. I'm doing better now - I used to be really angry, and I blamed her for a lot of things that went wrong. I spent every night for a month straight just thinking horrible things about her. I was really low for a long time.

Now I don't get angry or overtly emotional anymore if I see pictures of her. I just feel regret. I feel sad.

Anyway - I can't tell what's healthy and what's not. Is it okay to still think of her almost on a daily basis? We haven't talked in two months but I've seen her briefly a couple of times since we have mutual friends but we haven't interacted.

I keep writing letters to her that I'll never send of course, but I do it just to get it all out. And every time I tell myself that this is the last one, this is the last one, and after this one I'll let go for good and move on with my life - but I keep going back to everything that happened. It's constantly on my mind.

It changed my whole life. We were flatmates and we moved out because of this mess. She lives with mutual friends and I barely ever see any of them because I can't go over. I've met up with some of them a couple of times for lunch or coffee but it's hard for me because I have social anxiety and I also work fulltime. We all work fulltime. I live in a completely different part of the city than I used to. Everything is different. The life I used to have fell apart when she left.

Is it normal to miss her even if I hurt her so much? I was a horrible friend to her. Another mutual friend keeps telling me that our friendship was toxic and we shouldn't try to get it back. A couple of months ago my ex-friend told me that she still wants to fix everything, someday - so I'm afraid that I'm hoping for something that will never happen. Is that normal? Is it unhealthy? Is it wrong that I miss her and that I dream of making amends? Of telling her that I don't blame her anymore? That I'm not angry with her anymore? Is it wrong to dream of having just one more conversation with her, about everything?

I just miss her. I promised I'd get healthy. I promised I'd get better. I'm struggling to .... do all that just for myself. Just for my own sake.

705,"Having trouble getting over the final moment, as well as the passing of, my favourite pet.","So. I am in my early twenties and this is definitely the worst emotional pain I've ever experienced. But first some backstory.

We have had several pets in the family before, but they (cat + dog) were more my parents pets than mine, and passed away when I was very little. However, the two pets that we got afterwards we've had for around 12 years.

We found a baby tabbie cat when he was only a couple months old and brought him home as the sole pet for several years. At some point we adopted an adolescent labrador and had quite the full house. I can't remember if my father left home before or after this, but it was around this time.

My mother tended to gravitate towards our dog, and my brother and I towards our cat (Though I can't speak for him). Throughout our schooling, we always loved both our pets though I'm sorry to say I preferred our cat due to his exceptionally friendly nature, as well as being able to cuddle him a bit easier than a growing labrador.

Now. After my brother left home these 'roles' became more and more re-enforced, until a few weeks ago when we noticed that our cat was getting a little thin. I initially didn't believe it to be a huge issue since he had been at similar weights before, but my Mum took him to a vet none the less. I clearly remember Mum telling me that he had some shockingly bad results for his blood tests, indicative of kidney failure. She had burst into tears in a way I'd never seen before, and I didn't know what to do.

The day afterwards, there was some more news from the vet that there was a chance it was only an infection causing the results. I, very much in denial, clung to that news since I truly didn't know how to deal with the alternative. So, we began giving him antibiotics.

In the next days my best buddy went from looking quite thin, to VERY thin, to the stage where we weren't sure whether he was even eating or not. It became evident that he was not, and we began constantly encouraging him to eat or drink something or anything, to no avail.

At this point Mum said to me that she had to consider putting him to sleep, admitting that she was initially shocked by the option when the vet had suggested it the previous week. ""Isn't there a chance that it's just an infection?"".
Mum revealed that no, there was no chance. The vet had made that clear after her most recent visit. This was news to me.

Essentially I just broke down, I couldn't believe what was happening. My best friend would be leaving me, on the 25th, at 7pm. The worst part was how unexpected this was. From my own research, he should live another 3, if not 5 more years. This was especially troubling to realise. The sole reason, a shear chance of genetics. No peaceful death, just a rude interruption, hacking away at him.

Luckily, my university semester hasn't started yet, so I was able to spend as much time with him at home as I could. My brother actually came by for dinner, and we had a pretty awful night just realizing the gravity of it and that my brother would never see him again. This was the first time I think I'd ever seen him cry.

Over the next days I took so many pictures and videos of him when he was comfortable, even some sound recordings of him purring. Though of course, the day eventually rolls around, and I have no clue what to do, or how I'll feel afterwards.

The vet arrives. Another wave of tears. I bring our cat to the couch, so Mum can hold him. I didn't know if I wanted to leave the room or not, but I eventually do. The vet calls me back after a few minutes saying that he's now sedated, asking if I want to say anything or hold him. NOW I see that I should have picked him up and hugged him close, but... I don't. I feel so awful, but I just pat his head, say ""Bye, bud"", and leave the room.

I don't know if it was the vet being there, or me not wanting to interrupt or anything, but I feel just fucking awful knowing that I didn't even hug him as the last thing he knew. That was yesterday, and I can't stop crying or kicking myself every time I thinking about him.

Right now, I just feel like a worse person. Nothing can change what has happened. The combination of such extreme emotions that I've never felt or seen before from my family, as well as my own actions, just floors me each time I think about it. I keep thinking about it from our cats perspective, did he even realise I was there?

I realise that a single day isn't exactly the best timespan during which to analyse any of this, but that's not what I'm asking advice on. I know I will feel better with time about the situation as a whole. What I don't know is whether I can forgive myself for not taking the final opportunity to physically hold this creature that I've loved for so long, and that left so soon.

I'm using a secondary account since my family knows all my social media profiles.

I have a big problem and I want to know is someone can relate and/or offer advice.

I have no motivation regarding my personal interests or well-being. I have been suffering from OCD and panic attack for a long time and I see a psychiatrist on a regular basis for these issues. I focus on my OCD therapy since it's the most debilitating thing at the moment, but I have zero regards for myself

I am unable to start or complete tasks for my own benefit . But if someone else benefits from it or expects me to, I am able to lift mountains. 

\- I powered through college because I feared punishment and dissapointing my mom, even though I fucking hated what I studied, and I hate my job now 

\- I have fixed cars, electronics, maintained and built websites and software (though I'm not in CS, far from it....), wrote texts, done all kind of menial work, hurt myself performing dangerous tasks.... For other people

\- I have an article to write, I cannot start for the life of me. I had no problem writing half of her article for my GF, despite mine having a much more urgent deadline.

\- I have interests in filmmaking, hip hop music. I am totally unable to stand up for myself and free some time for those hobbies. I am now surrounded by vampires who reap the fruits of my stupidity, I do tasks because I'm expected to, I work because I am expected too. I am totally devastated when someone is unsatisfied with me, even when I know that expectations are irrealist....

I think this may come from my childhood, my dad and his family were verbally abusive and just plain assholes. They put me down a lot, I never got praise or anything despite being excellent at school. It's not like they wanted me to succeed by toughening me up. I know for a fact, they wanted me to fail just so that they could feel superior to me, even my dad who acted like he was the nicest guy when we were in public, and then abused me and my little brother at home. He told me things like ""shut the fuck up, everytime you open your mouth you say stupid shit"" and others things like that when I was like 5 or 6... When i got into grade school, he told me ""you're an investment so someone will take care of me during my old days"". No praise, nothing. So I think I'm looking for love in other people, forgetting myself  and my own interests in the process.  

Sorry it's been a bit long and english is not my first language.

I drove to the spot I’ve planned to jump from three times this year - the problem is that the feelings become not intense enough to commit suicide by the time I get there, but never calm enough to become manageable or acceptable either.

I feel helpless because I can't even get myself to get help. I am regressing socially, physically and mentally and I'm not sure when it is going to stop. I hope I get myself out of this rut somehow, but I know that I'm going to be regressing for a while. I hate that I'm a broken human being. I wish there was a turn off switch which could just end my life without causing too much of a mess. I've been dysfunctional for far too long.

714,Help with Narcissism: Craving Attention,"I'm 22, M, in college. I realized recently that I think I am a huge Narcissist, and am not sure what to do about it. I show many symptoms, but for right now I want to mainly focus on one of my biggest problems, my constant need for attention.

I go on social media, or sometimes post things in discord servers with the expected outcome of being at least acknowledged. Whenever I am alone with my thoughts or ignored (no matter the reason) I start getting really sad. I feel scared and hate everything around me, and normally retreat to my room. Often times I try to text one of my relatives because I know they can't ignore me. I also end up doing unhealthy amounts of daydreaming, normally about a different world where I have friends and I'm a different person. 

I used to think that I was upset because I barely had friends and was lonely. But I started to see that there was more to this problem after i started meeting new people but still felt the same sadness. 

When looking for a remedy and talking to many different therapists over the last 10 or so years, I keep hearing the same thing: ""you have to find self-worth, and build self-esteem"". I try, but I dont feel any different. If anything, I feel like there is no point in life and living if there is no one else involved. This may also be why I have thoughts of suicide when I lack attention. To this day I still wish I was never born. It seems like self-worth is trivial, and means nothing.

715,I'm finding it really tough to have a positive mindset about life. Can someone help me?,"I'm generally a ""chill"" person and have historically been able to handle bad things better than others. And that has helped me now when I'm depressed as well. But my depression isn't really going away. I feel so utterly lifeless the whole day. Sometimes, I'll actually feel positive for a couple of hours but after that I go back to feeling empty (usually happy when I'm around new people/friends and then sad when I get back to my room [alone]). Other times, I'll force myself to look at the bright things in life. Try to tell myself that if I get things done those couple of hours will last longer. But these moments also don't last long and usually at the end of these moments I wonder if these sort of techniques even work.

Anyways, lately I've been getting pretty suicidal again. I'm 90% confident that if I was not as ""tough"" as I am, I would be dead already or at least tried to kill myself more than just the one time I have. I have tried a lot of the things people have advised me to try but they haven't really worked for me for whatever reasons. I can't go to a professional because of finance and cultural reasons. I am doing horribly in life as well, so it is not like my situation is going to get any better in the future (I am 21 and in college). Coming to think of it, I don't really want help. I just want to change and become normal but don't see a way to because the second I am alone in my room I become insecure, negative, suicidal and whatever. It is like I realize how dire my situation is. That when the dust settles, everything is always going to be bad for me.  Thank you for reading my post. Have a nice day.",1540827673.0

I'm also going to take the advice of u/Mrs_Anthropy_ once I'm in a better place financially. I already know I have a testosterone deficiency, even by female standards so it'd be worth it to look deeper into that. I'll share results after that too in case it may help others.",1531012853.0
719,My life is falling apart.,"Doctors tell me I suffer from anxiety and depression. Pretty sure they are the cause of my issues. Anyways, my life is in a real hole right now. I'm about to finish up at college. Got one class left. Gonna graduate with a really good GPA, bachelor's in accounting. I hate accounting. Truth is though I hate everything. Not in a ""well, I wanted to be a musician but I don't think I'll ever be good enough"" kind of way either. I mean there's literally nothing I care about. I know a lot of people will tell me to ""man up"" and ""work isn't supposed to be fun, but because of how much I loathe everything I can't make myself work. I like have some sort of mental aversion to working hard and thinking hard and its becoming extremely debilitating. Right now I work at a Wal-Mart because the work is braindead and often times I can get away with slacking off. Although overall the work ends up being very hard on my body I don't have to think and I don't have to develop skills. That's another thing. I hate practicing anything. I hate learning. I would force myself to do those things but I just can't. 

The way I get by right now is more or less mooching off my fairly successful girlfriend. I feel terrible about it. Not only because I love her and don't want to use her but because I know many people are not as lucky as I am to have someone to fall back on...I've tried everything to fix myself though. Pills, motivational stuff, therapy, etc. I've been to mental hospitals 3 times. Nothing works. I'm getting desperate too because life is starting to takes it toll. Car troubles, weird medical troubles, stuff I don't have money for. I just can't make myself do it. I guess I do care, I just can't mentally/physically make myself exert effort to learn/try more things so I can make more money. I'm doing really well in school because I guess my mental process is always ""well the semester will end soon then you won't have to care anymore"". I don't practice in between semesters so always have to learn ALL the accounting stuff from my entire college career all over again every time...its actually kind of impressive how fast I've retaught myself stuff before. 

When it comes to real life though its a no go. I just can't bring myself to do it. I started taking more hours cleaning at Wal-Mart figuring I can just do that forever if I take enough hours, I only need to make enough money to help my girlfriend with the bills...but the work is hard and its taking a toll on my body. Like really bad. I'm looking for some unique solutions here guys. I know I have to do the work to solve my problems...but the real problem is that I can't force myself to do that. I'm really on a cliff here. Not sure what else I can do. I feel like maybe I'm just extremely lazy, but at the same time I really do feel awful about it I just can't force myself to put in effort in anything. Hell the only thing I do for fun is play video games and that's usually just because you don't have to be good to get through the main story/campaign/normal mode/whatever. I have read a lot of these kinds of posts before and the people replying usually want to know about interests. I wouldn't say I'm super passionate about them but for the purpose of anticipating questions and answering them beforehand I'll say I tend to play games like Monster Hunter and Phantasy Star.

Sorry for the giant blocktext but I wanted to be super specific and dump every relevant piece of information in case someone does end up reading it and might have an idea of how to help me.

TLDR: Have anxiety and depression. Tried just about every solution I can think of. I care about nothing and can't force myself to exert any mental effort in tasks, thus I can't get work higher than Wal-Mart. I have no personal interests either. My life is starting to fall apart.

720,How can something meaningful amount to nothing?,"Apparently I was the person who taught him how to be less closed off and more giving. I taught him how life cannot be lived on the defensive. 

Unfortunately, this was all after we broke apart. I say broke apart because we were never really together. We were best friends and after I confessed before he was leaving for college, it was decided that even though he felt the same way about me, but because he wasn't really sure about a concrete future together, it wouldn't be wise for my sake to stay in touch until he was ready. So we stopped talking after that summer. (To be clear, due to long distance and on a principle level, a relationship was out of the question). We left everything on chance. After all, we were just 18 and hadn't really experienced anything like this before. We did met here and there, and everytime we spoke on birthdays or chance encounters, we would speak for hours on end, not feeling time pass by at all. It always felt right and never strained or weird. 

We last spoke in January, it had been two years after everything that had happened and I just needed to know where we stood with one another. He told me that I was the most important person in his life because I taught him so many things about how to be brave. And when I suggested we stay in touch and see where life takes us, he was sceptical and didn't think I could own his end of the descision. The descision being that he just couldn't recipoceate and couldn't promise anything at all. Apparently he still couldn't tell me if he wanted to be a permanent part of my life. 

Throughout this whole ordeal he strung me, unknowingly, on a 'maybe' and because he never outwordly rejected me, it sort of always felt like it was going to happen at some point in the future. All of this uncertainty and ambiguity also got our mutual friends involved and they starting looking for answers, because they genuinely felt that things should be known for certain. 


Fast forward to now, I'm still in the headspace of him constantly occuping my thoughts. And I have just come to know, through these mutual friends, that he no longer feels the same way. And that he now looks at the situation in retrospect and without feeling like he's still a part of that equation. He looks at it like a learning experience. And over the course of the year, he's stopped thinking about the situation at all. I think what makes me the saddest is that i always thought we were a team making it through, but he so easily forgot about me as a real person and treated me more like an experience to move ahead from. Moreover, with all the things he has managed to learn and in all the ways i have helped him, why still am I not a viable option.

Perhaps it was the keeping out of touch factor and that he moved to another country and wasn't constantly reminded of me, but is that a good enough reason? Should i blame myself for not pursuing it then? 

Perhaps if we had stayed friends, the feelings might have dissipated, but a future could have still been possible.

Perhaps his feelings just weren't real. Or does real love even exist? 

I'm just wondering how such intense feelings and love can amount to nothing. Or perhaps it was that we were always on opposite sides of the spectrum. I wanted to dive right into it and he wanted to play it safe and dial it down. We never really had a big fight or reason for it to end. It just sort of happened and there were and still aren't any hard feelings about it. I can't for the life of me hate him.

I still miss him and it's still so difficult for me to get him out of my head. Sometimes I wish I could learn to look at it the way he does, so that we could maybe fall back into an easy going friendship. Or maybe I'm just lying to myself and incapable of seeing my own flaws. 

Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing..

How do I learn how to let go and accept this without feeling immense regret and longing? 

I just feel really stupid for not thinking tactfully about the entire situation. Maybe we were supposed to find each other so we could teach each other our biggest flaws. But isn't that reason enough to keep each other a part of our lives?

723,My mother just told me she was suicidal at the time she abused me. I feel dirty. I don't get it.,"My mum’s had a history of throwing glass at me, emotional abuse and even ‘damning me to hell’ because she caught me cutting when I was younger. To put it bluntly, she’s catalysed this misery that’s been in me since I was 8.

Been suicidal until the past six months, where I’ve felt recovered (I’m 19 now). Not even the irrational out-of-nowhere suicidal thoughts have really made a peep. I’ve gotten along with my life and made the steady move to study for university. In my spare time, I write songs and play the piano. I just got noticed was given a small gig at a local bar. Life’s been good.

And then my mother finds one of my records I’d written when I was depressed. It had some pretty incriminating signs that I was in a bad place. She starts to interrogate ‘concerned’ about my mental health and of course I deny deny deny. After all, I’d rather tell a stranger about my misery than the one who put me there.

But then when I let it slip that she’s not been the best mother and when I give the examples e.g. she threatened kill herself  because of me when I was little (with props!), she tells me how hard life was for her back then. I get that she had big problems but knowing my abuser was suicidal at the time she abused me feels dirty and gross. I know how horrible it feels to be depressed but I just felt like she was justifying all the bruises and abuse.

She probably doesn't understand why I'm so bitter. I've been trying to get over it but I hate her. When it comes to mates in need of solace, I take them up and show them mental illness is not something to be ashamed of and I help them through it but when it’s my mother (who mocked me when I used to be depressed) telling me deep things about herself and looking for support and love, I feel so shit and dirty. What gives her the right to tell me things like that and try to help me when she put me there in the first place?

I deleted the record and I've been crying for a good three hours now. I'm kind by nature and a logical thinker but I can't find logic in this.

I'm 24 and still live with my father after graduating college, and while I do some work it's inconsistent, and I struggle to hold down a job, and my attempts to apply to graduate/professional school have stagnated or even downgraded. This is ""fine"" because I'm still living rent-free and bill-free, so I can get away with just accomplishing the bare minimum in life and can languish in what I think is my depression.

I have about enough savings that I could sublet/rent a room for about two months or so. And I have a car (which is both a blessing and a curse in my city, Los Angeles). I'm thinking of just moving out - even though I emotionally don't want/don't have any desire to live on my own. For a variety of family drama/historical reasons, if I leave my home, I will not be able to move back in with my father short of some actual, external calamity befalling me - so if I fuck up or get fucked up by my depression while trying to live on my own, I'll probably just end up homeless. ~~In Los Angeles.~~ So I wouldn't have an option except to move forward with my life, and would have no capacity to languish.

730,How do I accept my own mediocrity?,"**Disclaimer:** Wall of text ahead, with no visible point. Might delete this later when I'm feeling better.

I'm graduating college this spring. It's been rough.

I went from straight A's my freshman year to nearly failing out my junior year because I didn't want to live anymore. There were a lot of factors as to why - I felt incredibly discouraged by how many other students came in with an advantage due to their prior programming experience, my own lack of genius, and on top of that, my roommate started dating my high school friend and my jealousy was distracting. I've always reacted very poorly to feeling *not good enough*, and things just slowly fell apart.

It's a typical negative cycle. You feel bad, then you start feeling bad for feeling bad. Eventually you don't know how you started in the first place, just that *feeling bad* has been all you've ever known.

I'd like to think I'm recovering. My grades are mediocre, and I'll graduate on time thanks to generous AP credits and lax degree requirements. I don't think about killing myself much, and the emptiness and apathy has been replaced with plain ol' anger and bitterness. Sometimes I even think I'll be happy in the future.

But it's hard, graduating and finding a job and becoming a competent adult. I'm home for winter break and I don't think I've had a single conversation with my parents that didn't end in tears. Just a matter of differing viewpoints and expectations - my parents just want me to be able to graduate on time, find some kind of job, maybe do what my roommate did and find myself a rich boyfriend who'll take care of me.

That's not what I want. How have I gotten to the point where just *graduating* is an accomplishment? Why am I so absolutely, so infuriatingly *mediocre*? All I ever wanted to be was *good at something*, but it seems that's too much to ask for.

I was a really good student in high school. People respected me and expected me to do great things. Now, when I look at the accomplishments of others - they're starting companies, picking up internships with Big 4 tech companies, enjoying themselves - I can't help but feel I peaked in high school, and my life has just been a long trend downhill ever since. I don't want to be a disappointment. I'd rather die than be a failure - if at first you can't succeed, destroy all evidence you tried.

I don't know where I'm going with this, really. I don't have a clear question someone can answer.

My thinking is illogical and self-contradictory. I am too proud to accept I am just a normal person - not special, not talented, not going to change the world - but I've always struggled with imposter syndrome and feeling like I'm not good enough and never will be. I know that I need to improve myself but I can't make the first move because I'm too crippled by my fear of admitting failure and by my suspicion that no matter what I do, I'll never catch up with what I want to be.

I can find the flaws in my own thinking, identify why it's negative and doesn't make sense, but I can't make myself believe my own logic. I know the way I think is overwhelmingly fatalistic and negative, but knowing won't make it go away.

Honestly, I just want to look at my resume without crying. That's all.

**Aside:** I dated someone last year, during the worst of my depression. I still feel awfully guilty about it - I spooked badly and just cut off all communication with them because I couldn't handle and didn't think I was worthy of being in a relationship. I'll apologize to them one day. I just don't know when I'm ready to do it.",1484111355.0

734,What's a good way to deal with feelings of regret and a lack of progress compared to everyone around you?,"I just turned 29, and for years, have suffered from depression brought on mainly by self-loathing and non-existent self-esteem.  It's generally prevented me from really getting anywhere in my personal goals.

While some therapy over the past year has finally helped me feel better about myself and what I can do, my depression is shifting its focus from self-deprecation to regret what I view as a lifetime of failures, and how little I have going compared to literally everyone I know.  While I'm trying to tell myself ""better late than never"", it's not working, and I'm also starting to worry that attempting to fix things so late will result in very little coming from all of it.

I also am unsure how to go about fixing the things that are top priorities.  I finally left my parents' house and got my own apartment three years ago, but while I handled independent living well myself, the roommate I ended up with had some major issues in general, causing the whole situation to unravel.  I want to try again, but I don't make enough money to support another apartment on my own ($1500 a month at most; usually more like $1100), and I'm very hesitant about the prospect of more roommates, especially when I have no current candidates among friends and family.

I also finally want to focus on getting a career path going that's more focused on things I'm actually good at and interested in, compared to the unfulfilling office job I've had for four years.  Unfortunately, even though I've started taking Fridays off solely to work on building experience and a portfolio for that, it's still progressing at a snail's pace.  I honestly want to just quit my job and take full advantage of not paying for living with my parents to get things done faster, but I have no idea how feasible or smart that would or wouldn't be.

Does anyone here have experience with a similar situation?  I want to work around these obstacles, but don't know the best way to do it.",1466700175.0
735,So what is involved with depression therapy?,"Obviously, I would first need to get officially diagnosed.  I'm not a psychologist, so I can't be 100% that depression is my issue.

With luck, it would just be, I don't know, a chemical imbalance?  Something easily fixed with a pill?  That would be funny, almost, all these years cured with some simple medication.

But maybe it doesn't work like that.  Back in uni, I stopped by the school councilors a few times.  They weren't real councilors; just grad students from another nearby uni, there to get real experience or something.  It didn't really help, so I said I felt better, and they accepted it, and I was done. 

Are real counsilors like that?  What exactly happens when you decide to ""get help""?",1458338274.0
736,How do I transition from getting over depression to being more driven as a person?,"So, I think I'm over depression. I think I'm on the right track, I think. How do I go from that to being driven, or 'actualised' or generally, having my shit together?

Like... I like running. I really do. I like the meditative part of it, eating what I like, feeling strong, feeling fit. Unfortunately, my brain keeps telling me ""no"", I can't go out at this time of day, I'll get attacked by mobs of children, or it's too wet, or it's too dark, I'l get run over, weird stuff like that. I suppose I'm becoming less reliant on my medication to get me out of bed in the morning and my brain's going back into its old patterns. 

Okay, what would Epictetus say. I am only responsible for my own actions. Things outside of my control should be anticipated. I guess I could try doing that, trying to reprogramme my brain a bit.

Maybe try meditating? I dunno, I feel like there are so many things in my life I just do almost involuntarily, without meaning to, and there are so many things that would make me live longer, get on with things, concentrate more, and I'm just averse to them. Why is doing what's best for yourself so hard?",1442352631.0
737,Wish me luck -- I started antidepressants today!,"I took my first pill of Prozac today. 

This is huge to me. My life has sucked for a few years, and I've only recently considered the possibility that it's due to a mood disorder rather than a character flaw. First of all, this shift in perspective is spiraling me into an identity crisis. Second, I feel a little guilty taking pills, like I'm too weak and cowardly to take the responsibility of my own mind. But, rationally, that's wrong! And no matter how stupid and wrong, this thought continues to berate me... which is probably my depression talking... Anyway, I wanted to mark this moment of my life by sharing with you guys on reddit. Taking an antidepressant is the finale on my dilemma of do-I-suck-or-do-I-have-depression, with an answer of *you have depression, but maybe you actually suck, but let's try this route because the alternative hasn't been working.* (and that ""alternative"" is lengthy: from philosophizing to motivate me to live, to omega-3 pills and sunshine and terribly upbeat pop music, etc.) After years of self-blame and misery, it is relieving to try a pill that'll hopefully accomplish (or at least help me accomplish) what I've been trying so long to.

And, I'm aware that this takes time to kick in and might not even work! I just see some hope for myself now.",1426742688.0
738,Beginning of a series on Depression at Art of Manliness,"AOM is one of my all time favorite websites. Some articles I read there turned into hobbies or habits that made big differences in my life. Apparently the founder, Brett McKay also has depression in his genes and has gone through it a few times in his life. He wrote an article kicking off a series on depression that will cover research, strategies for handling it, getting over it, and even harnessing it for good. I think it's going to be interesting to see him talk about this topic that men -- especially men who pride themselves on their masculinity -- don't usually talk about in public.

739,Motivational Monday: Coping with the stigma of mental illness,"Hello all,

I was asked to post a guest Motivational Monday post, so here it is. I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in the State of Washington with experience working with a variety of individuals and mental illnesses. I also moderate and created /r/helpmecope to help people through difficult times in their lives.

Today's post is about coping with the stigma of mental illness. For years I have heard clients, friends, family, colleagues, etc. deny that they are experiencing difficulties with mental illness. Shoot, I denied the fact that my depression and anxiety sometimes affected my ability to work through the difficult stages in my life. 

It is already difficult to cope with your own difficulties, including anxiety, depression, hypervigilance, nightmares, low self-esteem, auditory hallucinations, delusions, etc. Why should others be able to stick their noses where they don't belong and mess with our lives? Who are they to make things worse for us?

I am here to give you some real-life lessons I have learned from my own experience, as well as the experience of clients I have had the pleasure of knowing. 

1. Own it. Own your symptoms, diagnosis, and/or difficulties you face on a regular basis. The more you feel you need to hide the fact that you are experiencing difficulties coping, the more afraid you'll be to discuss it with anyone. If people tell you that you need to ""keep it in"" or ""stuff it away,"" don't listen to them. This is your life and your functionality we are talking about here, not theirs.

2. Talk about it. The symptoms won't change and could possibly get worse if you don't talk about it. Talk to a friend, family member, neighbor, professional, anyone you can trust. Simply talking about your symptoms and thoughts can sometimes provide relief in, and of, itself.

3. Distance yourself from negative influences. If someone tries to convince you that your symptoms aren't real, are imagined, or aren't as bad as you think they are, distance yourself from that person. Until they are able to recognize that you are experiencing difficulties that they may know nothing about, they will likely try to convince you that everything is okay and to stop talking so much about it. If an individual is not a positive support person and willing to be there for you when you need them, they are not a friend. Do no rely on them for help in any way, because you will usually be disappointed.

4. It is not a competition. I have seen some people talk about feeling ""more depressed"" than others, like it is a competition or something. Let me tell you, experiencing debilitating symptoms or having difficulty functioning because of various difficulties should not be a competition. There is nothing to brag about when it comes to not being able to eat or shower for days because your depression won't allow you to get out of bed, or your anxiety not allowing you to leave your home due to fear that something may happen.                                                 4b. This also goes for not competing against others to determine who's treatment is working quicker. 

5. Everyone is different. We all handle difficulties and symptoms differently, the same way not everyone's body handles psychotropic medications the same way. If you talk to someone who has experienced the same difficulties/symptoms you have experienced, do not compare or tell them what to do, simply let them know that you are there and give them a list of things that worked for you while also guiding them in the direction of a professional that is trained and educated to provide the necessary resources.

6. Screw the haters/non-believers. Just because they can't see that you are experiencing difficulties doesn't mean that they aren't real. Even with delusions and hallucinations, they are real to the person experiencing them. It is not up to someone else to try to convince them that they aren't real, because most people have no idea how realistic the hallucinations and delusions are. If people deny that you are experiencing symptoms or difficulties and won't stop badgering you about it, walk away and tell yourself ""Screw them. They have no idea.""

7. FMLA. For those in the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) can be a lifesaver (as well as a job-saver). If your symptoms are debilitating to the point that you may miss weeks of work each year, pursue FMLA by talking to a Mental Health Professional to receive an evaluation and talk to your Human Resources people to see about the process. 

8. You are all awesome. Each and every one of you. You have defeated some invisible demons that no one else will know about. You have overcome life-defining difficulties under the nose of everyone you care about and cares about you. These silent issues can be debilitating and even life-threatening if you don't get help. Because you are here on this sub and helping people that you don't even know makes you an amazing person and you should give yourself a pat on the back.

Thank you all for your time. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I would also love to get some input on what I wrote and possibly have people add things that helped them.

741,I have withdrawn from the world and I want to get involved again.,"I'm safe in my cocoon of my relationship and family and work-from-home job. 

The world hurts, it's full of ambitious people, happy people, healthy people, and also thoughtless people, damaged people, selfish people. People spend their time on weird and pointless things, art is decadent and strange and requires so much thinking, education is a commodity, everywhere is choked with people and their needs, and the internet makes my mind feel choked with information, cities are complex, people are left on the outside of them, people produce our food and carry away our waste but we never see them or meet them. So many things are wrong, our current culture is a setting sun and everything will be destroyed soon, the only thing left to do is be kind to each other. 

I don't need to be ""successful"" in this world, I don't need to fight with it. But inside my cocoon I'm bored and sad. I want to be healthy and I just want to interact with the world and try to understand it and be kind to others without being afraid of it or feeling like it's threatening me. ",1414998230.0
742,How can I stop depression when I feel it coming back?,"Today is the first day that the feeling of depression has truly hit me. The signs have slowly crept up on me over the last few days but now I can feel the spiralling demotivation happening, is there anything I can do to prevent this from going further?

I'm currently on study leave from sixth form, so contact with my friends (who are also studying) is minimal. Isolation is always one of the things that makes my depression worse, but there's not much way to improve it because everyone's too busy revising to meet up. I have 2 exams left, which I need to do my best on, and I can feel absolutely no motivation to even pick up a text book right now. I haven't revised properly in 3 days, and I'm panicking that I'll end up failing everything I've worked for up to this point.

I've had depression in the past and my grades have suffered immensely, I dropped a subject in school due to it and am now only taking 3 AS levels. I've been relatively depression-free since the start of the year with only small periods in which I felt low, but at this time it's crucial I can stay on top of things to just get my exams out of the way.

745,Small victories - identified one of my triggers last night and how to stop it triggering.,"So last night I found myself lying in bed, inexplicably thinking about my ex and his promise of staying friends which he failed to live up to. I already know abandonment is a big trigger for me, which is why it's so easy to lie awake for an hour or two ruminating on his behaviour. But since I hadn't fallen into that cycle of thought for a while, I tried to think why on earth I'd fallen into it last night.

And I spotted it - I got a text message just before bed from a friend who I haven't seen for a while, apologising for not keeping in touch (I haven't been well recently) and explaining she'd been very stressed recently. It was just enough to hit the abandonment trigger and start me thinking about the one person who really has abandonned me. 

But the victory is that I also realised how to counter the trigger. The friend who texted *was* keeping in touch by texting me, even though we haven't seen each other for a couple of weeks. She usually is a dedicated and trusted friend, and she still is, she's just had her own problems recently. I re-tracked my thoughts onto how she usually is very supportive and how she's gone to the effort to stay in touch even when it's proving difficult for her.

Now I can recognise that trigger - small doubts about friends turning my head towards real abandonment - and I can counter it by reminding myself those doubts are small and the friendships are strong. And that makes me happy again.",1377679562.0

747,getting over perfectionism,"i feel like my old job wounded me in many ways, including being so so so afraid of making mistakes and sounding stupid. 

reading feedback from my clients felt like i was getting attacked due to how they gave it to me and the amount of edits they make. because of that, i found it hard to actually be productive and work efficiently to fix it. 

other than that, sometimes when i talked, my old boss would say ""i dont get it"" or ""you're not making sense"", which really hurt my confidence as well. 

now at my new job, i of course still get feedback about what i write and it felt so disheartening to see the amount my new boss changed. when i apologised, he did say that it's normal and i should not feel disheartened. he even told me about a similar thing he experienced in his career and how he learned from it. 

i am trying to not feel sad or panicking about fucking up at my new job but i can't (haven't been able to) get over my negative experience at the company i worked for before this one.

748,One of the most simple yet relieving philosophical ideas that could make living easier for you.,"I currently work in the military, and naturally that path comes with stress, sometimes lots of it. It can be easy to let your mind spiral into thinking everything is hopeless and everything sucks forever and ever, until you realize its all a game. 

Now yes this can interfere with certain beliefs if you have them,, but it works for me. Just realize life isnt that serious and doesnt actually matter all that much. Yes, you invest into the game by trusting others not to betray you and by trusting that you're making the right choices and that the world isnt after you, and if it ends up blowing up in your face then oh well, thats just how it goes.

Its really simple and probably common sense to many but i forgot this and it made me endure much needless anxiety, insecurity, and depression that could have been avoided.

I've weighed all the options in my head about what I can logically do at this point and all signs seem to point to this as a logical conclusion.  I think I'm finally ready to make a change.  There's an action plan I've devised in my head to get myself back on track.

751,"Entropy, Disarray, Breaking Down, Rot","You place a banana on the counter. It's fine for a few days... but then the brown spots appear, they grow and turn black, they grow so big they merge together. Eventually there's more black than yellow, eventually there's no yellow at all. The plump banana withers and shrinks. The once strong and tight skin is now frail and wrinkled. Mould appears and spreads, eating away at the banana until it's a fraction of its original size. Each molecule is broken down entirely until it becomes dirt once again.

Everything in this cruel universe behaves this way. Stars exhaust their fuel and go dark. People grow old and die. Savings accounts deplete. Empires fall. Paintings collect dust. This is a universal law and nothing is safe from it.

For something to exist in this universe, it must tread water forever to survive. Your heart must continue to beat. Your cells must always remove waste. Animals must carry on running. And you. You must keep trying. You must never give up hope that you will one day be happy.

And when you finally find happiness you must keep treading the water or you'll end up back where you started. As long as you live there are no guarantees. There's no finish line where you no longer have to exert effort.

You're not failing at life, because failure is inevitable. It's like a game that never ends - you can't win, you can only aim for a high score and try to enjoy it. Millions of people play games like Flappy Bird knowing that there's no finish line. Treat life like that and just keep flapping.

I'm going to clean my room now, and when it gets dirty, I'll clean it again. I won't stop flapping my wings or treading the water. I don't particularly enjoy this game, but my soul decided to play it and I would like to know how high a score I can get.

If I stop cleaning and taking care of myself my depression will worsen. If I stop talking to people my social anxiety will worsen. If I stop paying debt, my debt will worsen. You know what you must do to tread your water, but as long as you do nothing your situation will worsen. Take care and feel free to talk to me about your own situation.",1667499831.0
752,Figuring out how to heal and love myself again,"Hi, I (26F) am new to this whole thing but am happy to be here. I need some advice and words of affirmation to help me through this challenging period of my life. This is kind of long so grab a cup of coffee and get comfortable. I have always had this idea that relationships were suppose to add to your happiness. They will love you no matter what and never leave you. Yes people fight, but it will never get to the point of calling it quits. Needless to say, I am loyal to a fault when it comes to love.

My first serious relationship lasted almost 4 years while I was in college. She was manipulative, toxic, controlling but claimed to love me more than life. Before I met her, I was confident and snarky. I would talk to anyone and everyone because I genuinely enjoyed meeting people. This changed while in my relationship, and so far after. I stopped being friendly because it was too ""flirty."" I stopped going out with my friends because I ""should be spending time"" with her. It was a trauma bond in the most toxic way. I lost friends, myself and fell into a very hard depression. I ended things with her last October because I knew mentally and emotionally I  couldn't live the rest of my life depressed and unhappy. At first I was excited to be alone, to spend time with myself and just be me. But I quickly realized I was afraid to be alone, something I had never experienced before. I fell back into a fwb relationship with an old friend, and was telling myself ""this is how I heal"". 

Around February I met someone and decided to give it a try. She was nice but boring, lazy and immature. That situationship lasted about 3 months before I ended things. For a month after I was by myself, I wasn't even sad really, I was just surviving. 

This is where my anxiety intensified, similar to how it was with my ex. Then I met someone at Pride in July and everything changed. We were talking for a few weeks and I told her I'm not good at casually dating. We went on a dates, cuddled on her couch and she was persistent with her feelings for me. I gave her a choice; me or the other girls she's talking to. At first she chose me, but a few days later she decided she ""wasn't ready"" to be exclusive. I said fine and blocked her on everything.  (Mind you I only knew her for a few weeks but I felt it was a forever romance.) 

I quickly fell into someone else and this time fell harder. She lived about an hour or so away from me, but said she actually preferred the distance. We talked on the phone almost every night, she was telling me how she wanted this to work and she really liked me. This went on for a month and a half. I met ALL her friends, she continued to affirm her feelings for me and how she wanted something serious. We had already been physical together which I confessed I NEVER casually do, to which she said she doesn't either but the emotional connection between us made it feel right. Her friends were making plans with us to go to concerts and parties and other states to travel, so I got the feeling it was getting serious. My anxiety since meeting her had been the worst it had ever been. I kept telling myself she was going to leave, she didn't actually like me, and I was just going to get hurt again. I expressed this to her and she grabbed my hands, looked me in the eyes and said ""I want this with you. I want this to work."" I felt relieved, but the anxiety stayed. I would wake up with panic attacks about her not txting me or realizing she didn't like me anymore. It was debilitating and I didn't know what was going on. 

After hanging out with me and her friends on a weekend trip, she started getting distant. I kept trying to ask her if she was ok but kept saying work was keeping her busy. I was wracking my brain with ""what did I do wrong, did I say something or do something she didn't like?"" But I couldn't think of anything. Later that week she told me she got bad news from her family and doesn't have time for a relationship. Her job was time consuming and she'd be out of the state alot to help her family. This was out of nowhere. It has been a week since, and I've been feeling better but I keep going back to before. She was so sure and direct with her feelings for me. What changed? How can someone go from being invested in someone they ""want something serious"" with, to not having time for them? I've cried almost everyday since then and can't help but think she doesn't even care or think about me. Its hurtful to think I am that forgettable and can easily be thrown away.

I am learning to love myself again and to heal. But if I'm being honest, I don't really know how to do that. I talk to my friends, but feel like I'm bothering them. My mom tries to convince me I'm not gay and to date men again, so I don't confide in her as much. I'm constantly afraid of the anxiety and sadness coming back, and I feel like I'm living my life in fear and I'm not good enough. 

I have my moments where I remember how kind and genuine I am, and that being an emotional person isn't a bad thing. But I have been feeling lonely and unsure of what I am doing with my life. 

I'm not sure if anyone is still reading this novel, but if you are, you're not alone in feeling what you're feeling. I'm trying to stay positive and find my happy, loud, funny, care-free, empathetic and loving person I know I still am. Any words of affirmation or advice you have, even a situation similar to mine that you've overcome, would be helpful.

754,(30f) I'm definitely broken,"So... I'm back. Not sure how long it's been, but I'm not as depressed at the moment, but still in that area..

With other episodes in between the last post I've ever posted and this one, there's been a number of episodes of depression. Many come with some self reflection. I e come to realize that I'm pretty fucked up. And this is with each time I talk to my mom about this.

I always feel like I have to be with a specific personality, already with knowing what I like and don't like, dressing ""older"" which is something I don't understand, having a boyfriend and with no fear.

But I have a social anxiety that I think is turning into a phobia, I don't know what I like and don't like entirely, I can never break away from Tshirts and pants, and I'm not feminine or beautiful (or even mentally stable) enough to consider meeting and finding a relationship (I also live in Florida and just want to get the fuck out)

Looking back... I've been sexually assaulted, gaslit, isolated, and mentally tormented in a range of 12-14 years by my older brother. We'll call him R1.

You read that correctly. Sexually assaulted... Although assaulted might sound pretty aggressive... It was more like I was mentally corned to having sex with someone on their mid twenties and I had to keep doing it because I would have gotten a much worse at home situation if I didn't kind of thing... And this started in middle school..

I look back and it's like.. I didn't get a chance to grow as a person. I didn't get to grow and get to know people naturally (I was bullied too so it made it hard too). And I didn't have the full on courage to say something until I was like 26, in art school that was miles away, to stand up to him.. which is a good thing. 

But I feel like I'm stuck.

I feel like I am behind.

I  find myself being told I'm too old for things that I couldn't do. I'm too old to cry. And that the past should stay in the past. But I don't think that. I think what happens to someone just stays with them forever. It's hard to let it go like a one night stand or something (can't say for sure since I've never had one), but I can imagine it takes a heck of a lot of time. But I feel like I'm on some timer... To already be a grown ass woman, to be someone who can just magically get any man and just have confidence.

But I don't have confidence, that's practically non-existent. I can't do things for myself out of feeling bad about being selfish and inconsiderate. I don't feel feminine enough to be like to I can get a guy to like me. I have no social or romantic experience to feel like I can have a relationship with someone. I just feel... Hollow. A broken husk of my body with what would have been a full grown person if my older brother wasn't around...

I also learned R1 has affected my other brother, R2. I had opened up to R2's gf about what happened when she was telling me I should try to meet people in person since I do have friends in person but they live in other states. She had told me that he has messed him up too and that I should open up to R2 about it, but not to mom since it could break her or not accept it at all.

But I gotta figure out what I need to do to help myself without my mom telling my I'm too old to do things or telling me to dress old.. whatever that means...",1650279050.0

I’ve tried countless meds and different types of therapy and none have been effective. At this point, if I was completely alone, I’d be gone by now.

756,Abusive Ex Fiance Falsely Reported Me for Domestic Violence,"I wanted to marry my ex but as time went on she became more and more abusive. Throughout the relationship she threatened to kill me, my family, my friends, and pets. Made me cut off my family for a week because she didn't trust my mom, and after we moved to a different apartment because of mold she wouldn't let me give out the address. One time she pushed and shoved me away from the door to keep me from leaving and when I gave up she made me tea with liquid benadryl in it to keep me from leaving and told me a few days later about it.

In a sick way I loved these things about her even though they were all very traumatizing. I had to call off the wedding because of the random cheating allegations though.

The one night she went totally crazy for hours and wouldn't calm down. I eventually left the apartment and she thought I had gone out to go cheating. I actually went to hang out with a friend she had made me cut off and when I was in the car with him she started threatening to call the police. But didn't send the texts in a way that would be exonerating. By the time I was able to get home she had already called and the cop told me she said I had punched her 4 times and I was arrested. I had to go to jail for 3 days because of snow before I could get out.

She petitioned for a protective order, got it, then called me multiple times a day on it and left voicemails wanting to talk. She spread rumors around and made me lose friends. I ultimately had to take a plea deal because per my lawyer, they were going to believe her testimony. So I now have a permanent record and have to take probation because of her. The bittersweet thing is that the judge saw through her and wouldn't give her a protective order. He instead ordered both of us no contact for 1 year. That's me and her.

Now I'm pretty stuck, I lost my apartment, I'm not gonna be getting married, I have bad thoughts that control my day all day, and I never cheated. This all happened because she thought I was out cheating. And because I have some mental problems I guess, I still want her back. She's totally done and moved on and I guess that was her intention, to devalue me by ruining my life and make whoever I was 'cheating' with go away even though I wasn't cheating. I miss her a lot and all the great things we did together. And I feel inside like I deserved to be treated badly the whole time so all I can do is sit here and cry a lot of the day. I feel like a big loser that doesn't deserve anything good. I'm trying to get therapy but it's not easy.",1645195474.0
757,I need help. I've (18m) have been accused of untrue things which has turned my life upside-down and my gf(17) broke up with me while accusing me of this and along with it my friends and reputation is also gone.,"idk where to start. There's just so much to cover. I'll try to keep this precise and in order but please bear with me if it isn't. And idek what I'm doing anymore. I would appreciate if you could say anything that isn't ""It shall pass/Man up/etc""

TL;DR: Accusations of making her insecure, using her as a rebound and for sexual purposes and being disloyal when none of it is true, then talking to my friends about it and now losing literally everything.

On 24th of September 2020 we started talking and by 26th of December 2020, I started a relationship with A. We had a VERY rocky start. We broke up multiple times like around 3 or 4. But we got back together. We pushed through. I gave my ALL to her. I put her above me. I cared for and lover her more than anything, even more than myself. She had a traumatic past, which meant she brought in commitment and trust issues. But we handled that. I helped her through every single problem that she had told me about. I hated reading books and I wasn't into poetry. And yet I started writing a book and wrote poems and songs for her. I didn't draw either but I drew a portrait of her for her. I helped her with her anxiety and her insecurities. I just did everything for her, to the best of my abilities.

But, on 31st of October '21, 30 days after my birthday. She said she wanted to talk. She told she had been talking with S. This is when she breaks up with me. I was accused of:

1.""Using A as a rebound"",

2.""Using A for sexual purposes"",

3.""Being disloyal"",

4.""Being the reason A was insecure"".

I'll cover them one by one.

In November of 2020, I had asked S out. She didn't reject me as such? But she didn't accept it either saying she wasn't ready, she even made me promise to stay friends forever. And the next day she pulls a knock knock joke on me:

S: ""knock knock""

Me: ""Who's there?""

S: ""Where, when""

Me: ""Where, when who?""

S: ""My place, tomorrow, you and I""

Me: ""Holy fuck-""

S: "":)""

Me: ""IT'S A DATE""

It was like she was leading me on. My great grandmother had also died from Covid in that same month. My grand-dad and grand-mum had Covid during that time but luckily they survived. So when I think about it, I hadn't even processed what was happening around me and it felt like I was trauma bonding with S. After some time, I was the one who took the confession back. After that I started being distant? not exactly distant but I hadn't spoken to her in a while nor had she texted me back. We didn't talk for 2 months.

(This is where things get intense as fuck and confusing as fuck.)

1. In January 2021, S had a plan to meet her friends at my apartment because one of her friends lived there. And her friends were close friends of mine. I wasn't invited but I was told of it. I then asked S if I could come and it was clear on text she wasn't comfortable with me being there, but I didn't pick it up because she was the one who made me promise to stay friends and she was always VERY kind. one of our mutual really close friend, let's call them Z, took her phone and told me ""YOU DON'T NEED AN INVITE COME OVER"". I had 2 reasons to go there, I remember, to pay one of my friends for something and to obviously meet my friends. I was ""stalking S"" is what my friends told me. Since they were there as well (I wasn't stalking her. But one person cannot face many people saying one thing). And I had confessed to another close friend of mine, say AA (Who wasn't there at the meet-up), that I still had feelings for S. Which I definitely don't remember doing. after that, A told me I was hiding S from her. Which I wasn't. A had asked me about my past relationships/ crushes and all and I told her, but I hadn't mentioned S. Why, you ask? Because S never came to mind whenever she asked me, I never remembered. But I had mentioned me having a crush on S on text in August. AA had told me that S hates me because S had been talking with AA. But I chose to ignore it because whenever S and I texted she was always so kind and I never ever felt like she hated me, she never said anything wrong or hateful, moreover she was the one who made me promise to stay friends forever.
2. This is straight forward. Our relationship started with sexting. and as the relationship progressed, we switched to nudes. It was all consensual. I had even asked multiple times if she was comfortable with it or no and always stuck by my word and I have multiple screenshots of making sure she was okay with it and her saying yes. And when I presented these screenshots to A, her response was ""I have nothing to say about that, because, just no."" Which is silly af like wtaf does that fucking mean!? After she had broken up with me, AA told me (Yes he didn't ask and believed A's word) I had used A for sexual purposes and I said yes. The reason I did that was because I lost literally everything that I valued THE MOST in one single night, my gf and all my friends, and I was broken to the point I couldn't think and I just blindly trusted AA. AA told me a normal and healthy relationship doesn't involve any of this sort of sexual things unless the couple has been dating for a solid amount of time. Which has got me confused. Because Whatever I've seen/read/heard hasn't told me that, rather insisted on few relationship starting out sexually, then progressing.
3. After taking the confession back from S, we exchanged texts saying ""I love you"", at that moment, which, was completely innocent and friendly. I sent her cat posts on instagram and wholesome friendship posts. In one of them, it said ""I love you"", which again, was meant in a friendly way, to which both S and A misunderstood. I admit I had sent the same post to 3 other people as well but they were all friendly and were paired with FRIENDSHIP posts. One of them called me ""BESTIE"", the other two I consider younger sisters. \\\*sigh\\\* Mis-communication you say? No. I tried telling them this but all of them are so stubborn they don't care.
4. I once told A about a girl that I saw on a flight. I told her she was really nice looking. I admit this was my fault. This made her incredibly insecure. She had to ask for reassurance. And yes, I gave it to her. She has felt insecure multiple times and I've always made sure that she was feeling well. Even when both of us were feeling terrible, I always made sure she was feeling better first. I always prioritized her, and it never caused an issue, both of us were content. She used to measure her insecurity in levels, which I told her to do so she could understand what she was feeling and on what levels which would help her. She told me she has never been insecure below the level 3. And I had brought it down to level 2. She told me that. She was really happy for that. And I was so fucking happy for her as well because this was progress.

Now. I'm painted as the abuser, user, manipulator, the piece of shit and so much fucking more. I have apologized for where I fucked up but they don't care. AA's words: ""I honestly stopped caring when you said I manipulated you ""(referring to me saying yes to him saying I used A)"" and blamed your great grandmother for what you did"" I didn't blame her ffs that's just hurtful. It's disrespectful. I was just trying to say that there is a reason why things happen and this was a reason, not a justification.

They kept saying ""You're lucky you have it easy, others would have been bullied to suicide."", well guess fucking what. I am suicidal. They bullied me. for days. They spread embarrassing pictures of me(not nudes), they raided my discord server, and A, on purpose, I think, listens to romantic songs with one of my closest friends, say, AG, on a voice channel on discord till 3 am, just to stick it to me.

I took 2 sessions of therapy for this, it didn't help at all. All I got from the therapist was: ""You have high levels of anxiety and depression, do tasks for 30 mins max and switch to something else, socialize and go out more and do something productive to increase your dopamine levels"".

It did not help. At all. And I can't go to more therapy sessions for 2 reasons: 1) I don't think it's going to help at all. 2) I can't afford it. I mean, my mother will pay for it but we've been in financial crisis for the past 4 years and I don't want to burden them more than I already have. I've had suicidal thoughts since 8th grade (I'm in 12th grade now). I was bullied and ""roasted"". AA used to say many hurtful things and would gaslight me by saying ""It's just a joke dude"". AA always had his way with words into shifting topics and twisting words. Once I caught him red-handed doing that and he replied with ""I'm AA, what did you expect?""

Man. I'm tired. It's been a month and I'm in the gutter. I'm having sharp pains in my chest, I feel like puking and crying but my tears won't flow. I get horrible anxiety attacks where I hyperventilate to the point of blacking out and I can't even eat anymore. I can't enjoy what I used to enjoy. Everyday when I take the train I think of jumping in front. And while walking on roads I walk in the middle of it when it's empty, I think about jumping from the 6th floor. I think about cutting myself. But I'm such a weakling both ways. I'm a weakling if I don't have the guts to do it to myself and I'm a weakling for quitting life if I do. Everything reminds me of A. Literally everything. No one can replace her. No one can love me the way she did.",1639399098.0

I'm a graphic designer 25 years old, in my earlier years I've been always in constant pressure in what's the purpose of my own life and I recently have a panic attack about it, which is not common but I was not impressed either.

&#x200B;

Why did I have a panic attack ? because I have a friend who was getting my attention but when she talked about having sex I just get so embarassed because I never in my life had sex with anyone and  I couldn't do it. and she just left me because I couldn't do it, I didn't want to dissapointing her because I really enjoyed the time we passed together and I feel so sad because people have sex on this age and I feel so bad at myself but there's not only that problem, I was feeling lonely and trashy after that but I realized is because nothing in my life is really worth it for living, I feel worried, I think i'm a failure in my job, and I feel this is totally non sense, did I have depression ? I know having sex with someone won't solve the problem, I just feel insatisfied with every aspect of living, I really want to talk with a professional but I live with my parents and I will feel so bad if they know how bad I feel.

762,Struggling with separation,"Throwaway account here, reposting here because it feels more appropriate than /r/depression

I know everyone has problems. Particularly right now in this political climate and pandemic, many people are just angry all the time. I've seen my family members succumb to depression and substance abuse. And I wanted to be one of those people who was there to help others in need while doing my best to help my family. I am just struggling to keep going now, and I don't know what to do.

A bit of my background. I'm 41. I've been married for a bit over 5 years to someone I've known and cared about for 15. We were friends for a long time, and decided 8 years ago to try to be more than friends. She had a kid from her previous marriage, I lived 2000 miles away, and she had a number of other issues as well, including BPD. As of right now we have a 4 year old and I've adopted her 11 year old daughter (did so 3 years ago). And as of two months ago she just told me she no longer loves me or finds me attractive, or that she cares about me but isn't in love with me.

I've known for a while that things weren't well between us. She seemed always angry. When dealing with her own issues with anxiety and depression, she returned to weed usage. She renounced her faith. I called her out on a lot of this, feeling that her behavior was erratic and unacceptable. Her remarks how she didn't want to be a mother anymore were particularly bothersome. I responded with anger towards this, telling her she could leave and she'd be nothing to me while I continue as I had been being the best dad I could be. I know this was the wrong response, and I deeply regret it. I know I also cannot change what I've said.

Two months ago my daughter's cat died. The next day my wife told me she wanted to bring her old high school friend (whom she had done harder drugs with in the past) into our home during the pandemic for a non-disclosed period of time. I learned later that this was because he was coming out of the closet, and needed my wife for support. I was not comfortable bringing a drug using stranger into our home, so I told her no. She then asked if she could pay him back for his airfare, which I also said no to. I went so far as to ask if he could get a hotel here, and maybe they could just spend time together there. All of this made me very uncomfortable. And it was after this that she demanded to separate our finances, and was fairly constant in her hostility towards me. I was worried that she didn't just want financial independence, but wanted to leave me. Of course my fears would be confirmed, but I wanted so very much to trust her.

After she confronted me on her lack of feelings for me, fully expecting me to fight, I told her that I still loved her, and that she would not be prisoner of this home or of our marriage. If she really felt the way she felt, then I wanted her to be happy and free. She wasn't sure how to respond, and we ended up having sex. In the morning she said, ""Maybe I just want to separate for now."" She stressed that she needed to leave for the kids, because she cannot be a good mother living with me. In later mediation sessions, she would state that she definitely doesn't want to get the courts involved. She even said to me many times that she still loves me.

Just before she moved out, she gave me a book on BPD that she was going to just put into a box for goodwill. She said if I wanted to read it, it'd give me a clue about how she thinks and what she's going through. Naturally, I read it, and I'm re-reading it.

Through mediation with our former marriage councilor, we were able to agree how to separate our finances and divide custody of the kids. We're splitting time 50/50 right now, and she's agreed to stop smoking weed. By all accounts I can trust her on this, and she's kept to her agreement for now as well. At our last session, she stated she wanted to end mediation, and didn't give a reason. With some urging, I convinced her to do another session in one month. One thing that really stood out was that she said she didn't care if I read the book on BPD or not, because she was just going to trash it anyway. But then later she said I'm the only friend she had that wants to know about it, and even recently some of her online friends stopped talking to her after she admitted she had BPD.

A little over a week ago she moved out; My best friend and I helped her. Though the process her demeanor has gone between professionally civil to rude.

My oldest isn't taking it well. She is happy being with her mom, but also considers the home I'm still in ""her home."" She tells me each day that she really wishes mom would move back here, but knows she can't convince her. My son is somewhat oblivious to the whole thing, just aware that he now has two homes and two beds. Our expressions towards our kids are not the healthiest either. My wife is still often angry, and I'm told she regularly yells at the kids, while my daughter tries to make her happy. On the flip side, I find it hard to stop crying, and my kids are trying to cheer me up all the time while I ask them not to and tell them that my job is to be there for them, not the other way around.

This brings me to the point of all this. I'm getting advice, maybe too much advice. I'd characterize it as follows:

**Team hate** \- Old friends that are just hearing about my marriage or marriage issues:

""That bitch needs to get the hell out of your life. You won't be happy until she's gone. Kick her to the curb, be mean to her, give her no quarter. I would be mean to her if I was in your shoes; she's an unfit mother and a bad person.""

I tend not to listen to these people; their statements are just a little too hostile for me.

**Team end it** \- My therapist and a few friends:

""You are still caring for her, when she's not caring for you. You need to seize the initiative and take the divorce into your own hands. Serve her papers, get things legally documented, establish boundaries, and end your relationship. You shouldn't see her or talk to her unless it's absolutely necessary for the kids. She's clearly abusing you, and for the sake of your kids and to keep you from killing yourself, you need to break the cycle. Once you do, you can heal and start dating again. You deserve to be loved by someone good.""

I suspect her therapist is telling her something similar about me.

**Team wait -** My closest friends who've known me longest and have first hand seen the abuse.

""Her behavior is unacceptable, and you're better than the way you've been treated. She's going through a lot and so are you. This separation is good for everyone, well, maybe not the kids. But you need to focus on yourself. Work out more. Eat better. Don't drink. Work on your hobbies and projects that you've been neglecting. Have fun! And in time, maybe you'll work things out, maybe you won't. The point is, you'll be better off, and you'll either have the woman you love back, or you'll love someone else.""

This is the advice I listen to the most, though it leaves me unfulfilled and unsure about what I'm supposed to do.

**Team believe** \- A few friends who used to be her friends and the pastor of my church.

""Your therapist is wrong; she's paid to support you and doesn't care about your marriage. Your wife still loves you, and you still love her. She's just going through a lot. If you look at society today, marriage is all too easy to end, and for dumb reasons. Ending your marriage is stupid; you guys clearly are good for each other, even if things are toxic as they are. Yes, separation can help stop the toxicity, but that friendship can be rebuilt and should be. If you love her, keep working to reconcile. She wants to be friends? Great, give her space and time... it's only been a week. Be friends when you can be, talk through your problems, recognize how you both contributed to the cycle of abuse, and grow together. Right now the ball's in her court. Your job is to be patient, and don't give up hope.""

This is the advice I want to believe the most. That hope is killing me, however.

&#x200B;

The problem I have now is that when I am alone I want to talk to her and resolve things. I want to work though things with her. But she is not willing to talk to me as a friend right now. It's been 8 days since we officially split up, though the separation trouble has been going on for over a month. We're at the point where we trust each other enough not to screw each other over (no need to get lawyers involved), so I'd say overcoming that was a major accomplishment. But with everything else I just keep reliving the past several months and wanting to say and do things differently, to be more supportive, to be more understanding, to be less offended. I should have heard what she was feeling, and not what she was saying. My therapist would say I cannot beat myself up, and that her words (while maybe not meant) were still hurtful and my responses were reasonable.

Here's where it gets much worse. My best friend was the best man at my wedding. His wife was a bridesmaid and is also my cousin. I had hoped my cousin would maintain her friendship with my wife, and yesterday I asked her not for advice, but for information. This, it turns out, was terribly inappropriate. I put her in a difficult position where she'd feel she was betraying a confidence to my wife and also maintaining her loyalty to her cousin. I fucked up. To her credit, she didn't really give me any information. But I got an angry message from her husband / my best friend this morning:

""You already apologized. Don't ever do that again.""

In my quest to find out what I should do, I've eroded trust with my support network. I've feared for a while that I've been reaching out to too many people for advice and help, and that I'd wear them out with my needy feelings for validation and support and advice.

I know I need to find the strength within myself to do what's right for me. But I'm still caught between the three problems of ""do I hope,"" ""do I disconnect and try not to care,"" or ""do I just end it and stop suffering?""

I have the kids to consider: they want my wife and I to get back together. They want to live in a non-broken home. My kids are by far my top priority; just being without them for a few days kills me. And it's not like I haven't spent time away from them in the past (they've spent time at my parent's home).

I have my wife to consider: If she wants to love someone else, I don't want to stop her. If she wants space to work on herself without having to worry about a relationship, I don't want to stop her. If she is a better mom not living under the same roof as me, then I want her to be a better mom. I just also want to support her, be her friend, and love her as I have. I know she needs space and I respect that. I just also miss her terribly. I'd be totally okay still married to her and separated forever, if I knew that she could love me again.

I have my friends to consider: the longer this drags out, the more burdensome I am on them. Already I feel I've pissed off my best friend for my poor actions. I see friends backing away when I cry. At what point is the only source of support I have my therapist?

I have myself to consider: I love her so much. But I know I can't bear her hurting me anymore. I tried so hard this last weekend to focus on some sort of healthy tasks that I could do. I just... didn't have it in me. I ended up spending my time watching Netflix on a pirated account while I slept on the couch. My neck still hurts, but it's just so hard to be in the bed my wife and I shared. My finances are half what they were, so I can't go out and just spend a bunch of money to live it up. There's also a pandemic which makes meeting new friends basically impossible.

And through it all I just feel so low. I'm trying, but I feel like the more I try, the worse I do. I just don't know if I can keep doing this hope or pain. I know my kids depend on me; that's basically the only thing keeping me away from darker thoughts. I'm just so tired of crying all the time. I'd give anything right now to just not be here in this place and time, and to not be me. I feel delusional, stupid, and ultimately worthless. I'm trying to work, but everything just takes so much effort.",1619472814.0
763,I haven't gotten out of bed for over a week.,"Over the past week, I haven’t gotten out of bed, rarely showered, and have eaten only candy. I have been facing depression since 2013 and my life has been a rollercoaster ride ever since. What usually happens is that I engage in life for a couple of months before spiraling by browsing the Internet all day for weeks or months. I’ve dropped out of school twice and almost lost a job because of this pattern. I’m so tired of my shortcomings. I don’t care that I’m not alone in facing these. It’s the fact that I’m facing this problem in the first place. For over five years I’ve been in therapy, and I take five pills a day. I have honestly tried my best to manage my depression, but it seems no matter how long I am a productive member of society, every so often I end up back on my bed browsing the Internet for weeks at a time. This is not normal. My production varies more wildly than a neurotypical person.

There’s a common argument that I should never give up because there is always a solution for someone. The problem is that I am exhausted at trying to find the right solution. Let’s say it takes me 200 tries to get to a point where I can consistently manage my depression, and I currently am on my 23rd try. Am I supposed to keep going for the next 177 tries, not knowing that the current try is the one that will fix this mess? I’ve been trying for 8 years to get this under control and I just cannot pull through. I have a support system. I have a therapist. I have a psychologist. I have friends. I take medicine. I have been to the psychiatric hospital. I do all the things I’m supposed to do and I’m still inconsistent. 

I don’t care that I do well for periods of time, I want to do well *all* the time. I understand everyone has their bad days, but it happens to me at an intensity and duration that I do not accept. I don’t want to have these back-breaking, weeks-long slumps that cost me thousands of dollars of lost work. Each time I fail, I have a little less patience with myself. This is becoming unsustainable. I don’t want to live this way.

I don’t know what I’m asking here. Maybe I need to just give up the Internet forever. This is the first time I laid all my personal business on a public forum like this. I’m so desperate for some solution to this. I just want this to go away.",1613757040.0

### PREFACE
This mega thread aims to help those struggling with loneliness by solving the core issue that is social anxiety. 

### MY STORY
_skip if you just wanna get to the actual question_

Let's start from the very beginning.

As a little kid in Playgroup/Kindergarten, I was one of the shy and timid boy in class. During playtime, I would always end up being outcasted from the group because I wasn't able to get my share of the toys in class. I would let the other kids have their way with the toys, while I just sit back and watch from the corner of the class. This general lack of assertiveness would continue until the rest of Elementary School.

Throughout Elementary School, I was relentlessly bullied by my peers, and as a result have developed a _""me against the world""_ mentality. Many kids would pretend to be my friend, only to team up with the bullies and screw me over in the end. Teachers and headmasters didn't care for my situation, and instead participated in the bullying as well. I remember vividly when one of my ""friends"" falsely accused me of cheating in a test, and my teacher wouldn't even bother to listen to me while he was dragging me across the class over towards the principle's office. This bullying from my classmates and teachers would cause me to develop a general mistrust against peers and authority figures.

In Jr. Highschool, things got a lot better and also a lot worse. I learned to be more loud and flashy. I made a lot of friends and hung out with the popular kids a lot. With that said, I was still an awkward kid in class. I was still the wierd kid of the bunch, and never really felt like I fitted in my class. Now this is where everything went south. At the second year of Jr. Highschool, I was scolded over a meme I made at the time. And the reason how the meme got found out by the teachers in the first place is because one of my friends drew them out on the school whiteboard and someone took a picture of it. This incident brought back a lot of my childhood trauma, the mistrust against friends and teachers. This slowly brought me back to the miserable state I was in, and it's only getting worse as I approach Highschool.

As I graduated Jr. Highschool, I was separated from the majority of the friends I used to hung out with. They either got transfered to a different school or was assigned to a different class than mine. Coupled with the general anxiety that my childhood fears might turn into reality this senior year, I gone through Highschool with the fear of interacting with people. This is also when I discovered about atheism and how god isn't real. I found out about the deep web and discovered all of the terrible things humans do to each other. I found out about philosophy including cynicism, nihilism, and existentialism. All of this made more and more cynical about the world, almost adopting this post-humanist mindset that every human being is inherently evil. All of this made me really bitter and resentful, yet also fearful towards everyone including myself.

I'm currently in my first year of uni. Because of the pandemic we couldn't do much socializing, so nobody really got the chance to bully anyone. But for 2021, my uni is planning to stop online and go back to normal. This is giving me all of the anxiety back. I fear that I will go through uni the same way I gone through Elementary and Highschool. I don't want to experience that anymore.

### WHY I WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE
I found out that having a bunch of friends/being popular makes you less likely to be bullied. You also get a lot of perks like: people treat you with respect, more opportunities, and they just don't treat you like garbage. I also feel really lonely at times, and researches show that chronic loneliness is generally detrimental for our mental health.

# QUESTION
How do I even begin to talk to people if I already feel avoidant towards them to begin with? How do I regain trust towards people in general? How do I stop being socially awkward and anxious all the time?

Over the years, I was always told _""you should just talk to a bunch of people, practice socializing so you can get good at socializing!""_ In practice, this advice never goes well. I would approach people, then the anxiety kicks in, hence I get avoidant, awkward, and quiet, and the other person just end up feeling uncomfortable being around me and avoids me altogether. Practicing this advice has done nothing but make me feel even worse about myself.

I think another issue that I'm having is this general cynicism towards life and humanity in general. Being cynical about everyone and the things we do just makes me even more avoidant towards people. I wanted to ask this question as well, but perhaps this would be too much to ask since I already have three question marks in the first paragraph.

765,One year ago today I almost killed myself...But now I’m better,"As my dramatic title suggests on December 16, 2019 I almost killed myself. I had realized I had no direction in life and tons of expectations heaped onto me and I saw no way out other than ending it all. I sit in front of my keyboard today one year removed and I can tell you I don’t recognize the man I was then. I’ve spent the last 7-8 months dealing with the consequences of my actions instead of killing myself. I’ve failed out of college, I disappointed my family, I lost friends because I lied so much to keep up my facade. But I lived. I got myself a job, the family that is disappointed in me decided to accept me once they heard I almost killed myself, some friends have reached out to make sure I’m doing alright. I realize I’m extremely lucky in these respects and many others wouldn’t be. But these were things I couldn’t see back then and so maybe by posting this maybe I can put into perspective something that other people aren’t seeing. The glimmer of hope on the horizon. It is now my “Year 2” and I have decide to write down how I feel at this point in the year every year from now on. I hope this inspires others to look for anything in their life that can be worth living for that maybe they just aren’t seeing. Think long and hard and realize you are never alone in the world. I’m not in the best shape yet. It’s only been a year. I still struggle with things like depression, relationships, and alcoholism but it’s time to focus on moving forward and changing my mindset.",1608093058.0
766,I'm fucking scared,"My mental health has been a mess lately and I‘ve driven myself insane with the pressure I give myself and the expectations others have. School is like hell- we have so much class tests at the moment and although I give my best, I still feel like a piece of shit.
Since I don’t feel that comfortable talking with my parents about my problems, I talked with friends and someday decided to go to a special teacher at school who deals with problems like that (I don’t know what the english word for that is-)
Anyway, the first meeting was a few weeks ago and it actually helped. But sooner or later my mental health took a really bad turn and I started to get suicidal. Everything was just too much. Regularly I would cry while being in class and even try to cut myself. (Like I said- a mess)

And someday my teacher suggested to talk with my parents. And today- the talk will take place in the school. And I'm so incredibly scared. I had been doing really good the past few days but yesterday when my mom was mad again because she doesn’t understand why there’s a meeting and why I'd rather talk to a stranger than to my parents. And ofc it’s always my fault. In her pov I don’t have any problems. My stress isn’t real, I'm faking everything, it ain't that bad. Well this hit me very hard and since she said “If they talk about getting professional help and [that kind of bullshit]...” I'm just incredibly scared because, in fact, my teacher wants to suggest me getting real help. But my parents don’t understand that.
So I cried yesterday like hell, panicked like gell and cut myself to the point where I didn’t care wether I would live or end up dying. But luckily my friends talked to me and I somehow stopped cutting.

But now's the day and I'm so incredibly scared. I feel like throwing up. I feel like cutting myself again. I feel like running away. Actually, my parents are very awesome but when it comes to mental health, I just hate it here.

I don’t know if this really belongs here, but I just wanted to get this off of my chest. Thank you for reading.",1606974175.0

Around that time I was healthy and fit had a really close group of friends and then everything changed. I left to go to my last duty station in my contract around that time and from that point on boom just a complete downward slope. I feel like I can't bring myself to do anything I once enjoyed. Since I got out of the Navy I have virtually no friends like I once had and I'm constantly anxious. I don't know if I'm just being lazy and feeling like self pity or what my problem may be.

768,"The more you think about a negative memory, the more negative it gets","I'm not sure if this happens to everyone or just me, but I've noticed this. Sometimes, something negative will happen to me. And I will think ""wow this sucks, but moving on"". Then at home, as I'm ruminating, I remember what happened and some how every detail of the story becomes really negative/bad and all of a second I feel incredibly bad thinking about this memory again.

I didn't realize how terrible it was until I discussed with a childhood friend of mine about a memory that only she and I shared. My whole life, that ""experience"" made me feel sad, ashamed and anxious but as we talked and she gave me her side of the story I realized that I distorted a LOT of what actually happened and it made me feel unnecessarily worse. 

I'm also trying to overcome a really negative memory from school right now that I thought I got over a long time ago. When I was in middle school, I got caught in an ugly misunderstanding and was considered a terrible person by pretty much everyone and no one believed me when I tried to say how things actually went. I was forced to apologize for something I didn't do and even though people around me ""moved on"", they ""moved on"" with the idea that I was the culprit and it was just such a huge pill to swallow for me. I keep thinking how today some people might still believe it's how things went even though I'm pretty sure no one involved remembers that story anymore.

My head hurts a lot and it feels like a constant mild panic attack. Everything I do I seem to question. This was exactly how I felt a year ago when I was suicidal. I don't know what I did to make things so bad again. I thought I had beat these emotions but everything seems like shit again. Maybe it won't last for a long time today, but I know I've not improved now. This is proof of it. I can't do this all over again.

770,I'm so tired of struggling and I need to vent it out. My life is great but I'm spiraling out of control. Any advice and similar experiences welcome. (warning: I cuss a bit in my post),"Hi I'm 22 and have been struggling with anxiety, depression, and ptsd for years. My therapist is fantastic and has managed to keep me out of the hospital, but I'm just at a point in my life where I can't take it anymore. So here's a no holding back post for strangers on the internet. I don't know what I need or what I should do. 

My anxiety has always been There. I take medication and cope the best I can, but it is always a struggle and often I still have panic attacks. In the last few months it has ramped up to being intolerable. In the last month I'm beginning to feel suicidal. 

Major stress point one: Uncertain about my job and I can't find any answers for myself on whether I want to stay in the field or fuck it all and go work at Kroger. Change careers. 

I have a good job with a good company. The way my work is structured is hard to explain so long story short. The agency I work for I'm still hired under, but I quit with my contractor and told them I'm quitting all together. I worked so many hours outdoors and put my body through the paces for over a year and with the virus I got a month off. In that month I just felt like fuck it! Who cares I hate this shit anyway. So I told the contractor I'm not coming back. Thing is I still like my line of work, but maybe I want to change anyway? Do something else?


Major stress point two: I just moved out of my parents for the first time. My apartment is still a mess even though I'm trying. 

I just moved out and I'm having a hard time defining my life for myself now. My parents were always incredibly over bearing and invaded my daily life constantly. Without them now I feel free but lost. I don't know how to make choices for myself and I feel like a constant fuck up.

Major stress point three: Everything is going right for me so why am I not happy!!

I have a beautiful fiance and a good relationship. My job is going great if I can keep up with it. I have good insurance. I have a nice apartment and everything I need. Not really financially stressed right now.
Why. am. I. not. okay.
I don't understand why everyday is a stupid struggle to be me. I don't understand why my brain constantly feels like cracking open. 
I feel like the world is better off without me and I know that's wrong. Logically I know better, but it's so overwhelming and I can't take it anymore.

What the hell is happening?? How do I not be such an idiot. How do i get help.

Stress point four: I drink. a lot.

I have been switching between smoking weed, nicotine, and alcohol. It seems when I quit one I pick up the other. I can't fucking do this anymore! I drink almost every day now and I feel like I can't have a good day if I don't have a beer or a whiskey or whatever. It makes my body feel like shit. Do I just like torturing myself?? 

I have a psychiatrist, but I don't feel comfortable telling them that I need stronger meds or SOMETHING because they're so worried that I have an addictive personality. This may be true, but I have problems coping because I feel so stressed out, so maybe if I were less stressed I wouldn't have any addiction issues. 

Trying to pick up yoga to help myself but I honestly can't face my problems anymore. Every time I think about doing it I get such an anxiety spike I want to blow my head off. Fuck me.

I'm below average mood but ""fine"" in the summer. But I can't live through another winter. I'm constantly cold. It gets below 0 all the time here. I can't stand seeing snow. I'm constantly worried something in my car will fail and cost thousands of dollars to fix, or I'll get hit by a shitty driver. It's too cold to walk anywhere and get fresh air.

I thought I might be depressed, and I've been to doctors about it over the past five years. Different brands of antidepressants did nothing for me but show me that my lack of success is the cause of my depression, which meds of course can't fix. I don't have hundreds of dollars to keep wasting on doctor's appointments that don't help.

I miss the futures I dreamed of, miss the feeling that I was on the precipice of a better tomorrow.

One of them is in my life still and although I rarely see them, every time I do, they avoid me like the plague. I recently was at an event and they were there. I saw their face as they noticed me and it was one of anger and disgust, they hate me. They absolutely hate me. I would apologise but they won't be in my presence. I feel so bad about what I did, I was selfish and didn't think my actions would hurt other people.


A while back I realised this could be the source of my guilt, my self hatred, my depression and anxiety. I don't know how to go about dealing with it. I feel like I am human garbage and never deserve to be happy again. When therapists and confidants tell me about what I should be focusing on or that I deserve to be happy, I can't help but think that I genuinely don't but I haven't told them why I feel like this. They don't know what I've done, they think I'm just sad or hormone-deficient, but honestly, I just hate myself.


This self hatred has held me back so much and been the crux of all my attempts on my life. I have depression because I feel like I am the biggest piece of shit out there and I have anxiety because I feel like in a moments notice, I'll fuck my life up with one mistake like I did all those years ago or someone will find out and everyone will hate me. If that happens, no hesitation, I will kill myself. I feel such shame already, the only thing worse is my family knowing and being ashamed of me.


I wish I could go back and fix things before they got like this but I don't deserve it. Underneath all this facade is a piece of selfish shit who doesn't deserve to be happy. I hurt others badly, I did something I can never forgive someone else for, so forgiving myself is near impossible.

I think this is leading me to feel apathetic about doing anything  because I'm afraid that the joy will be fleeting and it's not ""real"" to say. I've been that way since my mom died because I truly feel like I lost by best friend at 26 years old. It was a very quick and unexpected death and I had to take over the household along with two younger (but legal) brothers. I just feel stressed out over having to take over everything and helping out with my family. I just feel like life is just a black pit and there's no point in doing anything because we all die and either there's gonna be nothing but eternal oblivion at the end or some sort of afterlife (which I would be happy for because I would potentially see deceased love ones again). I tend to think of myself as a ""weak agnostic"" and I wonder if that has anything to do with it. I take zoloft and klonopin and see a therapist when I really feel like I need to process things, but I feel like I'm not making any progress.

781,"Rant on condescending people who don't ""get"" that having mental illnesses will cause setbacks?","I still live with my parents and am not in a place where most 20 somethings are at because of some severe difficulties that I had to deal with for a good chunk of my late teens and early twenties, which of course isn't something that just suddenly goes away either.

I'm still further along than I thought I would be, and I'm moving at my own pace and I'm proud of myself for that because I know where I use to be.  But there are always people who judge you harshly simply because you're not where you are by society's standards.

 Some people are so disgustingly condescending about it.  Do you really think people enjoy having mental illnesses and difficulties in life? Do you think people enjoy having to be set back because of it?

782,"Mental Health Awareness, Representation, and Education…Why it Matters (blog)","Mental health is a subject that is bound to impact every person at some point. Throughout your life, you may find yourself dealing with grief, a family member struggling with grief or a friend dealing with trauma. In reality mental health it just as relevant and common as physical health. Unfortunately, stigma and the lack of education surrounding mental health has made it taboo. So let’s get real on mental health.

Problem

Let’s start with the problem of representation.

Entertainment: TV Shows and movies often portray mental health as stupid, unnecessary or scary. Characters with mental health issues are either seen as unable to function or freaks. Therapists are seen as unhelpful or even an enemy. Even when the show or movie tries to get it right it is still full of stereotypes and misinformation regarding therapy and mental health in general.

Fact: Mental health professionals are well educated holding Maters or Doctorates in the area of counseling and psychology. Add this to hands-on experience, it can sometimes take 9 to 15 years or more of education and training just to be licensed. They are also subject to many legal and ethical guidelines just like medical doctors.

Social Media: Many people feel they are doing their part if they share a meme or post about mental health. They are drawn to the pretty picture or the way the words sound important. Unfortunately, many of these shares contain false information or damaging representation of mental health.

Fact: Introverts are not socially challenged, OCD is not someone who is just really organized, Trauma is related to events with the real or perceived threat of death (not based on your feelings getting hurt or something that scared you!), sociopaths are not murderers…people with mental health disorders are not “crazy” and mental health professionals hate to be called shrinks. The takeaway here is to educate yourself before sharing content.

Impact

What does this misrepresentation lead to?

Stigma: It is hard to admit you are having a problem if you think this problem makes you weak, crazy, or lesser in some way.

Fear: No one wants to go to a person for help they feel is not really going to help them or is going to harm them in some way.

False information: People down-play or up-play issues because of what they think they know about a particular issue.

Fact: It is likely that everyone will experience issues with their mental health at some point, if not multiple points in their life.

Fact: Like physical health most mental health issues are “curable” or manageable with proper treatment.

Fact: Most client and issues are treatable with short term care. As in months, not years.

Importance

Making the change

Breaking the Stigma

When mental health is seen in more of a positive way people are more likely to seek help.

Fact: Suicide ranks as the 10th cause of death in the United States. Yet only half of those suffering from severe depression choose to get help. Of these, men makeup 80% of the suicides yet are far less likely to seek counseling services due to stigma.

Helping Others

A society that understands mental health will be more likely to recognize red flags within friend and family groups.

Fact: On a personal level, I lived in an abusive life from birth until age despite having all of the signs.

Helping Ourselves

When we learn to embrace our own mental health we are able to find ways that help up live a better quality of life.

Fact: Mental health and physical health go hand in hand. When we struggle in one area we will then struggle in other, making it important to find a balance.

What you can do:

Education, Representation, and awareness

Education: Take the time to educate yourself through scientifically backed information presented by real professionals.

Representation: Support content that properly represents mental health and take the time to address and correct harmful information.

Awareness: Share content and information with others.

So when i discovered that even my closest friend were such a dick , I just went down emotionally . We are currently 12:49 ... It happened a uh ... 10:22 aproximatively (why am i telling this?) . I'm just so angered against him . I just can't handle it . I just don't know what to do with this .

785,Dealing with Depression and Self-Hate for Decades... The only motivation I have is Spite,"I want to give you guys some context before we go any further down this mess of unhelpful behaviors. I'm 28 years old, a Chinese American Man, tinder attractive at 10% body fat... fucking ugly otherwise, and I've just diagnosed with Cancer a month ago. I'm actually okay with the cancer. It's Primary Mediastinal Non Hodgkins Lymphoma, and seems mostly survivable. It's the other parts of my life that have dragged me down for years, and I'm not sure how to deal with it. 

&#x200B;

I'm not mentally healthy. I've been depressed and self-hating since I was 12 years old. I was hospitalized as a teenager for Suicidal Ideation, and was prescribed prozac, ability, and respirital which I eventually stopped during the beginning of college because I felt these drugs slowed down my thinking processes. I just accepted it as a truth that I hated myself, and life was worth living, because the other shits and giggles (experiences) were worth it.  I hated my appearance. When I saw myself in the mirror, I saw Bobby Lee, or Ken Jeong from the Hangover. I didn't see an Asian man with a thin face and dignity. I didn't hate myself for being Asian, but I hated myself, for not being this 'Ideal Image' of an Asian man. I hated seeing the happy pictures others posted on social media, and while I have a social life, how hesitant I was to actually see pictures of myself. There were other hobbies that motivated me. I like to draw watercolors, and learned arts such as Capoeria because it was fun at the time. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, I just floated around, and eventually, a year out of college, I met a woman who seemed out of my league (attractiveness). I fell hard for her, even while I still hated myself. We were together for three years. I went out of my way to do everything and anything for her, and in the end, it wasn't enough. 'I' wasn't good enough, and she left me. 

&#x200B;

This event turned the 'Self-Hate' notch up to a 10. I was mature about the break-up and didn't bother her after she left me, but it made me desperate to do anything that could give me 'self-validation'. She left, and started dating someone who was taller, and more 'attractive'. I decided I wasn't worth anything until I could sleep or be in a relationship with a woman more attractive than my ex, as well as be more attractive than the version of myself that she rejected, and how others perceive me. I went out clubbing, as well as on OkCupid, and it just struck me... how low on the dating pole I was. There was a 'league' I wanted, and a 'league' that told me exactly what I was worth. This built into resentment. I try not to think of myself as better than anyone else, in that we're all deserving of love and happiness. But yes, I am superficial as fuck, and the idea of anyone else thinking they were better than me just fueled my spite and need to improve myself. 'Getting over it' means using the self-hate and spite as fuel.

&#x200B;

I spent years at the gym, running, turning my Capoeira skills into Calisthenics, until I could do handstand pushups, Planches, Bridge Pushups, etc. cut my body fat to 10%, until the fat face was gone. For the first time in decades I could look in the mirror, and not hate myself. I started dating women way above my old 'league', and I was satisfied. My ex left me because I wasn't good enough for her. But I won. I beat her. It didn't matter if I was happy or not. I had my dignity. The people on tinder who swipe left on me, or dudes who can height block me can think themselves better as well. Fuck them. I can do handstand pushups. I can live with myself because I am the best version of myself.  

&#x200B;

I'm in a relationship with a sweet girl for a year now. She's very cute, and 'above my league'. She met me when I was Cut, and accepted me for all my faults, even when I've let myself go, or when I'm strict with dieting. She was attracted to me superficially, but cares for me now because she loves me. But what remains, regardless, is a superficial realization, that yes... in American Culture, people do think of me as less of a man when I have less muscles. It's especially true when I'm 5'6 and Asian.  

&#x200B;

I still look in the mirror, and hate myself when I'm not completely cut. I hate that spite has been the only thing to turn my life around. I don't know how to fix this. I don't want to spend the rest of my life, being the best version of myself out of spite and jealousy of other's lifestyles. 

&#x200B;

And I can't wrap my mind around the idea either... that it's okay to love yourself just the way you are, without identifying every visible flaw that can be changed, and not work on changing it. To not worry about diet, gym, discipline... and to let yourself go... The cancer will take me down for a bit. I have to take it easy to recover. This said my plan is to go full out in exercise and work the moment it goes to remission. Because as fucked up as it is, people who thought they were better than me? They're getting married, older, unmotivated. And they're letting themselves go. I can still be depressed and hate myself, but as long as I can do amazing calisthenics and stay the best physical version of myself. I am winning... This is Spite. This is wrong. This motivation is what gives me self-worth. It's fucked up and I don't know how to change.

I keep starting conversations with people just to fill the silence that you left me with. I keep hoping that one day you'll still come back..that you'll miss me enough to just pop up in my notifs.

I looked at your photos again. I wish I held your face more. Kissed you more. I've forgotten how you kissed me the first time. Was it as I was putting on my seat belt or after I told you that I didn't want to go home yet?

Let's hangout in your living room again. Tell me again why Elon Musk has no sense of geometry. Show me again the racoon from your window. Kiss me again while I'm talking so this time I can sufficiently notice that you're trying to catch my attention. 

Let's sleep together again. I want to hug and cuddle more this time. I shouldn't have kept turning away from you. Let's sleep together more than we did. 

It's an endless repeat, these thoughts. I keep going over that week over and over and over again. I keep going back to you. As though remembering can keep you from leaving and disappearing. 

But, already, the memories are starting to fade. I keep trying to recall your smell, but I can't. I keep trying to remember the feel of your lips and the motions of your kisses but I've forgotten. I don't want to forget you. I never wanted to lose you. 

But you never intended to stay. You just came to give me all these wonderful memories and then you left as abruptly as you arrived. 

I've been told to feel indignant at the way that you left me. Maybe I should. But then again, I can't. How can I? You were kind and considerate and respectful the entire time you were with me. Even the last message that you sent was one that was meant to not let me worry. 

Maybe you just disappeared because you couldn't face my emotions when you tell me that we can't continue talking. Maybe you chose that less than ideal option because it was what you thought was best for us. I would never have been able to let go instantly completely. I think you knew that. I want you to know that I understand. You did what you had to do. I'm just sad that it had to be over. 

I miss you. I'm going to keep missing you for a long, long time.

In the last year: I have had a car repossessed. I dropped out of school credits shy of my BA in accounting.  I haven't worked at a regular job. I got a DUI so I have no drivers license and owe the state 2525.25. Im depressed. I'm 10k behind on my child support. I have no plan no budget and no will to get out of bed. I have borrowed money off of everyone I know with no intent to pay back. I have lied to friends about extreme shit so they won't be mad about not paying off a sublettted apartment, and its electricity bill. I moved back in with an emotional abusive boyfriend so I at least have a roof over my head and a way to see my daughter. He's a multi millionaire button't give me a penny toward any debt and especially not my child support. I have thousands in student loans, 1000k credit card debt and about 60 dollars cash to my name. Also I'm an alcoholic. My family has distanced themselves from me...understandably.

I thought going to college would help me get away from the sadness of my breakup, but it's just taken me from my friends back home. I don't have anyone here I can talk to. A few professors seem to care and are helping me. The work is killing me though. I love programming, but these classes are so hard(I had very little background compared to the other people here) and they take so much time. I used to workout all the time but I just haven't had time for the past two weeks. I have one friend here and not a close one. I feel so mentally and physically exhausted. I had lots of friends in High school but I don't know how to make friends here. I'm so poor compared to everyone here. Right now my routine consists of going to class, programming/going to office hours for the rest of my day, churning out a paper, and then sleeping. I'm pouring my heart and soul into this right now and it's not enough. I'm honestly so scared. What should I do? I've been so productive for the past few weeks but it's just not enough.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the advice. I reduced my course load for next semester to try to avoid this happening again. I'm also going to visit family for Thanksgiving, and hopefully that will give me time to rest and get back on top of things. I also got some sleep last night.

We couldn't celebrate on my actual birthday because of my younger sibling's sports, and we couldn't even do it in the morning like we usually do because of my older sibling had work so all that made me feel pretty unimportant. I get why my family did it that way, but it just made me feel awful. I had a break down in the shower that night. recently I've been having break downs where i cry a lot about how everyone treats me like a little bitch, and then i get really mad,and pull on my hair and breath really heavily.

I didn't get anyone telling me happy birthday unless i told them it was my birthday first, I got some texts telling me happy birthday, but it was all from my family, and my mom probably told them to tell me happy birthday anyway. Wednesday of course was Halloween I wasn't invited to anything so i stayed home and cried.

794,How can I help girlfriend with her depression that is straining the relationship,"*TLDR at bottom.*

Hey everyone. I've been here before, but this time it isn't for me. it's for my girlfriend. basically a few months after we started dating, her depression came back (our new relationship kept it at bay a bit). she moved in with me a few months later. we are struggling because she is constantly negative. she lets small worries drown her thoughts all day and all night. it got worse when she switched to 3rd shift weekends, and then again when diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. 

some of her negative thoughts include how I am definitely going to leave her. I keep emphasizing that she is only creating self-fulfilling prophecies by making non-problems into problems. I have NO interest in leaving her. no matter how much I insist this, she keeps mentioning how it worries her. months of hearing this started to drive me crazy. this crazy feeling is what will ruin the relationship. not end it, but ruin it beyond repair. I will still support her, I just won't be able to deal with the negativity which will create distance and lack of communication. 

she recently started counseling, and I am proud of her, but there is no way it's going to be enough - I think she will need medication to bring even the smallest spark of positivity back. she is also certain she is going to die. I can relate to this, I am also a hypochondriac, but she thinks everything is an omen. today she mentioned how nothing was working for her (paycheck was shorted, papers she needs for lawyer couldn't be accessed, etc) and she took it as a sign she was going to ""kick the bucket"" soon. I know, she might sound crazy, but she is just overwhelmed. 

I am doing everything I can think of to help. I give her rides everywhere she wants to go (her car is junk and we are in the process of getting her one), buy flowers, make her breakfast, lunch, dinner, and work lunches, discuss how to think about problems logically instead of with emotions. the problem is she is constantly stuck with this ""burden"" loop. ""I don't want to be a burden"" is something I hear multiple times a week. it makes things extra frustrating because things that aren't a deal to me (like giving her a ride) are made into an argument because she won't want to go somewhere because she's a ""burden."" I am very tired of hearing this word. tired of hearing ""it's how I was raised"" as well when I mention how nobody thinks she's a burden and she is allowed to ask for help any time. I tried telling her that parents aren't perfect, and being raised to not ask for help is not the best advice a parent could give and that it's common for parents to have negative impacts on their children without realizing it. 

Like I said, I am not interested in leaving her. I have my problems too, so I understand her struggle, but I also don't know what more I can do to get her to try to help herself. 

**TLDR**

So I guess what I'm asking is, what can I do to bring any sort of positivity into a very depressed girlfriends life? Or how can I have an adult conversation about her problems (and why they aren't as big of a deal as she thinks) in a mature manner that she may take to heart?

796,Overcoming a lack of motivation,"Depression runs in my family. Both sides. I had awful depression as a teenager and I fought in many ways to not let it fuck up my life. After a few years of family not understanding I became one of the many people who hid it. Later, I decided I would do everything in my power to feel better. I volunteered. I ate extremely healthy and exercised regularly. I engaged in hobbies as much as I could. I started using an SAD light every day. I took vitamins. I went to support groups. I believed that I could recover. I did feel better, and I was able to get on with my life somewhat. 

But this was a band aid solution. The real problem was still inside, all these things only addressed the symptoms. I learned a lot when I started therapy. Finally I could get to the bottom of it and dig out all the false beliefs about myself that I had accrued over the years. Depression can be complicated. For me, there were a lot of contributing factors and a complete lack of protective factors. 

One thing I learned is that happiness is fleeting. Its an emotion and it passes like all the rest of them. Aiming for happiness is setting yourself up to fail. But we can aim for fulfillment. And this was crucial for me. I know a lot of people with depression suffer from issues with motivation and I am no different. But I could only start to deal with this when I stopped resisting it. I had to completely accept myself just as I was. This meant totally experiencing that lack of motivation without judging myself for it or thinking that in some way it was bad.

It turns out I felt like that for complex reasons that can be boiled down to injury to my psyche over the years. The internal mechanics of my depression and lack of motivation were as unique as the journey that caused them. I had to stop judging it in order to really see it and understand it. I think depression can be seen as a kind of existential crisis. For me, totally accepting it allowed me to come face to face with a part of myself I had struggled to connect with before - my drive. It was underneath all those layers of judgement that came from both others and myself. There were layers of fear and defence mechanisms implicated as well. And there were the false beliefs. Underneath all that was a genuine sense of purpose that I had sort of known about but had been unable to harness productively.

For me, resisting depression and trying to control my emotions through lifestyle changes only distracted me from being able to confront and deal with the real problem. I had to embrace that feeling of being totally unfulfilled by life in order to come to a place where I could discover what would really make me feel fulfilled. I do not know if I will ever experience that seamless, effortless drive I had before I got depressed. But hitting rock bottom was the only way I could begin to find a real way out of my problem. 

For me, getting depressed was like one day, someone just switched off a light. It made life seem pointless. I don’t know if that light will ever go back on again, but I know that I have found a way to make my life have a point. Even if you are not there yet, you can find meaning in simply being depressed. As a part of grief, depression is important and meaningful in itself. As a chemical imbalance or a result of life circumstances, it can be a hero’s journey, a fiendish struggle in which you must battle all kinds of monsters to survive. No one would want any of this, but life as a depressed person is not a pointless struggle by any means.

The response we get to being depressed is usually that we should simply stop being this way. People often don’t understand that this is exactly what we spend most of our resources trying to do. I think other responses to people with mental health problems, like pity, are equally problematic. It is a horrible struggle I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy and it has taken incredible grit on my part to keep battling it every day. This struggle, which is shared by so many of us, is deserving of respect, not pity. Realising that I deserved respect regardless of my problems was central to being able to lay down self judgement. And that became a way out of my despair. It isn’t the ultimate answer and I have no guarantee about the long term impact it will have on my mood, but it is another foothold I can use to survive, and I am grateful for that.

797,How does becoming clear on how you feel helps you breakthrough it?,"Clarity is power in all aspects of our lives and emotions is no different. Often our minds play games on us deceiving us to believe that we feel a certain way whereas the reality is something different. 

One valuable habit that I developed over years was how to understand and become clear on how I really feel. 

When we become clear on our emotions, we have the power to change our actions and behaviors to get the results that we really want in life. 

So here are three questions that help you understand how you feel and what you could do to change it: 

Whenever you’re experiencing an unhealthy feeling, ask yourself: 

**1. How do I feel?** 

This question gives you an opportunity to slow down the roller coaster of emotions that drags you into a down spiral. This also gives you a chance to acknowledge how you feel which is also important in giving your feelings an outlet to avoid suppressing them. 

On the first attempt your answer might be something like, I feel angry, or I feel frustrated. 

This is how things look like on the surface. Now it’s time to get to go a bit deeper to figure out what your true feelings are. 

**2. How do I really feel?**  

Our minds need some time to absorb situations and to let things settle in before the mental and emotional fog dissolves and you could see things clearly. This is why you need to ask yourself a question that allows you to better understand your emotions. 

So asking yourself how do I really feel encourages you to connect to your heart and this is where the truth really lies. Whereas on the surface you could be feeling angry, deep down you could be feeling stuck and unable to make an important decision at work or back home. 

If we don’t give our emotions a healthy outlet and we keep running away from it, it will shape into a new emotion that causes us pain. 

**3. What can I do now to change this?** 

I mentioned before that our emotions are signals from our hearts and minds that we need to change something. This is why understanding our emotions is the first step towards changing our actions. 

So let’s say the you found out that anger is nothing but a new outlet to your frustration of not making the decision you know you have to make. 

In this case, you need to dig the real reason why you don’t make this decision. Fear of the consequences of your decision could be what’s keeping you stuck. In this case you could be thinking of strategies and tactics that reduce the risks of your decision. 

Clarity is the power of understanding and simplifying to take action and move forward. Do something different today to get a new result. 

Hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions

798,"I've been dealing with a very persistent depression episode lately, and I need help.","A (very quick) background: I've got really intense major depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, ptsd, and some baggage from an abusive/messed up childhood. I saw a therapist for a while but never got back to it when I moved for college. I take medication which helps me operate normally for the most part, but during periods of high stress or really sad moments can trigger a depression episode. Usually doesn't last more than 24 hours. Also because of financial trouble I've had to give up my life, move back in with my parents where I've been trying to save up money to get back on my feet, but have made zero progress.

Because of the abusive nature of my childhood, I grew up lacking a lot of normal social skills. I've had to learn most of them within the past few years, and its been tough and I'm still lacking some info. Because of this, I've only really had a handful of friends (less than 10 my entire life, and I'm 26). And right now, all of them are gone except one. That one is a complicated friendship/relationship that lives several hours away, and I haven't heard from them in over two weeks. I'm afraid that it might be over too. 

So as it stands now, I'm very lonely, broke, mostly broken, with a lot going against me. As a result, my intense depression episode which normally lasts a day has been going on for a week and a half now. No sucidial urges,but a LOT of morbid thinking (no impulse to act on any of it, just flooding my thoughts). I'm being crushed by the feeling that there's no hope at all anymore, and really, I just need as much help as I can get.

799,How do I stop comparing myself to others? I feel awful that my peers are more successful than I am,"All I have ever wanted was a decent paying job, relationship and kids.

I'm 25 years old. Up to this point in my life, I have accomplished nothing. I am in my 2nd year of college and work part time in retail. Every day I see people my age graduating, getting good jobs, married etc etc. It really gets to me after a while.

I know that you need to focu on yourself and that success is subjective. This is easier said than done however. I applaud everybody who makes it far but what about me? Depression and anxiety have destroyed me since I was a teenager. I have worked multiple jobs with barely any savings to show, started college late and STILL don't know what I want to do as a job. I hve such little motivation. I just hope that something will magically open for me. I know the key to success in theory but it's just much harder to do in person.

I was just browsing on facebook and found out my former high school mate is now a police officer. Acouple others are in med school and one is a captain in the army. I am just about to study for my exams (which already takes a lot of motivation) but this sunk me. I don't know. Here I am studying for college finals and these people my age are successful.

It makes me anxious. Will I ever get there? Will I ever even get halfway? I don't have high standards. All I want is an apartment, 45k a year and a girlfriend. Well I have the girlfriend already, but the other things... Success for me is now becoming stable. Becoming stable would be huge considering where I was at a few years ago but will I even get there? I don't know.

I was always on top of my peers while yunger. I was intelligent but I just lacked motivation, especially due to depression. Now it seems like they've all just sped past me. Am I jealous? I mean kind of. They should be happy but I get kind of sad seeing that it's not me in that scenario.

801,Laziness v/s Depression,"26M here. 

How do you differentiate between depression and laziness? 

Every day, all I feel like doing is playing videogames, eating junk and jerking off. I have absolutely no motivation to either go and work out or study/work. And the not working out and not studying part leads to an even worse mood. 

I feel lazy and stupid and horribly demotivated and have zero ambitions. This stupid shit has completely destroyed my self-confidence and I feel like my mind is in a pool of quicksand. My mind feels like it's working at half the speed it once used to. 

Is this just me being lazy or is this depression? Every online test I've taken has diagnosed me with major depression. But I feel like I've been using depression as a crutch to not study/work out. 

What do I do? (I cannot afford therapy or medication at the moment.)

How do I get a grip on myself?",1508828057.0
802,"PhDropout struggling to get back to normal life (employment, social activities, etc.) after dealing with chronic illness. Advice on how to start living the life I want, finding self worth and confidence, and developing structure.","tl;dr: Chronically ill PhDropout looking for help finding direction in life and getting shit done (aka garnering employment). Struggling with self worth, confidence, impostor syndrome, procrastination, and subsequently my career and life.

Hey /r/anxiety, I don't know if there's anybody here who could relate or help but I figured I'd make a post. I want to say that right off the bat I've been formally diagnosed with GAD and major depression, and that I've been on medication (10 mg Lexapro) which has noticeably improved my mental health. I start CBT next week and am very excited for my session.

Anyway, this time last year I was in a PhD program struggling with chronic sinus issues and endometriosis. I started having waning feelings about my research, the field I was studying, and academia as a whole. I've always been a very academically minded person and a PhD just seemed like a natural conclusion, eventually leading to becoming a professor, getting tenure, etc. By December I was struggling so severely with my physical health I took a full leave of absence for the following semester and took all incompletes for the fall. It felt so completely shitty at the time but looking back I had not other choice considering I was getting no work done. 

This March, after months of increasing depression symptoms, panic attacks, and procrastination, I decided to leave the program and get help. I felt relieved knowing I didn't have to do work I hated again and was optimistic about getting consulting gigs and more remote work given my physical health was really going downhill at this time. I applied to a few jobs when I officially was unemployed in June, but I don't really live in a great market for my field and quickly gave up after a few rejections. I started taking Lexapro and noticed an immediate shift from being so down all I did was cry in bed and have panic attacks to actually being excited about life. Since then I've also had surgery to remove endometriosis, which has vastly improved my QoL. I was to the point of claiming disability and just spent my days waiting for surgery, managing pain as well as I could without opioids. 

I'm now at the point where I feel physically fine but mentally can't get anything done. Basic things like making dinner, keeping hygienic, and making plans with friends all seem like a huge challenge I'd rather avoid. Since I'd like to work in data science I should be spending most of my days in front of the computer coding, but every time I even think about starting a tutorial for a skill I need to learn, let alone actually starting it, I get so scared and feel completely incompetent. I think I've convinced myself that all the work I've had previously in my field was due to luck and that without an academic support system my work won't be taken seriously. I even avoid making to-do lists which I know help me out and quell anxiety. I feel like my self worth and confidence are at all time lows, that I've lost a big part of my identity, and that I don't really know what I want out of life. I spend most of my days struggling with this, procrastinating on Youtube, and not getting much of anything done. I find it hard to care about getting a job and getting on and I want and need that to change. I used to be an incredibly motivated individual but the past 2 years I've noticed depression and anxiety creeping in and killing my work ethic. I like getting shit done but just getting to the doing part seems impossible given I mentally break down when I think of what I need to do. 

I know I'm smart and capable but I feel like I'm just holding myself back. I try positive self talk but can never really ""believe"" it, and I just end up in death spirals of negativity until I'm rendered crying on the floor. Any advice on how to cope after a big life shift and finding self worth would be super useful. Thanks!",1508444374.0

These programs are upwards of 30 daily sessions and the programs specifically teach you mindfulness techniques in good detail and encourage you to take these techniques into your day. Techniques include ""noting"", body scans and visualizations.

I'm an Arab American of Palestinian descent. I'm an atheist, but I was raised in a Muslim family. In the current political climate that we live in, I feel ashamed of my own ethnicity, and while I'm not actually Muslim, I still have a tendency to take statements about Muslims being dangerous, and Islam being an inherently violent religion personally, especially when other Liberals like Bill Maher are the ones making these arguments.

In addition, whenever I read about Islamic terrorist attacks, I always begin to feel terrible about myself, even though again, I myself am an atheist. When I heard about the Manchester bombing in particular, I fell into an extremely deep state of depression, to the point where I attempted suicide the next day. This was what led to the series of circumstances that resulted in my diagnosis for depression and anxiety.

As a whole, I feel personally affected whenever I read about a Muslim person whose a terrorist or a criminal who causes trouble in America or Europe, partly because I know it inevitably leads to people like Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, and of course, Donald Trump exploiting their anti-Muslim rhetoric, and partly because it makes me wonder if they're actually right, and that Arabs and Muslims really are some kind of scourge on the world. It honestly makes me wish I were born a white Christian or Jewish person, if only so that I wouldn't have to feel personally ashamed of something I have no control over.

But I'm also extraordinarily nostalgic, so I don't throw things away. And every so often I dig online to find those things I specifically blocked myself from seeing. I seek out the reminders of what I've had to move on from. 

I always feel a bit worse after doing so. And sure, it usually happens when I'm sick or had done setback that already has been down. 

I'm sure there are psychological explanations about depression/shame spirals and such. It's frustrating and disheartening to keep going through these ""two steps forward, one step back"" situations, even if the overall progress is forward. 

I need these things to be gone. But I don't want them to be. At this point, it feels like being stuck is practically a choice I'm making, a thing I'm doing to myself. Is it just a lack of willpower? Or is there something so deeply ingrained, this longing for what we thought was good (no matter what we rationally now see it to have been) that is hard wired?

I've always been a very sad person, since I was a kid. I've just lived a lonely and quiet life that has really influenced my personality growing up.

I delved into fantasy worlds and modern entertainment. Yet I really wanted to have a passion and find myself, I ended up putting all those hopes in going to university. 
I moved cities, and thought I could start a new life. But in 3 years nothing much happened. I ended up getting a bachelor's degree in something I just don't care about, I didn't gain any useful knowledge, and ultimately I know I wasted a lot of time and money for nothing in return.

I'm 21, I have no friends or acquaintances.

In this article above there are some interesting points about depression, it states that a lot of the troubles with depression has to do with a confused internal clock that damage the quality of the depressed person's sleep. The depressed push their sleeping habits further and further away from a normal sleep pattern because Serotonin is lowest in the morning which makes it's extremely hard to wake up.

The cure for this is to stay up all night and then go to bed 8pm the next day and then give yourself permission to sleep until 8am, accompany that with a light therapy lamp or equivalent sunshine the next day. Do all of this 3 times in total. So 36 hours awake time - 12 hours sleep - 36 hours awake time- 12 hours sleep - 36 hours awake time- 12 hours sleep. 

This should reset your internal clock and give you much more energy and better mood overall. I'm at the first sleep deprivation cycle so I can't say if it works for me, but the study says that 66 % of the participant beat depression with this coupled with  generic advice for better quality of sleep.

I'm in my senior year of college and suddenly everything went to shit.  I had an incredibly productive, yet stressful summer.  I worked two part time jobs, volunteered 15 hours a week, took 4 challenging summer classes and got A's in all of them.  It was a lot of stress, but I managed it pretty well.  At the end, I went on an incredible trip to shanghai with my boyfriend.  When the semester started, I feel like I just forgot how to care or something.

I can't sleep at night until about 4 in the morning.  I just lay there or find something else to do.  I can't unwind.  Then my alarm goes off at 830, and I either snooze it or sleep through it until NOON.  I've missed my morning classes almost every day for the whole semester.  Sometimes, I have trouble even making it to my 1:00 class.  Then I'm stuck managing the stress of trying to catch up on work all day and I can't handle it anymore.  I'm so overwhelmed.  My grades are in the shithole. I'm quickly losing all motivation to even try anymore. I want to go to grad school after I graduate, but I haven't even taken the GRE yet and it's the end of october. I had a project due yesterday with a classmate, I blew him off a couple times before we agreed to just meet a few hours before the project was due to share our data and write up the one page report.  I forged my data. I showed up a half hour late.  I felt like such a fucking asshole.

I went to the student health clinic on monday and told them about my sleeping trouble.  They gave me a few pills of ambien, and told me to take them around 11-12 to reset my sleep schedule. The doctor told me ""if this doesn't work, it's something you're doing. It's your fault"".  It didn't work.  The first night, I laid there feeling relaxed and kind of rubbery but not sleeping.  It wore off after a few hours, and I took another. Finally fell asleep around 330.  Still couldn't get up until 12.  The second night I took the last one around 1 am, I hallucinated for an hour before falling asleep.  Nothing over the counter comes even close to working.

I've been trying all semester to pull it together but I realized a few weeks ago I just can't do it.  I'm so worn out mentally and physically.  I can't enjoy anything anymore.  My eating habits are fucked.  I don't want to socialize, my friends will ask to hang out and I'll tell them I have to study.  That's true, but sometimes I just find myself in my room doing something else because I can't focus. I'm halfway through the semester and it's time to schedule my classes for next semester. My last semester.  I've been putting off scheduling an advising appointment because I didn't want to go before I had everything patched up.  I truly thought I could do it.  Then today my advisor sent me a personal email that she noticed I hadn't scheduled an appointment, and asked if everything is okay.  It's not.

I used to be so motivated.   I was the one who had his shit together. I go to a great college. My grades were good. I was taking college classes before I graduated high school. My family is so proud of me.  My dad told me I'll be the first doctor in the family.  My older brother didn't go to college and is a recovering drug addict.  He's doing really well now, he has a great job and has been clean for a few years.  But I feel a lot of pressure, even though I've never been told by anyone, to be ""the successful one"".

How do I ask for help? I know where the help is.  I don't know how to stop pretending like I'm okay.  My friends and family have always thought of me as having it together and being happy and motivated.  I don't know how to tell them I'm not.",1445541660.0

After three years without contact, I thought I would be ready to meet my ex again. I wasn't, I still love him, and now I feel like shit. 

***

I [25/M] loved my ex [27/M] very much. We met in college, we could talk for hours about topics that interested both of us, we shared a passion for travel and we laughed a lot. And last but not least: physically we were very attracted to each other. 

After about a year and a half, I got a major existential crisis. This sounds a lot darker than it was, but I couldn't find out what made life worth living. These thoughts had been looming in the background since I was 18 years old. I was 21 at the time and it was impossible to stop them. I started doubting everyting: my studies, my friends, my relationship, my hobbies, my whole existence. I got depressed and very stressed, and I used my regular coping mechanism: I shut everyone out. I couldn't talk about it with anyone, not even with him. It was, of course, disastrous for our relationship. After about two years, we broke up.

In retrospect, I consider all this my 'growing pains' into adulthood. The end of our relationship was a huge shock for me. I had never loved anyone so much and I didn't realise how much I fucked up until the moment the relationship ended. It was a catalyst for mending the bonds with my friends and family, and pursuing what I wanted in life. It worked. My friends and family are my focus in life, I'd give everything for them. And I got a job as a journalist, which I've always dreamed of. A year ago, I even bought an apartment.

Not long after our breakup, my ex moved to another European country for work. Suddenly we were separated by a distance of more than 1000 kilometers (620 miles). It was painful, but also comforting in a way. I had to move on because there was no way to start seeing him again. We lost contact almost completely.

But last week - almost three years later - I was on holiday with a group of friends (all gay guys) and we were going to visit the city where he lives. I pondered for a long time whether or not it would be a good idea to let him know. In the end I decided to go for it. He was enthusiastic, so we arranged to meet up last weekend.

The subway ride to the area where he was waiting for us, felt like a rollercoaster ride. I was so stressed out, even more so because we were more than half an hour late (which wasn't my fault, but still). My friends teasing me about the situation the whole time also didn't help, even though it was funny. My mind was racing. What would it be like to see him again? Would it be awkward? Would we be able to talk for hours like before? Would I still be attracted to him? Would he be angry because I was late?

When I got off the escalator and saw him, he smiled, and my heart jumped. He was beautiful. He wasn't angry at all, he was very sweet. It was an intense moment. It was also a bit weird, because I was joined by a group of nine friends. They all introduced themselves, he had some slightly awkward conversations with them, and then I said goodbye to my friends. We walked away from them under his umbrella, because it was raining cats and dogs.

It was a very unusual and emotionally charged situation. After three years, walking together trough a stunningly beautiful city, almost hugging because we had to fit under the same umbrella. It was... really romantic.

We started talking about the obvious things: our jobs, the city and his life there, our families and friends. He took me to one of the most beautiful bars in the city in an old conservatory overlooking a park. We talked for three hours without a dull moment. We instantly had great intellectual conversations just like years ago, we talked about memories we're both fond of, and we we very open about our lives, to the point where we told each other things we've been struggling with that we couldn't even tell most of our friends. It all felt so familiar, as if we never lost touch. It became clear that I still had very strong feelings for him. I honestly didn't expect this beforehand. 

He also told me that he had a boyfriend and that they were living together. I was glad that he was honest with me, but it still shattered my heart, although I tried very hard not to show that to him. He was quick to add that things weren't that great between them, because he was developing feelings for another friend he met a while ago. 

It was getting late and I had told my friends that I'd meet them for dinner. He asked if he could join us, which was fine, because I knew they were very curious about him too. Almost all of the friends that were with me didn't know me three years ago, so they had never seen my ex before. So he made a reservation at one of his favourite places and I let my friends know where to meet us. Then we went for another walk and another drink in a bar close to the restaurant. It was great fun and I felt like we would never run out of stuff to talk about. After another hour we met my friends at the restaurant. It was a really nice place, the food was great and they all liked him a lot.

When we were walking back to the subway - he and I under the umbrella again, my friends following us a few meters behind - I already felt the goodbye slowly ripping up my heart. When we got there, we had to go in separate directions. I hugged him, my friends hugged him. I waited until all my friends were on the escalator to say goodbye for the last time. Then I followed them and we got in the train. One of my friends hugged me, we sat down, and I told them how overwhelmed I was. I had to fight to hold my tears back.

Later that night he sent me a text message. That he really enjoyed seeing me again and meeting my friends. I felt butterflies in my stomach, it was weird. I answered that it was great to see him again.

The next day, during the whole 10 hour car ride home, there wasn't a minute in which I didn't think about him. We exchanged some texts about how the trip went. The further we drove away from him, the sadder I got. We arrived home in the middle of the night and I was so tired that I fell asleep within ten minutes after arriving in my apartment.

Since this morning when I woke up, I feel like I've gone through through the breakup all over again. It's terrible. I feel overwhelmed by my feelings and I'm pretty sure that it was a bad idea to meet up with my ex. I can't deny that I still love him and I feel like shit.

The last 3 years I had been living with my mom because I couldn't keep a job good enough to allow me to live on my own. This past August though, I found a low-income rent assistance program and got a nice apartment for really cheap, and its been great. 

About 6 weeks ago I took up yoga and now do it religiously. I've done it almost every day since then. 

I quit facebook because it was a negative thing in my life, saw a nutritionist and I'm eating much more healthfully, started seeing a new therapist because I was in a rut with the guy I was seeing before, and have a daily meditation practice. 

I still have significant symptoms, but I'm proud of everything I'm doing for myself, and hopeful that things should get better. 

I just wanted to share with people everything that I've done to be as mentally healthy as possible. Any words of encouragement are appreciated!

822,How do you find a new reason for living after you discover that the only thing you desired is unachievable?,"I wanted to do something unique and creative. Produce something that would not have existed had I never lived. That was the sole driving force in my life. It was what kept me working through college and into a PhD program. But over the past four years, the truth has become undeniable: I am not smart or creative enough to finish my PhD. I am not smart or creative at all, in fact. I will never do anything that someone else couldn't have done. To have ever thought otherwise is supreme arrogance, I know. But it was the driving force in my life, and now that I can no longer avoid its impossibility, I just don't have anywhere to go.

I need to make myself employable and find a career that pays and isn't humiliating. That will take work and commitment. But I can't summon any will to pursue anything, because the thought haunts me: even if I found myself gainfully employed, then what? I understand that I can't expect to find any joy or fulfillment in my work, but if so then it must be a means to an end. But what end? What is there beyond just continuing my existence out of blind inertia? 

How do you move on from that knowledge?",1415210034.0
823,Anyone else just freaking LONELY sometimes despite their support network? I need help to get over it.,"Hey, 33F with a history of depression. I'm also a mental health professional, so I know ""all the tricks"" regarding self-care, medication, therapy, etc...But that doesn't mean I follow all of them perfectly, or am impervious to other people's wisdom!  

I'm never-married, don't want kids, and have a really fantastic support system. In fact, I'm pretty confident and likeable in general. But behind the scenes, so to speak, I'm just sort of lonely. As an ""outgoing introvert,"" I'm an odd mix of gregariousness vs thirst for solitude; I am selectively social. Though I've had a fairly steady history of relationships, I'm presently not in one, and my previous bout of depression somewhat reduced the amount of social invites I now receive.  

My work is stressful, which generates the desire for solitude/unwinding, but I just sort of want to be held and desired.  And yet I've outgrown casual sex, and I realize the best thing I can do for right now is focus on self-betterment.

824,8 years of university,"I've been in college for 8 years because of my depression. I failed several of my classes related to my major and that had been delaying my graduation every semester. I'm not a horrible student by any means. I've got a 2.8 GPA after it all, never dipped below a 2.5, and I have 160 credits under my belt. I took only one semester off in those 8 years which I haven't decided was stupid of me or not although my therapist and psychiatrist seemed to believe having structure was important. Unfortunately, just having 160 credits is rather meaningless in getting a degree when some of those credits are classes you have retaken or classes that didn't transfer when you switched schools.

Anyhow, I got really close to actually graduating. I got my cap and gown. I walked the stage. Then over winter break, I get my grades back, and I find out I failed one of my last three classes. So I have to retake it in the spring. Just this one class.

I've been going through all of the emotions. Lots of anger towards the professor, the university, and just school as a whole. It's not really rational anger, but I can't help but feel like it is personal. I tried talking to the professor to bargain but was shut down quickly. I talked to my advisor about my options, and he said taking the class was my only option. I tried to look at the upsides and had a brief moment of hope. The only thing I can think of is I can try to take the opportunity to brush up on my skills before applying to jobs in the spring/summer because honestly, I'm not sure if I had what it takes to join the workforce in my field. It might be a self-esteem thing, but I never felt like I was as good as my peers. There's also a bit of fear that maybe I'll fail again. The next professor is my advisor and supposedly easier, but I just didn't get this class from the git-go. I'm not confident a different professor will make the class any easier.

Needless to say, I've been pretty bummed out for the last few weeks. I was looking forward to applying to jobs and actually getting my life started, but my life is on hold yet again for another semester. Granted, near the end of the semester, it was looking like I might fail, but it was too late to do anything. I couldn't not graduate because the school prepares you for graduating from nearly the beginning of the semester, and I talked to my professor regularly because I was worried about failing. I walked the stage, but now I have to tell everyone that was there that I didn't actually graduate. That part really sucks. Especially in the case of my dad, who just gets enraged and will belittle me. He's always been on my case as far as school goes.

I'm not sure if it's been worth the struggle.",1390360183.0

826,Not being able to get over a break up has brought my life to a halt and made me emotionally unstable. I have issues and I need to fix them.,"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend 4.5 months ago after a 4 year long friendship (really close friends all throughout college) out of which 2.5 years were spent in a relationship. We were great friends but in someways we were a terrible couple. I hated the relationship and wanted to break up as early as I can remember. I always knew we needed to break up but I really enjoyed her company (never got along with any girlfriend so well) and thats why it got dragged for 2.5 years. I tried to ignore the negatives which were mostly with regards to our future plans, our priorities in life and how things were in bed. After we broke up, I felt like I lost a huge, huge part of my life.

Now, she has a new boyfriend (probably, I refuse to let myself find out for sure) and we barely talk. Maybe a 20-30 message long text message conversation once a month. I make sure I have 0 interaction with her outside this conversation (that is always initiated by her). I don’t visit her Facebook, or ask people about her or anything. I completely block her out (I wish this would work and be enough). I never show her my sadness in these conversations (everything is always great! and awesome!). She is always super friendly and says things like I am glad you are doing fine, its so nice to catch up with you, I am so happy for us because we are both so much more happy now. I doubt she is faking anything. 

This might sound terrible but I **hate** that she is happy. I always want her to regret breaking up with me (I really want to stop wanting this, but deep inside, I cannot control it). Sometimes, I feel like that is the only reason I post stuff on Facebook anymore. I just want her to see how awesome I am becoming and how awesome my life is and somehow regret breaking up with me. Although I am sure she doesn’t give two fucks about what I am doing - nothing more than what a friend would. 

I hate how I think. The worst part is that I realise that I am being completely unreasonable and crazy. I even know it when the thoughts are passing through my mind or when I am missing her. Its like a part of my brain is observing my brain think this way and realising how stupid it is. But, I just can’t stop my brain from thinking that way. I really really want to stop it. I want to forget her. I want to move on so bad. I really wish I could just do that and be normal and not be affected by her in any way.

Some other problems:

- My mood is extremely volatile. I switch drastically between sadness and happiness within a few hours. I usually wake up really sad, depressed, annoyed with everything in my life, feeling like a loser… It usually gets better over the day and by afternoon sometimes I am very happy and not caring about anything and then again at night I am back to the same old depressive state. The degree of change in happiness and sadness is really drastic in my opinion. Also, I am sad way more often than I am happy.

- I miss her all the time. I find it very hard not to think of her constantly. Every time I am happy and enjoying, my brain - just completely out of the blue - stops, and thinks “Oh you are happy now, THINK ABOUT YOUR EX!” and then my mood dampens. What the fuck is that about…

I really really want to STOP thinking of her and missing her. It was a terrible relationship and I hated it. Breaking up felt so, so right. But I cannot get over it. I will do anything to stop missing her and to be happier or at least more normal. I have tried to block her off completely from my life. Nothing works… Nothing ever works. My brain is extremely insistent.

I think the problem probably is that I have nothing else to think about. I am not really interested in going for girls again and having to deal with them - I need a break. My social life is not too good. I have many friends but I dont feel close to any except one - I dont really want to hang out with them any more than I do. I have gone on 3 holiday trips with friends and family in the past month. I just spend my holidays being the same. Although I dont show it to my friends explicitly.

And I cannot get myself to focus on work - although it would benefit me so much to do so. I really want to do it but I just cannot do it. I keep getting distracted by thoughts of her and lack all motivation to do so. I keep trying to start building my own business but the inertia is so high, I havent been able to get over it.

What I want to achieve:

- I want to stop thinking about her, I really want to stop thinking, dreaming, missing her. Dreams are the worst. Sometimes I have a good 2-3 days but after that, I just have an elaborate dream of us being together again. It kills me when I wake up. I just want to erase her out of my mind. I don’t care about the memories! Fuck them. She just needs to get the fuck out of my head.
- I want to be emotionally stable, I don’t want to have mood swings, I dont want new techniques to try out because nothing works! I don’t want to keep making new resolutions or writing down goals and reading them every morning or doing fucking NLP positive reinforcements to be happy. Nothing is working!!! I actually think I am getting worse despite doing all this. I just want to be fucking normal.
- I want to focus on building my business, I want to have the motivation and drive to be able to do so.

I am really going crazy thinking about her all the time. I want to be normal and just forget it but I don’t know how. I really want it to stop. I dont want to get back with her (if she is still who she was when we broke up).

Really frustrated and lost.",1388653237.0
827,How I am attempting to overcome my depression,"This actually began as a reply to /u/smileandnad's post but I realized that I was just rambling off topic just talking about my experience so I decided to expand on it and just make it a self post.

I know depression is a bit different for everyone so I don't want to take away from what anyone is experiencing, but for me it comes in waves which makes it seem almost never ending. I'll have times where I am feeling much better and it seems I'm about to reach the shore until I get stressed or something happens then I get dragged back. Then again, I am to struggling to find worth in anything, especially myself, which causes me to hate myself leaving me with no motivation to go out into the world.

Even though I have been dealing with self-diagnosed depression for a very long time, I am currently trying overcome being the most depressed I've truly ever been. This has been going on for the last few months and it was only getting worse, because I wasn't doing anything to try and help myself. I literally did nothing. I slept on average between 14-16 hours a day, only going to class and doing things when I absolutely had to which caused everything to only be worse.

After a while, I realized that I am **insane**. I am not meaning really insane, or at least I don't think so, I mean by Einstein's definition. I know it is such a cliche quote but there is a reason for it. It applies so well to so many problems, which admittedly we have. Anyway, he supposedly said that the definition of insanity is ""doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.""

Anyway, I came to the conclusion that I was insane. Each time I fell back into depression I did the same thing, just hoping that it would get better. I would dwell on all of my faults, how worthless I am, how I hate everything, how I have no passions, and I was so unhappy. I just go to sleep and hope it will be better, I will be better. But when I wake up, it isn't and I am not. And then, I would to think about times in my life where I was actually happy and I didn't understand it. I didn't really try to make myself happy, I just was so why couldn't I be now. So I thought it was almost something I would get just get over. And then recently, I realized that it was not going to happen. So I started to do something about it.

I know all of us have heard it before that you need to just get out of bed, find a hobby, or do something fun and you will be much happier. And honestly, there is nothing more I hate when people tell me that but it's true, even though it typically comes from someone who doesn't have much experience with depression or at least in my experience. Because they don't seem to know how difficult it is for us to just get out of bed and do something. There is always a reason not to do something when you are depressed, ""I don't deserve it,"" ""What's the point,"" ""I am too tired."" For me, it is such an exhausting task to get out of bed so it seemed impossible. But I realized I had to discontinue this pathetic existence, and actually learn to like myself. I had to force myself to do something about it no matter how exhausting and overwhelming it may be. 

I decided to think of it like I'm at the beach, floating on a raft in the ocean. I start to notice that I'm getting pulled out to sea but don't do anything about it. Eventually, I start to think about trying to swim back to shore, but then that involves swimming back while dragging the raft, which sounds exhausting and I am already tired as is. Plus the occasional wave out this far pushes me a little closer to shore giving me hope of hitting a huge wave and coasting in without doing anything. However, it is beginning to reach a point where it doesn't look like that wave is going to hit so I decide I have a couple options: swim to shore, wait and hope someone helps me, hold out for the big wave, or I guess, hope that I eventually hit land. So I'm deciding to swim but I may ditch the raft, I haven't decided about that yet.

And now, ""I am insane"" has become my mantra. I decided that I can't be insane anymore by just doing the same thing over and over again just waiting for something different to happen which never does. I have to stop hating myself and instead do something about it. So I am being proactive. I'm waking up at a regular time, limiting my sleep, trying different things so I can find something I am good at, for example: I picked up oil pastels and drew for a total of 15 hours in two days. It's easy to get lost in a drawing. Also, I am trying to build confidence by wearing nicer clothes, and practice things I like doing so eventually I will have a skill I am confident in. And I began reading books instead of mindlessly watching T.V. I have been trying to read books that are not only enjoyable but teaches me something, most recently, *Metamorphis* by Kafka. I highly reccommend it and is a very quick read, however, you will spend a lot of time thinking about it afterward. Also, I went to my first therapy appointment and discovered that I don't like the psychoanalyst approach... so I am actively looking for a new therapist and scheduled a psychiatrist appointment. I also started seeing a nutritionist because evidently I am severely malnourished for a 22 year old American male which I guess just adds to my exhaustion. So now, I am finally beginning to feel different and much better than I have for awhile.

I know I didn't say anything new, and a lot of this is redundant, and quite possibly unnecessary, but I just hope maybe that my experience can help at least one person start to feel better. And I know right now could just be a good couple weeks but at least I'm actually in the water trying to swim, making something happen, instead of waiting on the raft, just hoping that it does.

TL;DR: I finally got out of bed and now I feel much better.",1383766799.0
828,Had a major meltdown yesterday - still did a good job interview today.,"Seriously, yesterday I was a total mess from waking up at 7am, walked to my mates house at 9am in a panic and started having suicidal thoughts for the first time ever. They were fucking terrifying. My friend phoned my best mate who's a psychistrist for advice, then stayed with me until my other friend came round for dinner - which he brought with him, cooked at mine, and then stayed with me til bedtime. And I made it. They were all there for me. The bad thoughts started receding, we watched comedy, I did some interview practice with them, and made sure everything was sorted for the morning.

And today I got up, followed my plan to make sure I got up, showered, dressed and fed before the interview, and I held it together all morning and did a good job at the interview this afternoon. Did not have any suicidal thoughts today, in fact very few negative thoughts at all. I got through it.

And well, then I got home and rolled a nice spliff! I feel much better now the interview's done. Yesterday was very frightening, and it was very scary for my friends as well to actually hear me talking about ending it. But they were all there. And as one of them said, the important thing and the impressive thing is that I'm prepared to ask for help. And it's taken a huge amount of strength to go through the whole application and interview process and to do it well, but I've done it. And it took a huge amount of strength to get through yesterday right when I was feeling at my very weakest, and to be ready for that interview today, and I did it.

829,I just realized that changing 'you' to 'I/me' in self-critical thoughts may help to defuse them,"Wanted to suggest this in case it helps anyone in the future.

I was journaling and I wrote out:  

>I hate me because I need people. Why can't you learn to stop needing them?  

I stopped and wondered why I had changed tense. I tried changing 'you' to 'I' and it felt uncomfortable, but I realized that it also made me acknowledge what I was doing so that the thought wasn't so automatic. It surprised me and my anger/despair/etc. ebbed a bit as I was forced to acknowledge that all I was doing was self-hating.

Using 'you' in my own thoughts made it seem victimless. I'm the one speaking and there's no one else around to be hurt so I must not be hurting anybody. It's silly but ingrained, and this little trick I found may help in the future, if I can remember to use it.",1366017877.0
830,One easy thing that's making me feel better every day,"Every night before I go to bed, I write down anything good I can remember about the day. That's it.

Most of mine are little things like ""Listened to Professor Blastoff while doing the dishes"" or ""Got some work done"" or ""Played with [dude that's a cat]"" or ""It rained"". 

I'm naturally very anxious and pessimistic and trying to ""stay positive"" feels really stupid sometimes. For whatever reason, this doesn't feel stupid. It's actually kind of fun and I look forward to doing it. I've tried doing it at other times of the day, but it really only seems to work if I do it before bed. Maybe it's subconsciously reframing my outlook in a positive way and relieving my anxiety about confronting the past. Whatever's going on, I feel less shitty now.

I've reached the point where being non-depressed is a positive feedback system and not something I have to fight every day...usually. I'm moving out of the 'burbs and into a vibrant city (Denver) and need to get a job there.

**The problem:** What with me being depressed through all of my work history, it's pretty shitty. I have been financially dependent on my discouraging father for large portions of my life since high school (obviously a big source of my depression). I have a BA in something I don't want to do, and had horrible grades and took 9 years to finish college. My work history is a string of mediocre jobs with bosses I hated, so I'm not going to be able to get any good references there. I've spent the last 2 years working for myself at home/mooching off my father.

834,I'm finally pulling myself out of my depression.,"For the last three years, I've been severely, chronically ill. Due to my inability to work or do much, my boyfriend was supporting me, and it's been draining us financially and emotionally. Over time, we've both become depressed from the unending strain.

A couple weeks ago, we reached a breaking point with our stress -- more ridiculous shit happened, and out of desperation and helplessness, I reached out to my family and asked for help. To my great surprise, it was met with apathy, or in some cases, concern but unwillingness to help.

After a few days of dealing with that... somehow, that empowered me. My boyfriend and I had many long talks and decided if others were unwilling to help us, we'd do it ourselves.

We had already been putting some things in place to help with my health and our money, but we redoubled our efforts and started working on a lot of different things.

835,I feel like I am a boy trapped in a man's body.,"I'm letting out some thoughts that have either been intentionally hidden by my psyche, that I've neglected to think about because of a combination of lack of time and lack of discipline.  There may be some rambling because of this, but I'll try to keep it concise.

I was the product of interracial parents.  While there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, the culture gap between my parents, combined with my unique circumstances, shaped me into an odd human being.  My dad was the lazy hippie type- not a disciplinarian, and was never much motivated to accomplish things.  He never taught me the crucial things that I now feel a father should instill in his son- teaching him to have a positive outlook on life, learning to love the satisfaction you get from hard work, how to talk to people in a way that they respect you, etc.  He is very much a good-hearted man, and I love him, but I feel the way he raised me led me on a path.  My mother was the one burdened with keeping me in line.  She did the best she could, but she comes from a culture that uses shame as a behavior deterrent.  I quickly learned not to behave a certain way because I wanted to avoid the shame associated with bad behavior.  Rarely if ever did I hear a kind word from my mom when growing up.  I was always being reprimanded.  I don't blame my mom or dad- they did the best they could with me considering how their life experiences shaped them.  I have no ill feelings toward them, in fact they are part of my inspiration to turn my life around.  

I never had nice clothes growing up- I had awkward thrift store clothes during the time when adolescents are the most self-conscious.  I got made fun of, people ostracized me and called me names with no provocation.  I started to think that some innate part of my character or looks was causing it, and that it was justified.  I was miserable and didn't even feel ""good enough"" to talk to people- I didn't want to risk evoking scorn from them.  I had a very hard time- and became very avoidant of anything resembling a social situation.  I eventually dropped out of high school much to my parents' dismay and secluded myself from the world.  I became a bitter person with nothing to aspire to, no skills, no anything, just a waste of space and potential.  It's hard to imagine how being a shut-in cripples you unless you've experienced it- it's like the ultimate deprivation.  

Fast forward over a decade.  I have worked on myself, clawed through deep depression, been shaped by new life experiences, done difficult things and succeeded at them.  I've sacrificed and worked harder than most college students to put myself in graduate school now.  I'm working damn hard to start a career even though I don't have much work experience.  I've embraced meditation and yoga- life is so much better when my I respect my body.  I have a positive outlook on life now.  I feel grateful that I get to experience life- even the hard times.  I want the world to be a little better place because of the short time I spent in it.       

That said, I still have problems stemming from my upbringing and being a shut-in.  It's very hard for me to socialize or make friends.  Most people can see that I'm a good person and like my energy, but I'm just not experienced in socializing.  It's something I need to work on- for years I felt like I wasn't even worthy of initiating an interaction with other people.  I find it hard to talk unless what I say passes a certain ""quality threshold"", which I know is silly.  I just want to be at ease and be able to act naturally.  

I am going on a journey, looking inside myself, seeing if I can make something of myself and be happy doing it.",1321419806.0

837,How to cope with a job I despise?,"I really want to go to college. Its a goal of mine, one I care about deeply, because I want to find a work environment I can be happy in, or at least not miserable. 

To make that happen, I'm working in an aircraft factory. Problem is, its only been 7 months and I already want to quit more and more every time I put on my hard hat and boots. 

I hate the work I do, and I'm not even sure I truly need it to make my goal a reality.

It's grating on me. I truly feel like I have no energy for most of my week. 

The real kicker? I haven't even started College. I just don't know what to do.

This job feels like the only secure option, but I really don't know if it will be possible with my mental health. I just got out of the Suicidal Depression I've been in since 9, and I really don't want to go back. 

I've considered living with my parents, or maybe even my friends parents, but my Mother's situation is not friendly to that, and my Father wants us to be independent. My friend's mom might let me stay there, but 4 years with bare minimum rent is a long time, and a big burden to ask someone to take on for a selfish goal I could probably achieve by just working hard.

I do everything I need:I have a job, food, stable housing and some amount of free time every week.Ive tried starting hobbies, but they always fall to the wayside because I feel I have no time, or its a waste of time. Sometimes things are enjoyable, but mostly I feel like I don't care and will never fulfill my goals.

Wtf is my problem? I have free time to do things but I have an extreme apathy at times. I want to be fulfilled, and I try but its just not enough. I seem to expect more from myself but never really want to fall for that delusion.

I hate to admit it, but I have self harmed if the apathy, self hatred and depressive episodes get bad enough, nothing serious but still concerning. Ive tried a few meds, but generally dislike them, and therapy just feels like I cant make much progress with. Is this my pathetic limit? is this all life is?

839,I can see the light at the end of the tunnel - but I keep falling into regret.,"I'm in my early 30's and I honestly do not know how I made it this far being so unhappy. But I somehow held on, and just barely established a career, maintained a great friend group and maintained a fitness/diet routine.

However, it has only been in the last 3 months that I have been able to pull myself out of depression. It didn't come all at once, and some days are still bad, but I am trending upwards for sure - and I can see myself living a somewhat normal life at some point.

**How I was able to do this briefly, is that I finally convinced myself to believe in myself. I am convinced I can fix myself, I can overcome challenges, and I will find a way to live the life I want.** That is it - and I cannot tell you how to get there, but for me it was years of trial and error.

But, the challenge I am facing is: now that I am coming out of this darkness, I see the world entirely different, and I regret that I lived my teens and 20's in this shadow. I think, how much better those years could've been and how much different my life could be now.

I tell myself, this happened for a reason and that the past doesn't matter because I can build the future I want, but still it seems like many years were wasted being depressed, and that makes me feel like I'm behind even if I do end up succeeding.",1675367940.0

841,Stuck on 'the glory days',"I'm a 22 AMAB with a history of poor mental health in my teens. My struggle with depression arguably reached its worst when I was 18 where several bad events happened consecutively and ended up with me losing almost my entire circle of friends. However, after reaching what I thought was 'rock bottom', I started changing my habits: I lost weight healthily (after having a history of disordered eating), joined clubs and found new interests and genuinely started feeling good about myself for the first time in, well... ever.  


Cut to 2020 when the pandemic hit, things were going alright for me at the start - I seemed to be handling everything well for the most part and even managed to make a new circle of friends online. But when college started that year, I essentially ""broke"". Let me first preface that alongside my struggles with depression I have also had to deal with anxiety disorders and OCD. It seemed that whatever subconscious stress had been building up within me just exploded and all of a sudden I couldn't take life anymore. It got so bad I had to drop out and take a gap year to try and fix my problems.  


Since then, I have fallen back into the cycle of depression, but with the added bonus (/s) of constantly reminiscing and reminding myself that I used to be 'better' and 'fixed', which is making me feel even worse and harder to get help or manage it. I guess the main point of this rant is I just want some reassurance that it isn't just me and I can get over this.",1669247162.0
842,"I can’t stop obsessing over having been unfairly targeted by a group of cruel people. I want to just pursue my hobbies, education and fitness but I can’t because of this. How do I move past it?","
I have never really had any friends in real life and I’ve always struggled with social anxiety as well as low confidence because I grew up in an abusive home. The few friends I did have usually mistreated me in some way for being unpopular or we just naturally drifted. 

This led me to being an outcast and finding very toxic, misogynistic online spaces where I naively believed people would be understanding because they were spaces for other outcasts. I stuck around because I found the memes funny, it was interesting, I didn’t know that guys struggled with loneliness and insecurities about appearance like I did.

Getting to the point, I found one interactive space linked to such communities where there was a group of people who were nice to me at first, called me funny and smart for the first few months. I ended up talking to a guy and we got into a toxic friendship thing because I’d call him up on sexualising underage girls and he’d tell me it’s a joke and that I don’t understand humour but then he’d keep making the same posts and they were serious. Sometimes he’d admit that he preferred underage girls, then when I’d say he liked them he’d say I’m accusing him of committing a crime and would say he doesn’t like me viewing him in a bad light. (He ended up dating an underage girl a year later too, when he would tell me that he’d never date an underage girl.) He would also encourage me to act overly attached to him, for ex I made accounts to contact him when he’d block me during arguments (which  I know is wrong, I regret it and will never do something like that again) and I’d beg for him not to cut contact with me and then the next day I’d ask if he wants me to stop being so clingy, if he finds me creepy and he’d say no, he liked what I did and found it sweet and that it showed I genuinely did like him. This happened multiple times. We then stopped talking and he told the group everything that had happened but instead spun it into me being obsessive and him having never liked me (even though we spoke regularly, he told me he spoke to other girls but I was the only close female friend he had, he tried to meet with me many times and I’d be the one putting it off, he’s the one who introduced the idea of us having sex, he told me he wanted to meet even if I didn’t want to have sex), I was sexually obsessed with him and he rejected it (he’s the one who’d initiate all conversations about sex), he showed them all screenshots of the accounts I made. He told them details about my personal life and trauma and laughed about It to them too. He also reached out to me months later, apologised for everything and said he wanted to be friends but he’d continue to lie to me when I’d ask if he’d been talking about me (he had) negatively and why he does or says certain things, so he just called me crazy for noticing his lies. 

The group bullied me, they’d all constantly be talking about me in voice recordings and group chats (other people told me about this), they’d spam pictures of me, they kept calling me insane when I’d respond (I would just keep repeating the same argument that they didn’t know anything about me and were targeting me for no reason), they would even start talking about me to new members who joined the group and those people would hate me and start attacking me too. They’d also claim that I take things too seriously and that it’s a joke but they were needlessly and relentlessly bullying me when I hadn’t done anything to them. I can see the difference between a joke and evil behaviour. They also would save and post girl’s nudes, post people’s pictures without permission, obsess over underage girls (they’d done this from the start, yet they’d say they only did it as a joke because I would call them out on it and they wanted to annoy me, when in reality these men genuinely did find underage girls attractive and had been saying so before I’d ever even spoke out against it), dox people, they’d target other members of the group too but not as severely as they did to me. They would call me paranoid because I’d tell them to stop talking about me (they’d claim they weren’t even though other people showed me evidence they were.) They’d call me obsessive, yes I was obsessed with the guy but I was not obsessed with any of them as individuals, I’d only interact with them if they started on me for no reason. 

I know that these people are just losers but it still gets to me that they’d believe the lies from that guy and that they’d call me insane when they’d do a lot worse things than me and all I did was get upset and defend myself when I was being attacked. I never did any of the weird things they did, I simply tried to use logical arguments against them. There are even people who weren’t directly in the group who had originally liked me who started insinuating I was some crazy, ugly freak when again I hadn’t done anything. Not everyone thought this way though, I did have a handful of people tell me that they targeted me for no reason and I wasn’t the problem and they were weirdos. I also went to a few other communities where people had interacted with these same people and they called them insufferable too. I’d only stay in the community and keep going back because I wanted to defend myself and I thought eventually they’d see how weird they were being, and because originally I just liked posting my own content there because I was viewed as funny.

It just makes me cringe that I even care about this stuff and I want my brain to turn it off but I can’t. I just keep going over it all in my head, thinking about specific arguments and how I wasn’t even wrong at all (there was even one occasion where a girl had targeted me for giving her advice and then months later said that I was right) and there was nothing I could’ve said differently, how it’s unfair and weird that I was treated insane when I just hadn’t done much and there were other girls in that same community who were extremely malicious and cruel for no reason. I also hate that the guy lied about me and would act like I was the problem. He also spread lies about me, saying I’m a derogatory term for promiscuous women and I just want to be used by a random guy for sex (I’m an adult virgin), that My family are poor (my dad makes over 120k a year), I’m from a different county that I claim to be because he’d met one other girl from the same county who had a different accent? All the people there were extremely deranged yet they viewed themselves as normal and called me deranged it was weird

I’ve had bouts of being ill for 2-3 months, seeing doctors and specialists only to not figure out the cause of my illness and end up having to work from home through my illness after running out of sick leave.

848,How I got over it.,"I followed Buddhism until the practice it describes became so clear, simple, and effective to me that I stopped needing to call it Buddhism or anything at all. Buddhism was my entry point to this practice. Somehow its presentation resonated with me. I believe that many others find the practice in different ways. Some discover it on their own. Some are taught. The Buddha himself said there are 84,000 ways of discovering it. They all point to the same practice which ultimately connects you with the inner strength which helps to heal and be happy. If you are struggling I sincerely hope you find the path and get over it! Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to.  


Edit: Someone asked for elaboration so here goes, but this will all be personal to me and many will disagree:

Buddha's teaching was that the cure for personal mental suffering is a practice of morality & mindfulness which leads to wisdom and happiness over time. My own finding after years of practice and seeing it work is that my ego has become smaller and less dense and my awareness has become stronger and more clear. As I said, these kinds of terms have very personal meanings and are likely to create confusion and debate. The practice itself is simple: You just 1. stop doing bad things and 2. meditate.",1638890626.0

852,"The lie of ""It gets better"" and ""my"" truth I learned the hard way.","
I want to share a quick story around the lie of ""it gets better."" 
Before jumping to conclusions, please, hear me out and read the whole story.

How many of you have heard that from someone on your journey? 
If you haven't, congrats; you're in the minority.


My belief (and maybe you also share it) is that unless you've walked this road, you truly don't know what it's like. 
You don't know the toll it has on you.

My journey along this road began at age five and would last thirty years. 

Throughout the years, people would say to me, ""it gets better."" 
I never believed them. 
Why would I? 
I had no reason to believe them. 
I had never known anything in my life except for living a suffering life, just struggling to get to the next day.

How could I ever believe it when I spent every day swimming around in the same garbage that I had always known?

There was no way for me ever to believe ""it gets better"" because I hadn't experienced it, ever.

Fast forward to days after a swat team busted through my apartment door (the wrong apartment door, oops...).

My anxiety, depression, and PTSD were at a lifetime high. I was crumbling inside and out. Life was constantly doing to me what it had always done. Always getting screwed over, hurt, discarded. 

That incident is one of the things I am most grateful for because, at the height of my struggles, there was a spark deep within me that finally started to shine through.

 That spark was the realization that:

- I had spent over twenty years waiting for change to come. 
- I had spent over two decades of my life waiting for things to get better. 
- I wasted over two decades of my life that I will never get back waiting for ""it will get better."" 

Here's the lie: It doesn't get better.

Here's my truth: It doesn't get better unless you take action and fight for change. 

If you keep doing what you've always done, you will keep getting what you always got.
You will wait your entire life waiting for change that will never come. 

I had enough of waiting for things to ""get better."" 
I was done waiting.
Since change wasn't coming to me willingly, It was time I take control and force it to come kicking and screaming.

Through taking unwavering action, I was able to start getting different results and start seeing change. 

There was a ton of trial and error, but I found what worked for me to get me out of the shitshow that was my life.

I lived my entire life believing I was broken, lost with no hope, never believing anything else was possible because nothing ever worked for me. 

While all that same time, I was being fed the lie that others who had no idea what I was going through were feeding me.

I realize now that it's not entirely their fault that they don't know ""It gets better"" is a lie. You don't know what you don't know. 
You can't know what you don't experience.

There's an ancient Chinese proverb that I live my life by that says, ""To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."" 

While your situation is different than mine, you and I share the same road. The only difference is you're currently walking that journey, and I'm walking on the way back. 

But unlike others who throw out the lie. 
I'm walking back on the very same road to help you along your journey and supporting you every step of the way on the road ahead so that you, too, will get to the point where you are on the road back with me supporting others along their journeys.

It gets better when you take unwavering action and do the work, whatever it takes. 

I want to leave with three of the hardest lessons that took me to learn before taking that first step forward.

It's not your fault.
You're not to blame.
But it is your responsibility to transform.

Let me know your thoughts in the comments below. 
I appreciate all feedback.

To the journey,
Much love to you all.",1616784898.0
853,"When you're being criticized, notice when defensiveness starts boiling up - you may be missing a chance to grow","How do you feel when someone criticizes you? Maybe it prompts you to start beating yourself up. Nobody likes to be criticized, especially if you have perfectionist tendencies. 

Its important to think about the source of the criticism - it makes a huge difference whether it comes from a friend that we know cares about us or someone that might have other motivations. Whether the criticism is delivered with kindness or rudeness, listen to what they have to say. Don’t react immediately, breathe.  if you’re feeling defensive just notice and acknowledge that feeling. Its really important to take your time, so you might want to acknowledge to the person that you’ve heard what they’ve said and walk away. Take some time to let your mind settle before you tackle what’s going on.

The golden rule is to treat yourself with kindness, even if you think you’ve made a mistake. Non-judgement is key - you don’t have to take a view of yourself or the critical person; accept that they’re feeling the way they are and that you’re feeling the way you are without judging.

So now you’ve stepped away and now you’re giving some consideration to what the person has said. Ask yourself the key question - is it true? What good can I take from what I heard? And that’s up to you - if there’s genuinely nothing of value to take that's fine but there’s usually something for us to learn even if its not what the person was trying to communicate.

The last thing to bear in mind is that there’s a difference between criticism and abuse. If you are being regularly unfairly criticised in a destructive way you should know that this is not OK. If they attack you, you don’t have to justify who you are, you don’t have to explain, you don’t have to defend.But most of all you don’t have to argue. If they don’t listen, protect yourself by stepping back from the relationship - nothing is more important than your peace and your mental health.

854,"Anxiety about my partner following social media ""models""","Let me start out by saying I'm looking for feedback on maybe myself more than anything.

I've never had a problem with my partner using porn, hell I use it myself. I don't have a problem with social media either, although I don't really use it myself except for reddit.

But social media has morphed into softcore porn - Insta and tiktok ""models"" whose accounts exist only to serve as wank material.

Where I personally draw the line between what I am and am not comfortable with regarding porn usage is intimacy.

Porn on pornhub is impersonal. You can't contact the actors, there's no reciprocation or interaction. It's just something to wank to and then move on.

Social media on the other hand is not impersonal. Those are REAL people and if you follow them, you will see them and be aroused and feel connected to them every day.

To me, that is a sexual relationship, even if it's just in your mind, because that's someone who is on your mind frequently possibly every day that you are lusting over and bonding with emotionally.

For me personally, that crosses a boundary. It doesn't make me feel respected to know my partner is actively pursuing other women to crush on.

It doesn't make me feel honored.

What is honor to me? To nurture your sexual connection with your partner (not nurture a sexual connection with a model you're crushing on).

But the thing is, I don't want to control my partner. I don't want to tell him what to do. I set my boundary and then if he doesn't agree that's fair and we go our separate ways..

But what happened was, I set my boundary, and an effort was made on his own to remove some of the models he follows, but there are still plenty of them left. And one of his main downtime activities is scrolling through social media, so the amount of time he's dedicating to them isn't something I'm comfortable with.

I don't want to be one of many intimate relationships in my partner's head.. I don't want to feel like an option... Especially when I look at the other options he chooses which I in no way compare to...

So after all that, I'm definitely open to advice and differing opinions, because I'm miserable.. Every few weeks I get anxiety to the point where it can completely wreck my mood sometimes for a couple days..

What do you think? Any suggestions on how I can get over it?

If you made it this far, thank you for reading!",1612651450.0
855,I don't like this trend,"This is the first time I've posted anywhere about something like this, let me know if there's a better sub for it or anything like that. 

I've never thought of myself as someone who might have mental health issues, and to be honest I don't think I am right now. I don't think its too foreign to me though, I've spent a lot of time trying to be there for my friends suffering from these kinds of things. But while I think I can identify some of the signs in other people, I'm not so sure about me.

I feel like I could be on a downward slope. I feel less motivated in general and have trouble focusing. I'm ore anxious than normal. I say in my head I hate myself when I'm failing at something.

857,How to deal with someone being cold to you and nice to everyone else?,"I (25) have a sister (22) who I have had an estranged relationship with for over 5 years. She initiated the estrangement by just completely ignoring me one day. I went crazy at first, tried desperately to find out why she was treating me like this. I kept initiating contact, and gradually found out that she just simply hated my personality.

I felt really bad and tried so hard to work on the qualities she said that she hated, hoping that she will like me after I improve, but I think she just hates my guts and no amount of self-improvement I make will change her mind. My family has been of no help. They always excuse her as just being young, tell me I'm too sensitive, and don't understand any of the emotional pain because she is perfectly pleasant to them. And my sister goes out in the world and is super nice and smiling to her friends, coworkers, etc. It just kills me that I can't get an ounce of her kindness, when I'm her only sibling and spent a childhood together. It makes me so angry that everyone else in the world probably thinks she's a wonderful person when she has been a strong contributing factor to my depression.

I still live in the same house as her, and can't afford to get my own place. It's been 5 years since the estrangement and I still ruminate about her every day. What disturbs me is the extremely dismissive way she continues to treat me. We rarely talk, but on the cases I have to, she speaks to me so coldly. It might sound like nothing, but it truly makes me feel utterly worthless being treated like this for many years, while seeing her act the complete opposite to everyone else. I really don't know what I did to deserve this treatment and I don't know how to stop ruminating about her. I know she's not thinking about me, and the intrusive thoughts about her is a big reason for my depression.

858,First time doing cold exposure with the Wim Hoff method.,"I've been using the breathing technique of the Wim Hoff method as a kind of warm-up for my daily meditations. I hate the cold and had no intention of doing the cold exposure portion of the Wim Hoff method.

""I did 5 seconds of cold exposure.""

then I took out some more.

""I did cold exposure.""

Then I spent a couple of minutes practically yelling positive affirmations at my Self in the mirror.

""You did it""

""So what if it was only five seconds, that's 5 more seconds than you had ever planned to do""

""Take the win.""

859,The loneliness is really getting to me [RANT],"So as I said in my last post, uni and pandemic are a really shit mix when I feel how I feel but especially this past week. Im used to being by myself and normally it wont pose an issue but recently I've been craving some real connection with someone. Christ, its really hard to put into words how I feel right now but I'm sure someone on here will get what I mean.
I've been struggling a lot with trying to open up to people about whats really going on in my head because I've been good with concealing how my heads ticking over for most of my life and I've thought this would be a good thing; sort of like being a cool headed card player but clearly its only good to a certain extent. Nowadays, its become more paralysing to my emotions than anything. I can't work out my emotions/thoughts into words, even now this has taken me the guts of an hour to type out because I dont know. I've thought about returning home and resuming online lectures there but to be frank, I'm not sure being home would make any difference. I feel trapped",1601912797.0

863,How do I re-join the world?,"Im pretty sure Ive always been depressed. I dont really remember being happy consistently. Then again, I dont really remember anything about my childhood or high school years (even college years) aside from a few snipits or major memories.

Im a 28 year old failure and ive brought all of it on myself. I dont really think there was any abuse or trauma or anything I can b;lame it on. Ive always been aware of what ive been doing to myself, I just always find a way to make an excuse. I still live at home and at the moment Ive pretty much went full hermit. Its getting to the point where im ashamed to leave my room. I dont even want to face my parents. I just dont want to do anything. I was relieved when covid hit, my self isolation could be semi validated. In reality It was like that months before the virus. At the moment I haven't left my room in months, aside from necessities like food and bathroom, even hygiene has been slipping. Its going to start affecting my health.

Ive never really wanted to do anything. Ive been kinda under the mindset of keep just doing stuff and eventually you will find something you like, find a purpose. Ive thoroughly enjoyed sports/ skating/ snowboarding, but for the past 9 months or so I haven't done a damn thing. I have a useless bachelors degree I got because that was what you were supposed to do. Ive worked several jobs. I made a big step about 3(?) years ago when I realized my drinking was becoming kinda dangerous. I stopped smoking and drinking completely, saved up and bought a car. I even got a decent job that was paying relatively well. I lost a lot of weight and ran every other day. I completed a decently timed half marathon. On paper it was going great, however I dont think I was actually happy. It felt like I was forcing myself to do all of this. 

&#x200B;

Eventually the job started getting worse. I was working 70 hour weeks at a customer facing job that was pretty stressful. I wasn't the first to leave, in fact I was one of the last. People kept leaving the job and instead of hiring more people, they would load all their work onto us. No incentive or raise either. They would lower our resources as well and it got stressful. So I quit. That was in September. I figured I would take a break for a couple weeks and relax then tryhard at something different. That week turned into a month, then that month just started cycling. Then covid hit and Ive been using it as a convenient excuse to not do anything.

I saw a therapist twice I think, but just kinda stopped. I really dont know if it was helping. I hate talking about it, to anyone. It makes me uncomfortable. Ive been taking the medicine. It might be helping a bit, idk never really noticed much. Its been 4 months since I started taking it. I do think about dying less I guess. That was never really a valid option for me though, I would just fantasize. At this point Im just ashamed. I hate myself for being so weak.

It's good that I gained perspective but I went to the point that I see no value in anything that I was or am interested in. I used to be avid sketcher drawing concepts and all, writer writing a couple short stories and conceiving vast worlds in my head (which I've once fused with my sketching into a comic writer), I was interested in music composing and singing that I studied music theory and etc. Then I just stopped because what is there for me with those talents? I'm not great in any of them, I'm still far from great with m y art and require tons of practice, I never wrote a full length story, and heck I barely wrote a song and couldn't even play a single barre chord.

867,I still doubt if I have depression.,"I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety several times, the very first time being when I was 8 years old. But why do I still sometimes think I might not have it? Like, I think ""Well maybe this is normal, maybe I just have to tough it out"" and I end up feeling worse, feeling like nothing can help me. For a very long time I denied I was depressed because I didn't want to kill myself. I read about depression and the symptoms and thought ""I don't feel like that all the time, so I guess I don't have it"".

But the past month has been hard. A depressive episode was triggered because of a show I watched. I became obsessed with all the negative aspects of the show and it was the only thing I thought of. I was spiraling, I felt no joy from anything and being around the people I loved was painful. At times I would stare at the wall and just cry because I felt so hopeless. I lost 7 pounds in three days and just wanted to sleep all day. I felt like I was going fucking crazy. ""Is this normal? Am I normal? Is it supposed to be like this? What do I do? How do I fix it?"" It was hell. This lasted about a week, and you know what? After it was over I did some searching and saw that a depressive episode lasts at least two weeks. I thought ""Oh, I guess I wasn't depressed then, I guess I just overreacted. Maybe it's normal to be like this."" 

Ever since then I've felt this lingering feeling. Sometimes it rears it's head, I get overwhelmed and I start crying, feel hopeless again, but it passes after a day usually. But its really hard to keep interested in anything, even the things I love to do I just... I will try and do them but get tired of it after a bit. It's almost like everything is just too boring.

I tried an add-on (Abilify) to my Lexapro (30mg) but it just made me confused and dazed, it even made my vision worse. So now I'm at the highest dose of Lexapro (40mg) and I still feel the same. I feel stuck, I don't know what to do. I thought I was doing so good, but now I'm scared. I don't want to experience that feeling again, that empty hollow version of myself...

Any insight, really. 

&nbsp;

I listen to music all the time. I'll find a song I like and listen to it on repeat for hours at a time. When I get into my car I take out my headphones and plug into the car speakers. When I get out of my car I put on headphones. When I'm not at work, headphones. I am rarely doing something without music. If I don't have music on, I have YouTube on. I can't think of the last time I cooked, cleaned, or even took a walk without headphones. Music is basically just another vehicle for maladaptive daydreaming (which I do know the name of) to me. I listen to mostly very sad or very fast/angry songs. I slip into daydreaming too easily, and it's how I fall asleep at night. I spin stories inside my head on a daily basis, especially when work gets hard or complicated. 

&nbsp;

I also have disordered eating behaviors. I've never purged with exercise, literally purging, or otherwise. But as long as I can remember I've used food and eating too much as a way to get ""high."" I used to think I was numbing myself, but I know that all those processed foods release a lot of chemicals in the brain. So I've come around to the idea that it's more about a high, even if afterward I feel bloated and disgusting and regretful. In the moment it feels great. 

&nbsp;

I feel as though I can't enjoy things like normal people. Memes, food, music, anything. If I like something I *really* like it and go absolutely overboard with it. But I don't know if ""like"" is the correct word, because if you asked me what I like or enjoy, I can't think of anything. I told my therapist that I feel like I *use* things. I use food, I use music, but I don't know if I *like* or *enjoy* any of it. She didn't really understand or get the distinction and it started a whole conversation about how food could be art, and beautiful, and something that bonds us, etc. I told her that I would love it if we just all drank those Soylent smoothies (the real ones, not the ones from the movies) because then I wouldn't have to agonize over the choices anymore.

But I'm single, I have Major Depressive Disorder and maybe Bipolar Disorder, I don't know at this point. I'm always angry and miserable. I'm pretty sure my mom is either Bipolar or has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and it's really hard on me.

There are times where I think my mom hates me and my dad sides with her because it's easier. I'm withdrawing from the friends that I do have and this guy that I'm seeing doesn't love me at all. We are just friends and we hook up from time to time.

I'm in college studying Information Technology and programming is the only thing that brings me any happiness or puts a smile on my face.

I sleep all day and barely have any motivation to go to class but I force myself to go and I have decent grades this semester but I have an overall GPA of 2.0 so I'm trying to raise it.

I don't like socializing anymore. I have 3 roommates that I share an on-campus apartment with and I try to avoid them since they're 18 years old and act superficial and just want to party all the time and gossip about people. I started taking 2 anti-depressants in August, Prozac and Wellbutrin, but I've been on anti-depressants since I was 18 years old in order to cope with the fact that my life sucks.

I've suffered from child abuse and neglect. I no longer talk to my older two brothers and my younger sister has autism and my mom abuses her too. Yells at her constantly. I can see her turning into a sociopath, to be honest, and she's often mean to me when I come home to visit, asking me to do things for her, and she's only 12. My oldest brother has called me ""fruit loops"" and ""crazy""

My mom expects me to babysit my sister and come home every weekend. I have no job, I'm in school full-time studying and broke and I'm absolutely miserable. Every week, I'm fighting with my mom about something and she outright tells me my life is in shambles. I barely have any strength to keep going, so for the first time in a while, I turned to praying the rosary since I'm Catholic.

I've been to therapists before and they're always speechless so that makes me feel more hopeless. Honestly, the only thing that's keeping me going is maybe my life will turn around once I graduate or maybe I'm at the beginning of a success story.

874,"debilitating, mostly religious-based OCD has just become much worse","Hey all, 

This is a long read and I don't intend offense to anyone's beliefs. It may also trigger others who suffer from OCD. And for those who don't, it may sound pretty strange. But it's all real, and I just... I need help.

I wrote here a bit ago because I'm still trying to get my act together at 31. Things have been really complicated due to a severe anxiety disorder, poor guidance in life, bad docs and therapists, and other unfortunate circumstances that just seem to keep piling up regardless of what I do.

But I'm writing today because all of that doesn't matter now. 

What matters now is that I need to figure out a brand new way to tackle my disorder directly because I seem to be losing the desire to live.

So I'm gonna do the best I can to describe what my disorder is like, and just...hope that maybe someone can give me an idea or strategy that I haven't employed yet.

I started out in a lax Catholic background, but towards the end of high school a friend of mine passed away. I think my OCD had already manifested by this point but it quickly focused on religion, I found myself doing a ton of research trying to prove that there was really a Heaven up there and that my friend was safe.

As a super-summary, here's what happened after that: I became a strict evangelical Christian and it was hard to find the line between how much of it was my genuine beliefs and how much of it was the severity of the disorder. I did a ton of research again, trying to prove that it was all real. I was obsessed with trying not to step a toe out of line, I threw away things I enjoyed because they were ""anti-christian,"" and I was terrified for my ""unsaved loved ones."" After a pastor and a close friend told me that some of those deceased loved ones were already in hell, I started to crack.

At this time, my disorder mixed together my fears of unsaved people, hell, the devil, and my own failures to create a weird OCD-driven situation. To summarize it as best I can, I basically feared that I might have the means to send people to hell myself. To lose their souls to the devil or to hell, so that when they die, that's where they go. It's always been my firm belief that *nobody* deserves to suffer for eternity, so you can imagine the distress this has caused.

After I started to crack a bit, I started trying to develop a more down-to-earth belief system, but by the end of 2016 I became an Atheist. On-paper, it solved everything. In real life, it solved very few things.

I now spent a ton of time researching, once again, this time trying to prove Christianity false. Trying to prove that all the things that have terrified me for years didn't exist.

My therapist never quite understood where I was coming from and treated me from a strictly CBT for OCD perspective. For 6 straight months, I did a daily exposure therapy imagination thing where I pictured myself and people I loved in hell. It was extremely intense, extremely upsetting, and as you can imagine since I'm writing here right now, it didn't work.

While managing the weight of my OCD-driven religious fears, added on to depression, I was barely able to get much done. I did manage to graduate college somehow, but I've yet to hold down a steady job. And because of the holes in the resume, I don't technically qualify for disability. 

So that's how I ended up here in life, where I am now, a month ago. In spite of my constant religious fears, in spite of my depression, in spite of the minor standard OCD issues I'd get (such as having trouble dropping mail into a mailbox and being certain that the mail successfully made it inside), I managed to beat myself up enough mentally to the point where I hated myself. I hated myself for not having my act together yet, for not having a job, for living at home with my mother at 31.

It was in this spurt of rage that I once again decided to try a different medication. The switch took place during the first two weeks of September, and by the middle of the month, something amazing happened. 

I now had full-blown traditional OCD.

Since the middle of the month, I've had trouble understanding certain things I read. I stare at the empty dryer because I'm not sure that I successfully collected all of the clothes from it. I send myself the same note 8 times because it will not ""click"" in my brain that the note was saved the first time. I know that first one might sound a bit strange, but this is all absolutely OCD. I'm sure of it. My therapist seems to agree, too.

I was unable to get in touch with my psych the weekend that I realized this was happening, so I switched myself back to my previous medication. For one reason or another (the official explanation from the doctors was ""dehydration"" and ""postural hypotension""), I passed out twice a few days later.

I stayed on my old medication, hoping it would balance out, hoping things would go back to...well, things weren't ""normal"" before September, but they certainly weren't *this.* Today I'm sad to report that things are still horrendous. I just spent a solid hour trying to understand the data settings on my phone, while, every couple of minutes, having to re-convince myself that I don't have power over souls and can't send anyone to hell.

The most frustrating thing about this is the fact that if I *knew* there was no god, if I *knew* Christianity was false, things would be much simpler. It's hard to tell myself that this 'souls' thing is just the OCD being OCD when a part of my brain still genuinely thinks that hell and the devil might be real.  But I've been down the research hole and haven't found a solid resolution. Maybe it's because the OCD blurs it, maybe it's because we just don't know anything for sure when it comes to religion, maybe I just look in the wrong places, I don't know.

What I know is this.

Without OCD, I know how to deal with data settings on my phone. I know that the mail went in the mailbox. I know that the note I saved on my phone is there. And while I did have shades of this type of OCD before last month, things weren't anywhere near as severe as they are now. My one and only hope is that my medication will balance out enough to start returning my brain to a state I'm used to dealing with.

The religion, however, is another story.

I want to tell myself, very, very badly, that it's all truly fake. That no matter how scared I become, I have no influence over people's souls, I'm not pissing off god, I'm not going to hell and nobody else is either. I need this. This isn't a want, it's a need. I need this to function.

Yet I'm also scared of hell, scared of going there, scared of other people going there. 

And so it shoves me into this situation that doesn't get resolved. 

And as desperate and hopeless as it's been, now I have the added bullshit of my OCD making everyday tasks insanely difficult.

I talk to my therapist again on Wednesday. I see my psych on Tuesday. I found a new place that claims to do psych and therapy nearby where I moved, and I see them in the middle of October. They're covered by my insurance (state insurance, since I don't have a job) which means there's a high chance that they're terrible, since almost everything covered by my insurance has been terrible.

I finally agreed to go to some special program my therapist kept wanting to send me to, some top program right over in Pennsylvania (I live in NJ), and they don't take my insurance either. So much for that.

I am out of hope. Totally out of it.

I don't know what else to do. I really don't.",1570156010.0

Some background.. My mom went back to work when I was 3 months and my 12 year old sister did computer schooling and took care of me. My sister told me that when I would cry at night my parents wouldnt come and get me, instead it was her. Both my parents worked a lot so I imagine she did a lot of babysitting from then on until I was 7. She moved out when she was 18 and I dont remember seeing her much after that. 

I think this is why I only get attached to female figures who are around my sisters age, its never been someone my moms age. I want to be hugged and comforted when I'm upset or scared. I want a mentor to take me under their wing. The first time I can remember fantasizing about this was when I was 5 years old which usually involved me getting sick, being in the hospital and getting comfort from nurses/ doctors. 

However, I can't have this, I'm too old. Im seeing a therapist but so far she hasnt had any advice on how to cope with this. I'm taking a full courseload at school and this issue is taking up a lot of brain space.

I love running but I barely run anymore. I used to take stairs 2 at a time, but I barely take stairs one at a time for fear of hurting my hip. I really want to get over this mental block. Is there any advice I can ask for ? I've been stuck for awhile now. And recently it has brought me down a lot. I cant seem to do anything more than sit down without my mind thinking about ways I'll fall or something

881,I hate where my life has gone since graduating college,"I graduated college in December. Lived down south in a city with a great economy, had lots of friends, I'm not really a ""city person"" but I enjoyed it, and while I was in college (full ride) I was financially independent and felt good.

But now, I'm stuck. I moved back in with my grandparents, partly because I didn't have anywhere else to go and partly because it got me back in the same area as my long-term girlfriend. My goal was to find a good job and a place to live and have a fun life with said gf. Grandparents left to go south for the winter, I moved in with my cousin across the state, more job applications, at that point mostly minimum wage stuff temporarily, as I was running low on money. But after 100+ job applications, I've gotten nowhere. Applications for good, career-type jobs in my field, applications for minimum wage crap, everything in between. I had one single call back, which got me an interview, and then I was rejected. The same day, gf dumped me. That was a month and a half ago. So now here I am, out of money, without a real job, with a degree no one seems to care about, living with my cousin with a sort-of deadline to get out by the end of summer, across the country from almost everyone I know, feeling those friendships starting to fade like all my friendships did back home, in a state that I've realized I have no desire to live in now that gf is gone. 

It seems the obvious answer is to move back south toward my friends, but after 50+ more job applications and rejection emails from all of them, it seems pointless to keep trying. I do have a summer job, which I enjoy, but the job only exists seasonally, and hasn't started yet. It was my fallback, and I was so sure I would have a career by now, and that's depressing in itself, as much as I like the job. And moving across the country to be near friends who haven't always been the most supportive feels like a waste too. My grandparents think it's a terrible idea, and want me to move back in with them and keep looking for work nearby, and my father hates the idea of me leaving the state ever. But I can't see myself being happy where I am at all, I really hate this place now. And where they are, my hometown, is at the top of my list of places I wouldn't mind never seeing again.

I'm not in the worst spot I could be in. I have a running vehicle, I don't have any debt, for now I have a place to stay, I do have a summer job, I have sort of a plan, even if I'm not sure about it. It's just hard to feel good about that stuff. Since I've graduated it's just been a long string of failures and disappointments and finding I've made poor choices, and the last five months just feels like a massive waste of life, and I'm afraid this is going to keep going.",1558433481.0

885,Not sure what hurts more.,"I decided I'm not going to my family's for christmas. Every year prior I would go and I would feel miserable the entire time. Not because they were bad people or anything, but because of the thoughts I had about myself. It would take me awhile to explain why I have these negative thoughts about myself, but lets just say my life took a nosedive in 2011 and I haven't really been able to steer the plane back up. No matter how many times I explain whats going on with me my family doesn't really understand. I think they even pity me. They don't know what it's like to be depressed for years, or to have OCD so bad that it makes you question your ability to life a remotely decent life. They don't know how much I struggle to even have a conversation with people because of my insomnia and lack of energy. Despite all that I still went, year after year. I am so ashamed of my life that even though I try to make conversation with people I dread that they ever ask me about me. Sometimes I would say I'm doing this or that, and stretch the truth a little, sometime it was the truth, but it never seemed to matter, I still felt bad, even when I thought I was doing alright. Now, I have decided that recovery is my main goal, and I guess this time around I didn't feel like telling people this. I didn't want to the same awkward stares. I didn't want to isolate myself and pretend to sleep to avoid all contact. I thought by not going I would feel better, but I don't. It's just another kind of pain. The truth is the only thing that I can think to do is to just keep working at my problems but I don't know how to live with the shame in front of other people. I've thought about leaving a lot, I can afford it, but not for long. I just want to be in a place where I can support myself so I can do this kind of painful growing away from judging eyes. I'll just say that my family wasn't the most supportive of me and leave it at that, but maybe the best thing to do for me is to just leave.

886,After spending years in a cycle of depression. I think it's time to start working toward a better me.,"So here's about to be a long word dump of just about everything. So heads up...

I decided to write this out, but also post it for future updates, reference, and hopes that this is this the right place for something like this.  


First off let me tell you a little about myself.  
I'm mid 20's, graduated college (b.a. broadcast journalism) , and have a job that is in my field of study that pays the bills.  
Both my parents were great, a little standoffish, but that's better in my opinion than being too hands-on with your children. My immediate family are good people, and I have myself one or two friends.

&#x200B;

My depressive episode started...going on 3 years ago when a girl that I very much loved, and had lived with for two years, left me for some random weed dealer.   
What I really hate is that I'd like to be over it...I don't want the girl back, or anything like that. But I still harbor this absolute anger and mistrust toward everything and everyone.   
Here was this person I had invested so much in, I was going to school 21 hours that semester, and working a full time job... I was barely trying to keep myself sane with all of that, and suddenly my own home/safe-haven was uprooted.  


I managed to push through and graduate that semester, I moved out of the house she left me alone to deal with, and move in with some friends.   


Now my friends who let me stay with them were great...although ultimately I feel like the kind of kicked me out.   
And in their defense, that's fair... I was a depressed mess, trying to finish school, resorting to smoking a TON of weed, and was really just not a great person to have living with you. They were a gay couple who were looking to get married soon, and I was probably getting in the way of that a little bit.   


After that I moved back home, and eventually into my own apartment.   


That anger and mistrust has subsided somewhat, but I've also been burying my pain with a lot of weed, fast food, and seclusion. I've been back here for about 2 years now, and I wish I had more to show for myself.

I wish i wasn't smoking all day every day. (nights, or just weekends would be nice)

I wish I was going out and meeting new friends more. 

I wish i was drawing more ( I go through episodes where I draw a lot, and then get discouraged, and stop for months.)

 and I wish I was just in a better place mentally and financially.  


I'm not at like rock-bottom or anything. I just feel like I'm still not back to ...me... after all of it. And I'd like to start being better.  
Every time I try, It's like I get too overwhelmed and slip back into my old habits and comfort zone. I feel like I'm perpetually locked in a slow spiral downward and I don't want to look at myself 10 years from now and see no progress.  


Today I woke up early for once. I also cleaned, went for a walk, and did some meditation...it seemed to help kind of set my mind right...or at least feel a little better.

892,"As a skinny guy, I decided to stop feeling sorry for myself.","I have been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember, and consequently have been prone to starving myself. Eating was always a chore for me and I became pretty skinny as a result (around 53-55kg for 175cm). I've always been seen as the weak dude, I was jealous over men my height that would have a normal figure (not even muscular guys, regular-sized guy mind you). 

Today, I bought a kitchen scale. I subscribed to an app that allows to count my calories and set a high goal of gaining 5kg by December (of course, if it's too hard of a goal I will adapt, even 5kg by 2019 would be a win. You can't go from 1000 calories/day to 3000 in a heartbeat). 

I've always had those moments when I tell myself to just be an adult and work on improving your life, without ever finding the motivation to do so (what's the point when you're convinced you're gonna kill yourself anyways). 

I will try my utmost best to keep my discipline and eat those calories I need to gain weight and finally stop being regarded and feel like a weak person.

For anyone in my situation, it shouldn't be too hard to gain weight. I know that it's awful to always being told ""just eat more brah"" etc, but really, my research have motivated me to do it.

894,"Worst depression in years, a month and a half since my girlfriend broke up with me","I am taking my meds rigorously, tried with my doctor two new adjustments but they didn't work out.

My girlfriend broke up with me because of my depression. She had been a major positive force in my life. I've strived not to transpire my depression to her. I consciously  smiled, cooked for her, helped her with cooking, socialized with her, worked hard as a freelancer to be able to visit her (she lives in another city), gave her meaningful presents and a lot of love. Somehow however it was transparent that I was depressed. Ironically, after I was rejected, this triggered severe depression in me, worst I've had in years.

Her rationale was that she could not view myself as a future husband due to me having incapacitating moments of inactivity while depressed. It is extremely painful to me to be living in this sort of self-fulfilling prophecy of hers; I was progressively improving and then I have this feeling that this was taken away from me.

I am unable to go to my classes, I am spending all day in my bed, mostly distracting myself on YouTube. I have progressively been eating better each week and also managing to read and study a bit more each week. Having some suicidal ideation.

Another source of great suffering for me is the shame of facing our very big shared social circle after this rejection. This is why I have deactivated Facebook and Instagram to avoid this.",1539661090.0

With small changes I’ve made every single day my life is finally starting to move in a positive direction. 

Unfortunately, while this has made me more confident in my abilities, my self-esteem has not improved a single bit. In fact I feel like I hate myself more than ever. Which doesn’t make sense because I am better than I ever was. I keep wondering when my list of accomplishments and abilities will be large enough for me to finally be able to love myself. Though I am probably aware that those things only give me temporary satisfaction, they don’t make me feel any less worthless and unlovable.

897,"I got dumped, and I don't think I'm gonna make it through this","I was just dumped by my girlfriend last night, and I don't know what to do. ""I can't really say I'm in love with you"" is what she said. This just came out of nowhere and I feel like I can't breathe. The day before yesterday I thought we were still madly in love, now I'm heartbroken. 

I just wish I knew what went wrong. I wish she would tell me that I did something wrong, tell me that I fucked up, tell me I had abhorrent personality traits, at least then I could make *some* sense of it. But she just said that she changed, and no longer felt the way she used to. She loves me but she's not *in love* with me anymore. How am I supposed to react to that? How can you say you love me on Sunday, then no longer be capable of loving me on Friday? She keeps insisting that I didn't do anything at all, that she wanted to feel it but couldn't; but how am I supposed to understand that? I'm just hurt and confused.

She stopped by my house last night to return some things I left in her apartment, one of my shirts she had (she kept the other one, and this one still smells like her 😢 ); and what really stings is that she returned the presents I gave her for Valentines this year. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I spent all night crying, I feel empty, like my heart has been ripped out of my chest. 

It's like I'm trapped in a nightmare I can't wake up from. Whenever I was with her all of my depression and anxiety just melted away. Despite all the bullshit I deal with on a daily basis, I always felt alright, because I knew that no matter what happened I had her beside me, and she made everything alright. I honestly don't know how I'm gonna make it through the rest of the year.

The worst part is how nonchalant she was. She seemed just so apathetic about it. Our relationship was amazing, we've been through so many good times, and I was always there for her when she was going through rough times, and she was there for me. But when dumping me she was so casual though, like we had only been on three dates. We were together for a year, and she didn't even seem to care. She said she doesn't see us having a future together; I saw us potentially getting married one day, I definitely saw a future with her. And she used to see one with me, I just don't know what changed.

I don't know how to deal with this. Without her I just feel dead inside. Just last week I was so happy, now I don't know how I'm gonna live without her. She was the best thing that ever happened to me, now I feel like my heart is shattered in a million pieces. She said she doesn't think she was the right girl for me, but we were perfect together. I don't think I could ever find anyone else as amazing as her.

The only one I feel like I can turn to at this moment is my best friend. They try to be sympathetic, but they're more of a tough love kind of person, they tell me to put my dating profile back online right away, right now; but I'm a crying mess right now, and I don't feel ready to try to date again.

899,How do you survive depression?,"I am very new to reddit so please let me know if I’ve done something incorrectly. 

I’m 25 and female. I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for about as long as I can remember. I’ve been on antidepressants for about ten years now. I’ve tried a lot of SSRI’s with various levels of success. But every year or so, I reach the point of trying something different, so even the ones that work for a while don’t stick. 

I’ve done CBT for about two years, but recently split with my therapist after she said she didn’t know how to help me. I’m seeing a new one that I like okay, but I know it will be a long road ahead. I usually get worse before I get better with that sort of thing, but I am more than a little terrified that I won’t handle worse. 

This particular slump started about the beginning of this year. I wouldn’t say that it’s worse than I’ve experienced before, but it’s probably running a close second. My anxiety got so crazy high at work that I quit. Job hunting is difficult when you don’t consider yourself hirable. And considering I really needed my income to pay rent, things are also on a bit of a time crunch, for additional pressure. 

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow, first one since I changed meds three months ago. She said we might “look into other options” if this didn’t work. Not sure exactly what that means. I wondered if anyone had recommendations. Obviously this wouldn’t replace seeking medical treatment yadda yadda, but I would just like to know what other people have had success with. 

Also, if you have a success/depression survival story, I would love to hear it. Trying very hard to believe this is only a rough patch and not a rough forever. TIA",1532982645.0

She told me that if I was calling after a year, then it was clearly nothing serious. She also asked me: ""So you're suffering from depression after just *a single violence*?"" in a tone of disbelief.

OK, I'm weak, there are people who can endure much more much better than me. But this made me feel so wrong.

She asked me some really direct and rude questions about what happened to me and it was painful to answer.

903,I went to dinner with my brother! *Bonus points for being sober.,"TL;DR: My estranged brother invited me to dinner and I accepted. Things went well. My plans for the night were to drown in IPAs. Instead I drove home without stopping for alcohol. I feel less alone.  
  
A couple years ago if you asked me if I would see or even speak to my brother without forced interaction I would have laughed it off. We legitimatly have seen each other in public and didn't bat an eye at one another.  
  
We have always been somewhat estranged. He was withdrawn and shy. While I acted out and was aggressive.  
  
I was abused by a relative by marriage as a child. When the abuse came to light, it split the family up. My parents believed me thankfully. I knew I was giving up my aunt and cousins. My oldest brother, who was always volatile, made it clear his stance was I am a lying bitch.  
My other brother never said anything about it. He lived with our dad and I lived with our mom. Essentially we didn't have to see eachother and never talked.  
  
About a year and a half ago, he randomly approached me. Sparked a conversation. It was very strange and awkward for me. He started acknowledging me when I'd see him. Which became more frequent as he was living with my mom again. He ended up starting another conversation.  
  
Idk how it got serious. We started bonding over our shitty childhood with our parents. He acknowledged that he saw my effort in being a better person.  
I blurted out at somepoint, ""I didn't lie.""  
To my surprise he said, ""I know"".  
It was an incredibly validating.  
  
Tonight he sent a text asking what I was doing; if I wanted to catch dinner. It was really random and I honestly thought something bad had happened.  
  
Nope, he just wanted to grab dinner. Said he didn't want to go eat alone.  
  
Frankly, I was planning on drinking my face off by myself tonight. I have been self medicating lately. Dinner was really nice and we talked a lot. After dinner I decided to drive straight home instead of going to the store for alcohol.  
  
It's a big feat for me. I payed for dinner and he said he'd pay next time. NEXT TIME! He still talks to my abuser and his wife which I have mixed feelings about. But hey, maybe this is a start.

904,I owned my life when I stopped living up to people’s expectations,"My journey to change my life started years ago when my depression took a high curve and almost cost me my life. Since then I’m still committed to the decision I made back then to reinvent every area of my life, and live a fulfilling life. The level of pain i hit that time of my life shock my existence to the core and brought me face to face with the hardest truth of my life. I realized I’ve been living a life that didn’t reflect who i truly was, or what i wanted to create out of it. I’ve been living according to expectations of others and society. I decided that i no longer accept to be, think, feel, or behave as expected. This was the day I allowed myself to live a life true to myself no matter what. 

Working hard and being successful only to meet the expectations drained me emotionally. I used to believe that as a girl I had to hide my feelings because showing them would mean I was too weak to be perceived as successful. So I often acted as a strong person even at the times i most needed help. To me success, respect, and a good quality of life meant i had to be a certain way and keep my emotions to the side. In a modern society where there’s more pressure to be, do, and have, sometimes our feminine side gets buried under pressure and work. Our emotions suffer because we forget a valuable and an essential side of who we are and what we need. 

Living up to expectations is like wearing a mask and hiding our true identity to show somebody else that we are who they think we are. The conflict between our true identity and the fake one creates unbearable amounts of emotional pain. At a certain point our energy is drained and the mask starts to wear out. At that time we’re either lucky to use the pain as a wakeup call or we let the moment pass us by and gets the best of our lives leaving us with the bitterness of regret. 

years ago i was on the floor of my then one-bedroom apartment all alone and crying at the lowest point of my life. Back then I knew that if i let this moment pass me by without using it to turn my whole life around, I would live the rest of my life in regret (if I live at all!). That moment defined my life and it put everything into perspective. All of a sudden, things, people, and life had a different meaning and taste. I was no longer able to live out of fear to let somebody down, instead my values, beliefs, and vision became my compass to never get lost again. 

My advice to anyone who’s stuck in expectations, is to free yourself out. You’re far more fulfilled and useful to others when you live life according to your standards and choices. Disappointing some people might be a by product at first, but the ones that truly love and care about you will get it. Only then you have the power to be, and give more to yourself and to others. It’s fascinating how much we’re willing to do for others and not as much for ourselves. But know that if anybody deserves to be given anything, it would be you deserving freedom to live the kind of life you decide. 

Wish you freedom and fulfillment.

905,I owned my life when I stopped living up to people’s expectations,"My journey to change my life started years ago when my depression took a high curve and almost cost me my life. Since then I’m still committed to the decision I made back then to reinvent every area of my life, and live a fulfilling life. The level of pain i hit that time of my life shock my existence to the core and brought me face to face with the hardest truth of my life. I realized I’ve been living a life that didn’t reflect who i truly was, or what i wanted to create out of it. I’ve been living according to expectations of others and society. I decided that i no longer accept to be, think, feel, or behave as expected. This was the day I allowed myself to live a life true to myself no matter what. 

Working hard and being successful only to meet the expectations drained me emotionally. I used to believe that as a girl I had to hide my feelings because showing them would mean I was too weak to be perceived as successful. So I often acted as a strong person even at the times i most needed help. To me success, respect, and a good quality of life meant i had to be a certain way and keep my emotions to the side. In a modern society where there’s more pressure to be, do, and have, sometimes our feminine side gets buried under pressure and work. Our emotions suffer because we forget a valuable and an essential side of who we are and what we need. 

Living up to expectations is like wearing a mask and hiding our true identity to show somebody else that we are who they think we are. The conflict between our true identity and the fake one creates unbearable amounts of emotional pain. At a certain point our energy is drained and the mask starts to wear out. At that time we’re either lucky to use the pain as a wakeup call or we let the moment pass us by and gets the best of our lives leaving us with the bitterness of regret.

All I could think about during that time was how I wished I could do the things I needed to do, like do my coursework or tidy the growing pile of junk in my room. So now that I'm in recovery, all I can think to do is spend my days organising my stuff and getting productive things done, until I'm ready to collapse and maybe watch some Netflix or go straight to bed.

I feel like I'm not really sure what to do with myself. I've tried taking time out and saying ""this is your leisure time, have fun with it"", and then I stare at my computer for a while and end up checking my emails or my to-dos and feeling antsy that I'm not doing anything. The stuff I used to enjoy, like drawing or reading, doesn't really seem to have much appeal. When I was very depressed I was mostly scrolling through Reddit or Facebook or playing video games or marathoning TV/films as escapism but I don't think they give me much real joy. I was getting into running but found it hard to sustain with how hot this summer's been, so I'm giving up until the weather cools down.

I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I need to take time to learn how to relax and enjoy myself properly otherwise I'm just going to overwork myself and go into another episode.

910,My anxiety is stopping me from achieving anything I actually want,"So for the past 7 months I've been going through a phase of severe depression. 8 months ago I was ready to kill myself and had started planning on how I would do it. My doctor prescribed me effexor, which was a nightmare of its own. But with CBT counselling, I was able to set myself clear goals of what I want and slowly get back my will to live. 

So I was looking for a job so I could save and move to Berlin, but a friend who lives there told me that his work are hiring and I should apply. He also explained how many other places are looking to hire english speaking people. I thought ""why not? I would be doing the exact same thing where I currently am, but it would be easier there"". So I moved and felt like I could deal with any anxiety I had because I was pursuing something that I really wanted.

I was very wrong though. I went to meet some people who were looking for a roommate, but had an anxiety attack on the way to meet them and just didn't go. I've been staying with my friend and his girlfriend while I find a place to stay, but I don't see how I can tell them without them getting mad. I've still been applying to apartment ads but every time I get a reply and someone wants to meet, I am on the verge of having another anxiety attack.

Now I've got no motivation to look for a job here or an apartment. I'm only doing it now so I can tell my friend that I did something while he was at work. I don't see how accomplishing any of these things can change how I feel now. I don't even feel strongly about being in Berlin. I'm only here now because I would be doing the same shit at home.

I don't see how getting a job or a place to live can bring any change to how I feel, besides adding more pressure. I also can't find anything that makes the general pain of being alive any easier. I've lost all motivation for doing the things I love(mostly music). The only thing stopping me going back home right now is that I would have to deal with the embarrassment of failing and coming home week later. I've started having suicidal ideations again, almost all the time.

But I figured before I got up, I'd read a little more in my book, and I tried the meditation exercise on mindfulness of sounds and thoughts.   

The basic idea is to focus on the sounds you hear, whatever they may be, without judgement, and realize that your ear hears the sounds of the world as the pass through the present.   Then shift the focus to thoughts and realize that the mind hears thoughts in the same way, as they pass through the present.  These thoughts aren't me, and are not really mine, they are just thoughts passing through.   

I don't know what happened, but the upset in my stomach went away, and the tightness in my chest diminished, and now I feel like maybe I can get a few things done (in the present, one thing at a time) without getting overwhelmed and anxious.

912,Tips on how to overcome depression,"I just wanted others who are suffering from depression to know how to beat it. I have defeated depression. :)

I suffered from it before. Then I was happy. And then I was said again. Deep sadness and hopelessness. And yet it's over now, I feel so much better, I smile every minute of every day and feel so calm.

I invite you to do the things that have helped me:

*  Exercise. Start small, as simple as taking a 20 minute walk into the park can help. Do some stretching or push ups if you don't want to go outside.

*  Meditate. Watch some videos on youtube on how to do it. Simply let go off all thoughts, good or bad, and focus on your breath. When your mind starts drifting bring it back to your breath. Meditation specifically helped me to learn to love myself again. And not feel lonely. After I meditate, I no longer feel alone and I know what it feels to be alone all the time (even when you are in a room full of people and people ask you how are you? **""I'm fine""**).

*  Give in to your emotions. Cry if it helps. Listen to music that helps you feel more. Don't think, don't judge yourself. Just take deep breaths while listening and try to feel.

*  Don't hold grudges against the world. You **ARE** worthy of happiness. Yes, you with all your imperfections, even if society has fooled you that you're not worthy. They are liers. If you still don't believe that you are worthy you have to repeat to yourself everyday that you ARE worthy of happiness until you believe it.

Also watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rudZejwyOPc and watch other videos from this guy, they helped me so much.

Please don't lose hope and stay strong. There is light at the end of the tunnel. You are not alone :)

914,My dog saved my life,"My dog likes to stay outside.  He's an adventure-dog.  He likes going new places and meeting new people.  He can't stand being confined in small spaces.  Once I brought him to a party and he made it his mission to give every party guest a present.  Every time a new person came in, he would get a dog toy and give it to them.

I tried so hard to raise this dog right.  I gave him space.  I made sure he had friends.  Fed him the best of foods.  He was trained by an ex-roadie for the grateful dead who fucking GOT dog psychology.

The happiest I've ever seen him was when we went to a little island off the coast of Maine.  I let him off leash and he went exploring.  A few hours later, as we were all sitting around the campfire, he came back, laid down, and licked all the mud out of his fur.  And he just looked content.  Totally mellow, totally happy.

He's the reason I didn't kill myself.  He's got the parts of me that I love.  He wants freedom.  He wants adventure.  He wants to help people.  He wants to be loved.  If he's hurt, I'm hurt.  I can't stand seeing him confined.

And he inspires me.  I want to be in mutually beneficial relationships like we have.  I want to be appreciated.  I want people to tell me that I'm cute, and I'm smart, and I'm (someone actually said this about my dog) ""a saint"".",1427245815.0
915,How i got over it,"In the abyss of my depression this seddit helped a lot and i always said if i got better id give back. So here's some inspiration to you.

I started getting over it by reminding myself of the point of time in my life when i was happy and couldn't see myself even proportionately depressed. This reminded me that i was in the same state of mind in my depression but simply at opposite ends. This helped a lot in believing i could get over it. And believing in something is everything, you must believe in something either in yourself, God or the process of getting better, it doesn't matter, believe in something. 

2. I took complete control of my life and my interactions with people. I believe successful people are people who know how to manage expectations and manage them well.  I also understand what's in my control and what's not. This was key because a lot of the shit i was depressed about was due to not being in control of people & situations i simply didn't have control over. The fact that your parents treated you like shit, your girlfriend abandoned you, your friends bailed on you the second they thought they had a chance to be cool was not your fault and most importantly out of your control, let it go. Also it says more about them than you. 

3. I started creating strong and good boundaries. (however, watch out for turning boundaries into walls) People that come from fucked up childhoods or what not have horrible boundaries that plague them most of their life and leads them into being in shitty ass friendships or relationships and what not. For example, your mom wanted you to play dad as a kid because your dad wasn't around and she was short on money. This was not your job or problem but the situation forced you into this role. This just confuses the fuck out of you and your expectations of relationships in your life. Having played this role, you'll likely expect more out of relationships than you should because this was the only examples you've had and it leads you to believe that love means to be self sacrificing which is not. And when others aren't self sacrificing for you, you'll believe they don't love you or even worst you'll try to manipulate others into loving you by sacrificing yourself. its a horrible cycle break it. 

4. The last piece of the puzzle is to understand that no one is coming to save you, you need to get your ass up and do something about your depression or its not going to get better. Again, the cruelty of life is not in your control, let it go.

916,This book on cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me more than anything,"*Note: I originally posted this in the ""depression"" subreddit but the mods let me know that this subreddit is a more appropriate place to post it. Thanks.*


If anyone is looking for a helpful resource, ""Feeling Good"" by David D. Burns, MD has been a substantial help to me. You can get it for about $5 on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-The-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336

I was hesitant to read this at the recommendation of a therapist, and put off ordering it for many months. I am so glad I finally came around. This book is very well grounded in the reality that people with depression face. It isn't hokey or gimmicky, and it has made me realize I am not alone. I am making progress, and, while I realize it will probably take several more months of reading and therapy, I am genuinely getting better and feeling better than I have in years.

I'm in my mid-twenties, in graduate school, and only recently came to terms with the fact that I am suffering from severe depression (what has felt ""normal"" for years has actually been illness.) I should add that this is a resource that is best to use in addition to professional care.

As I didn't have a ton of time to prepare or promote this event and my participation I kept the goal relatively low.  Even so it seems I may miss the modest goal of $300.

918,Motivational Monday: Kindness towards yourself / p.s. we are still looking for another moderator,"Good morning,

I've been attending an educational anxiety management workshop, and we did this meditation called **Loving Kindness** that I found really helpful and wanted to share. People struggling with depression, anxiety or other mental illnesses often see themselves and the world in a negative light. You may be very hard on yourself or you may think badly about yourself for being the way you are.

It is important to remember to treat yourself with patience, kindness, compassion and acceptance. If you're reading this, you're here because you're ready for change and you're trying to make positive steps in your life. That's great and it's worth celebrating. When you make mistakes, be kind to yourself. When you feel like you've failed, be patient with yourself. You are worth the same compassion you would give to your friend or a loved one.

**[Here](http://www.thinkinghealthy.com.au/page6.php)** is a script for meditation that you can follow to practice kindness towards yourself. Here is an excerpt:

> *Take your usual posture for meditation... feel your body where it makes contact with the support beneath you, and settle in... perhaps center yourself by making the breath the focus of your attention... Feel the breath moving and the body sitting...*

> *And when you are ready, bring to mind someone that it is easy to feel loving kindness towards... someone from the past or present, perhaps a child, or a pet - an easy, simple relationship may be best...*

> *Allow yourself to hold them in your awareness perhaps see them in your mind’s eye or perhaps feel a sense of them in your heart... can you feel a sense of loving kindness towards them?*

> *As you hold them in your awareness, begin to send wishes of loving kindness to them... Silently repeat these phrases:*

> *May you be peaceful and happy*

> *May you be safe from harm*

> *May you be as healthy and strong as you can be*

> *May you live with ease of well-being ...*

> *When you’re ready, allow the image or felt sense of your chosen one to fade, and see how it is for you to be the one who receives loving kindness... Rest here in your own kind regard, sending yourself these well wishes, allowing yourself to take in these phrases, to say them silently for yourself...*

> *May I be peaceful and happy*

> *May I be safe from all inner and outer harm*

> *May I be as healthy and strong as I can be*

> *May I live with ease of well-being ...*

> *Maybe it seems artificial and stilted to say such things to yourself, for yourself... maybe you’re not feeling loving kindness in this moment - and that’s OK. Whatever you’re feeling, you can hold the intention of loving kindness... offering it from wherever you are... however you are now.*

I hope it helps you find some peace and love for yourself.

~~And finally, as a follow-up to our recent Mod Monday posts, **we are still looking for a third moderator!** It's super easy and a great way to get more involved.

919,defusing negative emotions trick,"*Cure depression with this 1 weird trick discovered by a stay at home mom!*

...kidding..

When I am irrationally angry and aware enough to want to defuse myself, I force myself to flood my mind with moments that I am grateful to them for. Even my most triggering people I can interpret events to make me feel gratitude for them. This takes a certain degree of critical thinking skills. But it completely defuses any hostilities I have towards someone every time I've used it.

For defusing self hatred I similarlly force myself to think of all the kind acts ive done for anyone ever, all the things ive accomplished no matter how minute. I think its healthy to keep track of your accomplishments periodically to show you are capable of doing things you want to. Defusing self hatred is far harder for me because it never occurs to me to use the trick.

For defusing misery and indulging in introspective thought traps (I dont know how to describe them, but hopefully you know what im talking about), the most effective thing ive got is forcing myself to appreciate something cool. There are so many bizarre and cool or interesting things around and just focusing on the improbable amazingness of the world is a positive distracting tool for me. And build up my optimism at the same time. How have smartphones come so far so fast, how does light defuse, how do stretch marks work physically, distract yourself in the details.

**tl;dr** 

Anger<=Gratitude

Misery<=Appreciation/Wonder 

These are short term in the moment solutions, but the anger one at least has more or less fixed the problem all together. Still testing out the second one but its pretty effective to defang emotions so far.",1390806808.0
920,Ready to kick it- need a partner.,"I've been a lurker here for years, finally made an account to specifically post this.

I graduated in 2011 with a BFA in Illustration and amazing opportunities, and have been the most depressed I've ever been since then, with occasional reprieves.  In the past, when I have decided I'm ready to be happy, I've been able to claw my way out.  Right now I'm pretty terrified, because I made that decision over the summer and despite truly the MOST and BEST effort I've made, right now I feel as terrible as I can ever remember.

I don't actually want to get into all the gritty details, because it's stuff that most of you are completely familiar with.  What I really want, and the reason I'm breaking the silence, is a partner.  

Two things that really help me are A) talking about it, and B) being accountable to someone.  I want someone who can help me create a super micromanaging, minute-by-minute program for myself for every day.  I need someone who is at home, or at least at a computer, most days, with whom I can be in almost constant contact.  I want someone who can stomach being told every minute detail of my life, and who could see themselves building enough of a relationship with me to want to help me recover.

I think probably (and ideally) this means another depressed person who is also ready to kick the habit.  So anyway, that's my pitch.  I'm 24, I'm a lady, I work as an illustrator, those are the essential facts.  If you think this kind of program could help you too, please get in touch.  Maybe we can even make a little Group of Accountability with it.

921,[Mod post] Motivational Monday - should I?,"We say 'should' a lot. I should do some exercise. I should stop feeling sorry for myself. I should tell my mum. Or we say ought, or must, or need to... they mean the same.

They're words that make us feel guilty if we don't do it. They're words that stress us out by placing an obligation on us. They're words that make us feel bad for not already having done it.

They're not good words for us. Try and catch yourself every time you use 'should' - you'll be surprised, it's usually an awful lot. Banning it from our vocabulary can actually make us feel a lot better.

Instead of saying 'should' you can replace it with something like these:

* 'I could do some exercise later, if I feel like it'

* 'I've got time to do my homework tomorrow'

* 'It'd be nice to get out of the house today'

* 'I could do the tidying up, but I'm too tired so I'm going to rest instead'

They are all a lot more forgiving on ourselves! Using these alternatives can make you feel much less stressed.

Practice this and it becomes a habit not to use should any more, and you get used to using new phrases instead. In the long run it leads to a more positive way of thinking and keeps your mood up.

B - Just because I don't possess the same attributes as someone else doesn't make me qualitatively inferior to that person.

D - It's unfair to both me and the person I'm comparing myself to because it assumes that I am not capable of achieving what I desire.

923,The Worst Year,"When I was 18 I moved by myself to a big city. I was young and idealistic and naive and I was going to change the world. Except maybe I wasn’t. I didn’t know anyone in there, and all my co-workers were college grads who went out to the bars together after work. I spent a lot of time working on college applications alone in my room and watching a lot of Netflix. I had a roommate who seemed really nice. Until I figured out the whole alcoholic thing. She threw a lot of really loud parties and I would hide in my room and try and work and cry a lot. More then I should. 
I vaguely knew most of the people at these parties. Lots of them were people  I worked with. But they weren’t my friends, they were hers, so I would hide. One night, in December- a date that will always be etched in to my brain- years later I spend the whole day panicking- one of the guys I kind of knew decided it was time to bring me out of my room. Except he didn’t.  Except he kissed me, and I really didn’t want him to. Except he undressed me and I really didn’t want him to. He told me he had always thought I was pretty. It took me a year and a half for me not to panic whenever someone told me I was pretty. He raped me, and he thought he was doing me a favor. He was proud of himself, and then I was alone in the corner of my own bed, in my own room- the place that had been my one safe space wasn’t so safe anymore.

I tried to tell my roommate the next morning. She laughed and said that I had always thought he was cute. That wasn’t true, but even if it was, that wasn’t a reason. That wasn’t an excuse. Except to her it was. To her it meant everything was ok. 

Everything was not ok. I was already withdrawn but I became much more so. I stopped leaving my room except to go to work. I stopped going to work. I sat alone in my room and read. I watched stupid videos on the internet. I tried my hardest to get out of my own head but nothing worked.

And I was determined that no one would ever find me pretty again.  Pretty is what makes people hurt you. Pretty is why he hurt me.  

I was never a skinny kid, but over the course of about 2 months I gained about 70 pounds. If I was fat enough no one would love me, right? 

The depression was bad. I called my dad and told him I couldn’t be in the city anymore, and he came and picked me up. We packed up the car and I cried for the entire 10 hour drive home.
I sat alone in my bedroom at home. I never showered. I wouldn’t talk to my parents. How could I tell them what happened? I was ashamed. I was embarrassed. It was my fault anyway- why would I let it happen? Why didn’t I just leave the apartment? Why did I just lie there? Why didn’t I say no a few more times?
It drove me crazy. Not in the colloquial way—actually medically crazy. I started hearing voices in my head. They would whisper to me at night. Tell me I was useless and that no one would ever love me again. How could they? I started to believe them. So I decided I would kill myself. 

I sat on my bed and googled drug dosages. I figured I could just OD on my prescriptions.  I had plenty of meds in my room, so why not put them to good use? I took a lot of pills. A lot of pills. 
Then I broke down. I ran down the hall to my dad, and told him what I had done. He cried and my mom cried and the next thing I remember we were at the hospital and my mouth was black and tasted funny. The stomach pump must have hurt, but I don’t remember any of it. I was already numb. I had hurt so much already, what was a little more?
They asked me a lot of questions, and I tried not to look at my dad crying. I told them about the pills, but not about that night in the city. It didn’t feel important. It felt like I was making a big deal out of something stupid. It felt unimportant. I felt unimportant. 

I stayed in the mental hospital for almost 2 weeks. I was 18 years old, which meant I stayed in the adult ward. I felt like a baby. I felt like my problems were insignificant and I was embarrassed about them. Why should I make such a big deal out of one stupid action one night in the city when the guy I’m eating lunch with had tried to hang himself after his wife left him? He showed me the rope burn on his neck. I tried not to cry.
On Valentine’s Day a 65 year old schizophrenic made me a card. He called me the “prettiest girl in the mental ward.” 

The word “pretty” still made me flinch.

I started, slowly, to be ok with being alive. 

It took me 8 months till I kissed someone again. It was ok. But I still felt ashamed. 

It took me a year to put on makeup. It still sometimes feels like a mask I hide behind.

It took me a year and half to start wearing dresses again. I’ve worn them a lot this year. It’s my way of saying that 

I’m not afraid to be a little bit pretty. People think it’s strange that I insist on  dressing up, but it’s my own little bit of defiance. 

I’m not ok. I don’t know if I ever will be. But I’m working on it. I have some good friends now. Ones who listen when I tell them my stories. Ones who hug me. Ones who call me pretty, and don’t even notice when I flinch a little, because they truly meant it. 

Maybe one day I will tell my parents. Maybe one day I will tell that guy how much he wrecked me.

Maybe.

I’m still young. I’m still naive, though not as much as I used to be.  I could still change the world, but first I need to change myself. Rebuild myself. Heal. It’s  a process. But I’m trying.

925,Finally feeling hope that I can get passed my wife's infidelity ,"My wife cheated on me four years ago with a coworker of mine. The feelings of betrayal were the worst pain I have ever experienced. I originally stayed in the relationship because we had one young boy together. Over time  I began to realize that I still loved my wife and agreed to try to work through things. We struggled through many ups and downs, had another boy, and fought more often than we liked. I recently started seeing a physiologist because I have ADD and she is acting as my coach. The topic of infidelity came up and I expressed to my doctor that I felt hopeless in ever trusting my wife again. She told me that many couples successfully move past infidelity, but the first step is to realize that my wife can't earn my trust if I'm not willing to give it to her. Now when I start feeling suspicious instead of searching for proof that she may be cheating I look for proof that she still loves me. This feels like a major breakthrough for me and I'm happy to finally have some hope that I can get over that period of my life and move on. ",1357739067.0
926,Just broke up with my boyfriend of two years in an effort to help myself get better. It's terrifying.,"Hi everyone, I feel like I should be posting to /r/relationships or /r/BreakUps but that just feels too ""real"" for me right now.

I just broke up with my boyfriend of over two years. We were friends, then roommates, then partners. This fall I moved out because I realized I needed to experience living on my own, and I wasn't sure how I felt about him. It was the hardest thing I ever did, until tonight.

It was my first relationship, and it was very serious very fast. We became very dependent on one another, and although the move was a healthy step towards independence, I just felt like I couldn't stay in the relationship.

This semester I've struggled with my feelings for my boyfriend, the move, my grandfather's passing, and discontinuing my medication (have been taking several different antidepressants for almost two years, with little results). I've had more panic attacks than ever, desperate moments of need and fear, and a terrible outlook on life.

I am doing this for my own good. I want to learn to love myself and accept my flaws. I don't want to depend on someone else to feel good about myself. I have already made some progress. I've been living alone for two months and being more social. But I am terrified of being single, being on my own, and feeling abandoned. It figures that it was my own choice to make that a reality.

Do you have any advice? I am brokenhearted and scared. I care about him a lot. I hope that one day I can be happy and healthy enough to be in a serious relationship again. Maybe with him. For now, I am just trying to get through this.",1354155444.0
927,"I'm taking steps to fix my depression and anxiety, but it seems there are a lot of times where I feel like I don't want to change.","I'm seeing a psychologist and my friends and family are often asking me how I'm going and are willing to talk to me, I'm not on any medication but I'm taking steps to get myself sorted.

But I often feel like I don't want things to change, and I feel like it would be easier for me to just remain scared and unhappy. When I feel like this, I think that being this way kind of protects me from the real world, and is kind of an excuse for how my life has turned out.

Is this a normal thing to feel? or am I just kind of being a pussy or an attention whore?

What should I do to get over this?

Edit: thanks for all the responses. It's really encouraging to hear that what I'm feeling is normal, and it's good to hear that it gets better when I get past this. It makes the feeling of not wanting to change seem a lot weaker, and gives me motivation to get over my problems. Thanks again.",1336989386.0
928,I've run out of friends,"I hope you don't mind if I tell a bit of a life story.  You can skip to the last two paragraphs if you're lazy.

Strangely, I often felt not a part of groups or cliques I was clearly in.  Even in grade school, I still felt outside of my ground of friends.  This was a group of me and two other people, and I felt like I didn't belong.  

In High School I had two groups, one which I was definitely a part of (and felt it) and one which I didn't feel like a part of.  In the second group there were several people who strongly disliked me.

In college, I had a constant best friend, who was female (I'm male).  Besides her, I had two groups of friends; the first one was a 12+ group of video game nerds, all guys.  I spent (wasted, really) a huge part of my college years watching them play video games.  

After 2nd year, everyone was planning to get an apartment.  We spent a great deal of time trying to find an arrangement of roommates.  No one ever wanted to room with me.  I was oblivious of this fact until it was explicitly pointed it out me, loudly, in front of the rest of the group.  Later another friend told me that they were talking behind my back.  At this point it was clear that I should find new friends, but for some reason I did not.  

I did make an attempt to form another group, made up of me, my earlier mentioned best friend, another reject from the above group, and fourth person.  It worked well until one of them created drama and destroyed the group :-/  We all remained friends, but did not have group get-togethers.

Finally in 4th year I got a serious girlfriend.  I left all my other friends.  When college ended and I got a full time job (the one I would eventually lose), I found myself friendless except her.  I initially panicked, but I quickly formed a group of four with some acquaintances.  That group was pretty amazing.  Eventually, my relationship fell apart.  The friend group still went well for a while, but one of the friends got busy with work and another friend I rejected (long story).  That leaves the person who is currently my best friend and me.  And that's been my friend group for over six months.

I visited OccupySF a few times last fall and it had a profound effect on me.  Most people judge Occupy Wall Street by its political nature, but I see it as a powerful emotional experience.  I was uncertain about my career future and talking it out with people who were outside the mainstream economic system gave me some perspective.  When it got colder, I stopped visiting.

Then, I lost my job 2 months ago. I figured in my new free time I had no excuse not to go back to Occupy.  For some reason, I resisted going, with some strange anxiety about the trip.  Finally, I got over the anxiety, and on Saturday I visited Occupy Oakland.  

The people at Occupy are so different than normal people you see in real life.  Everyone is so different, but everyone so welcoming and nice-- they welcome you and engage you in discussion freely, and no one judges.  I'm deeply fascinated and really want to fit in, but I feel like I don't.  I can't understand logically why I feel that way; the movement doesn't have a membership list.  

No matter what, I feel like I'm outside somehow, that I'm not connected to any of them.

I can't connect deeply with people anymore.  Somewhere along the way I lost it.  In school, it was just so damn easy; I made friends in a day that would last until we went to different schools. Now everyone feels more distant.  People are 20+ minutes by car away; we have to communicate by phone or text.  People don't collect in cafeterias and sit in groups.  People don't want to make friends, or if they do, they do it on dating sites or Facebook instead of real life.

930,Baby steps - learning to live with depressive tendencies and stop sabotaging myself,"I've been under a lot of stress lately, and I fell about six weeks behind in school. Normally, I would have considered that insurmountable and let myself crash and burn. Then I would have felt miserable about being a failure.

But that gets really tiring, doesn't it? So I did the following: 

1) I was completely forthcoming with my psychiatrist. This was hard, because I'm pretty private and tend to act like I'm doing better than I am. Now I'm on two antidepressants. That's ok. I'm legitimately under a lot of stress.

2) That plus supplementing with iron and vitamins B and D and watching my diet has really helped my ability to concentrate. (I also have diabetes and tend towards low iron, so that plays into it.)

3) I've isolated myself from people that cause me stress, and reached out to those that don't. Encouraging words help keep me on track. 

4) Dealt with the important things I was putting off, like taking my medical documentation to the Dean's office. I figured that if people can make obnoxious and outlandish requests without shame, I should be able to make a respectable one without shame.

5) I just sat down and started working under the material. At first I needed a study buddy to make sure I was actually doing my work instead of getting discouraged and distracted, but then I built some momentum and it was easier. My new kitten is also keeping me from getting too lonely while I spend hours alone in silence studying.

I've covered almost all 125 pages of material for Chemistry in the last week. Even if I don't do well on my midterm, I'm proud of myself. I tried really hard and I didn't give up. I have depressive tendencies, that's true, but I can develop strategies to work around that. Depression also helps me have empathy for others. 

TL;DR: I've decided to accept my limitations and take care of myself, but also be firm about pushing myself and ending self-sabotage.",1321086794.0
931,Today I decided I am done with depression.,"I have struggled with depression for over four years. I have gotten sad for no reason. Hurt by comments that meant nothing. I have had panic attacks so bad that I passed out. I have hurt myself, and I have had suicidal thoughts. And recently, my depression may have cost me one of the few people I have ever allowed myself to trust implicitly. I have come to realize that my depression isn't just ruining my life, it's affecting everyone around me.

So I have decided today that I'm done with it. I saw a doctor this afternoon for the first time in years. I got things off my chest, I sought help. And I was given the tools to take the first steps toward recovery. I will be taking medications and talking to a councilor to help overcome my issues.

935,why do I have to keep taking 2 steps backward?,"the last few months I've tried so hard to move forward, but problems keep coming at me. I feel so disconnected from everyone. I've been trying to build myself a social circle after losing my last one, but it's so unbelievably tiring. I think I'm still burnt out. I don't really have anyone I'm that close to. I'm trying, but I'm failing. maybe I'm just impatient, but it feels useless. everyone I'm trying to be closer to already has their life built. I feel like an intruder. like I don't belong anywhere. everyone already has their bubble, so I can't join anyone's without breaking it. 

As a result of this, my social anxiety has grown a lot. the feeling of disconnection has led me to closing myself off again. I used to be ok with reaching out for help, but now I just put on a facade. I don't want people to know how lonely I am. the anxiety has gotten to the point where I can't respond to people for hours, even if I'm the one that initiated the conversation (a very rare occurrence). there's so much I want to do with the people around me, but I can't bring myself to interact with them. if I get a notification, I'm too scared to even look at my phone sometimes, fearing that it could be a friend. but on the other hand, if it's not a friend I'm left feeling disappointed and more lonely. see the problem here?

how can I get over this? I just wanna get out of my head but I can't. I want to do so much with my life to get out of this misery, but I keep seeming to self sabotage. it's tiring. maybe I'm just not meant to be connected to others",1658886641.0
936,"Cant accept my mistakes, and my past. I feel like I destroyed my chances for happiness.","I don't really know how to start, and I still did not figure out if Im the one to blame for this, or not.   
But let's start from the beggining.   
Im 26 yo. Last year due to my actions I lost My best friend, lover, and the person I felt the bigger bound in my life.   
I never had a lot of friends, and were mostly alone, and to be honest, I felt like I would never find a group of ppl that would understand me, and hangout with me.   
All of that changed 4 years ago, when I finally met some wonderfull ppl. And finally had my circle of friends. 

  
Among them was this one girl, that I fell love into. Unfortunately, she did not felt this way for me, and choosed someone else, even when her relationships did not worked out, she would find someone else, and never gave me a chance. And well I accepted that, there is no way to force someone to love someone. And I get it, never forced it or anything. That may hurt me, but i still supported her in any way I could, couse she also became my best friend. And I never had anyone so close to me in my entire life.

  
With time she started to send me some more provocative pictures, some suggestions etc. Even when she still were in relationship. I can't say Im into someone cheating, but for her... I could not stop myself, I wanted her so much... so i get along with it. There were a lot of different situations in our first year of friendship, kissing, petting, touching breasts etc. We were sleeping together from time to time (but just hugs, we did not have sex, at least not yet). Some time has past. 

Finally about 2 years ago, she proposed affair, I was not so sure about it, bcs she still had boyfriend, but Like before, I just could not let this go. I felt, like dissagreing to that would be something I would regret my whole life. So after 1.5 years of friendship, we had our first sex, and It felt great. She told me that it would just be sexsual, she won't dump her bf, or anything like that, so I had some distance to it. But with time I saw her slowly changing her mind, and asking me more intimate, relationship relatable questions like: How much children would I like to have, how do I imagine my future if she were with me. And I could not feel more overjoyed. This was something I dreamed about. I always wanted her to be so close to me, to ask me that. And it seemed, like eveything were going into the right direction.  


But suddently everything were done. There were just another night, we were about to spend together, we were talking to each other, I started to touching her, while still talking with her, we did not have sex this time, but some erotically touching. Next day she acted kinda weird on me. But nothing specially unusual. Only when she acted weird, for next 2-3 days, I finally asked her, is there everything fine between us. And only then I get to know, that she did not remember conversation we were having, and don't remember agreeing to anything. She accused me of sexsual harassment. I were honestly devastated. I was sure that everything I did, was with her knowledge and permission. I never wanted to dissapoint her, and never wanted to hurt her in any way.. She were the last person on earth that I would want to hurt in any way. Only thing I could do is to apologise to her, and try to explain. She accepted my apologies, in a way at least. But also said, that is all over. And I get that. If she felt that way, then I understand her decision.

That were year ago, i still feel like shit, i still miss her a lot, I wish I could just speak to her, but I cant. I really thought that she was the one, that she was love of my life. I still love her, I wish i could talk to her. By that stupid situation, i feel like I lost my biggest chance to be happy in my life. And all of that bcs of miscomunication, by misunderstanding... That went as bad as it could. I never imagined that it could go so wrong... If i knew that I would never accept this affair, I would decline. If not for that, situation like that would never happen. I always respected her space, and boundaries, even when we slept together, i never did anything more then she let me. Even when she were starting something, before we had an affair, like kissing me while she were drunk,  I were  the one stopping that, bcs I knew that sober her, would not want that... How could it end that badly?   


I just wished, that this relationship, no matter if it would be marriage, romance, friendship, etc, would last forever, for the lifetime.  And even if for some reason would it end, then that it would be something she would have good memories of... but now it is gone. And I bet she does not think of it in positive light, which is understandable. 

I feel like such a freaking loser, like I always menage to somehow fail the most important things in my life. 

I don't even know why im writing that, I don't know if I need someone to comfort me, or to judge me. I just want to be heard. All I ever wanted for her is her hapiness, and it ended in such an tragic way...

938,This is my road to be better.,"I have been struggling with basics( maintaining personal hygiene , eating and exercising regularly, drinking enough water, getting chores done) for quite a long period time. This never ending routine of demise ( me playing computer games in bed the WHOLE day and not even getting out to brush my teeth) really needs to change or else I might as well jump off a cliff. So I make this post to keep track of my days. I will be updating what I have done every day. I hope this will help push me to actually get things done.


I want to thank you for all the support! It motivates me to get up and do something! :D


Day 1: Anyway, I try to tidy up the desk today. 
To start, I focus on sitting on a chair instead of laying in bed. Then I drink some water to stay refreshed.
When I am tidying up my place, I get into sort of a spiral. I can't help but look at some photos when I was not depressed and happy about life, had actual hobbies like reading etc. Then I hate myself for falling into the pit and becoming the shit that I am now, which tries its best to escape from any kind of stress, and ends up being complete failure.
I managed to throw away a big bag of trash. But my living space is so full of shit (still got useless wrappers and books piling up) that it still looks like crap.  I fail at tidying up my desk. It's too hard.
I wash some clothes and dry them. I also finally take a shower and brush my teeth in the shower. I am very happy about it.
Then I lay in the bed and mindlessly scroll on my phone until I sleep.
 
Tomorrow, I want to take a walk outside, drink more water (at least 1.5L), keep tidying up my desk, shower and brush.

Day 2: Today really sucks. I take a long walk then I shower. After then I play computer games on bed for the whole day ... again. And also eat some junk food. Then I go to sleep... without brushing... I fail at brushing, drinking water and tidying. I think playing games is so addictive, as it provides me with some kind of social interactions. If I had used my time playing games on do small tasks instead, I would have gotten them done, and be happy with myself... For tomorrow, I don't know. Just shower and brush.

Day 3: I don't know anymore. Maybe that's why I will never get better. I am still stuck in bed. Can't do anything... At all",1654141066.0

she decided to take me off them. not wean me off— she made me get off them all in three days. then after three days she made me get on vraylar and seroquel

i experienced such bad withdrawal i was in hospital. the vraylar and seroquel gave me medication induced mania and psychosis. so those are two more medicines i had to cold turkey only a few days after going cold turkey on the others 

i’m still recovering. i’m currently on no medications. i’m angry at myself for trusting my NP. it should’ve been so obvious to me something was wrong— what professional would make me go cold turkey!

my family doctor is furious. she says that any medical professional should know better. if someone’s depressed and you yank them off all medications, it’ll get worse

my family doctor wants me back on wellbutrin 150MG. says it’ll help level out my brain again 

the thing is…i’m terrified. this whole experience has left me paranoid of even taking advil. i have a terrible cold and i won’t even take cold medicine. 

i was on wellbutrin for years! and i adored it! but i’m so fucking scared, guys. i can’t get over the paranoia. the meds have just been sitting on my counter and whenever i think of taking it i go into a panic attack

I have rewritten a few minor details here. I want to get some feedback if I could give them a letter like this! Warning: its pretty long


I will be going into inpatient psychiatric treatment over the Christmas vacations. I have traumas that I have never been able to get processed. I still have mother's words ringing in my head ""can't you just let it go?"". And unfortunately, I can't. And I'm not willing to pretend anymore just to keep you guys happy. It's about my mental health now. There is nothing calm in my life. There is no contentment. 

I have unimaginable complexes in my social life, no real friends, no hobbies and just feel emptiness. Where was my calmness when I got reproaches for sleeping too long/playing too much/doing too little/not having enough hobbies/playing Pokemon too long/not having eaten enough/not having eaten up too much/eating too fast/sitting wrongly/being awake too long/standing screaming in bed as a baby. Where was my peace then? Instead, I had to maneuver around you to keep your spirits from going down the drain. I remember countless fights with mother. You even sat at the dishwasher and cried during them. BECAUSE OF A CHILD. I WAS A CHILD. A CHILD THAT IS ACTUALLY INNOCENT. And I was constantly made into a perpetrator by you. 

I could never grow up liberated. And had no one to talk to about it. You should have been the adults with a balanced nervous system. Not me. You should have been my stable factor. Instead, all I remember is strife and emptiness. And now you feel this restlessness, this never feeling at ease, how it directly affects my life. I can't have happy interpersonal interactions. I can't feel anything for other people. Relationships I enter into so I don't feel quite so alone. And yet, I feel absolutely and 100% alone. I desperately need trauma therapy and finally your understanding that I can function but still never live up to the expectations you have of me. And I am so tired of always playing the contented son. I am insanely desperate in my life and don't know how to go on at all. My relationship is a disaster. I don't want to move in together and yet I haven't managed to break up for over 1 ½ years because I can't stand the thought of being alone. I am at a complete impasse. I have only learned what it means to function. 

I function great, professionally I get everything done that I need to. But I have never developed a stable character. That never worked out. I still have no real interests, I am never just happy. There is simply nothing in me except a yawning emptiness. Yes, you tried to give me hobbies. But instead of soccer you could have encouraged my hobby ""gambling"". Why did it always have to be things that were obviously not good for me? Why did I have to help dad build a house, when I was just being beaten up for not being able to do anything right? Why was I beaten up by you for not being able to paint anything? Why wasn't it encouraged that I liked to play. Why didn't we have a dog, some contact person? Why did I so rarely see my cousin? <Home> is only an hour away. Was the thought of an only child being emotionally stunted without anything to bond with really that far off? I can't understand your choices. 

Why was I even yelled at for things when I went downstairs without taking the fucking trash with me? Why was I always told the stories that at dinner with you still a book was put on the back and on the head while we ate? That has exactly the same effect on me! You have passed on the reproaches, which your parents have given to you 1/1 to me. No matter if the book was actually there or not. It does not depend on that! The reproach and the traumatization is the same! Why didn't you respect my boundaries and keep trying to push food into me that I didn't like? Why was my portion of food never just okay, it was always judged. Either it was too much, too little or eaten too fast. Why was I criticized for every action? Even the showers were too long! I could never please you. You completely incapacitated me and did not respect my limits. At the same time, you reacted so emotionally to my behavior, as if someone full-grown had said that to you. 

My childhood has been for me a single military drill operation, in which I had to carry out everything, down to the smallest hair, the way you want it. I always pretended that everything was fine so that you would be satisfied. It didn't matter if I was really fine or not. The main thing was that I didn't disappoint you or bring your mood down. Why did Mom get depressed when I threw down a bowl? I can still remember that. Why was there always the most extreme gossip about grandma and grandpa when we went home? What did I learn from that? Even if people are nice, behind their backs they always blaspheme. Other people are not like you. They don't blaspheme. I had to learn that for a really long time, not to always blaspheme about people when they are away. What kind of learning effect do you think that has on a child? And especially a child that doesn't learn about anything else from anywhere. 

That I had such a strong influence on your moods as a child is one of the greatest tragedies. Without this fact, everything would have been better. You treated me as an adult when I was a child and forgot that I am not yet able to reflect everything accurately. You did not perceive my emotional level at all. You should have been the stable ones; that was your responsibility as an adult. But I had to reflect as a child because you didn't give me a choice. And the only conclusion was that I was to blame for everything. Of course that's wrong, but as a child you can't reflect better, especially when you lack people (e.g. siblings, friends, other family, ...) to give you reference points. I can close my past (in theory). But that changes absolutely nothing about the psychological problems I have. I have an insanely unregulated nervous system. I have no support within myself. 

I feel no connection to other people. I have a poor memory. I can't visualize anything (but this is probably just a malformation from the brain). I always feel inferior for no reason. I always need positive feedback from outside when I do something. I do things only to be able to show them to others later. I can't even gamble anymore because I get a guilty conscience right away. I am constantly afraid, brooding everything to death, always painting everything negatively. I still have panic attacks, even if I have them better under control. I am practically incapable of living a life. I can't do anything except sports without feeling bad (without thinking about it, it just happens automatically). And I have to live with that. No matter if I tell myself the reasons for it, come from somewhere else, or I just had bad luck genetically. I'm sure you didn't mean any harm, quite the opposite. But unfortunately, in my upbringing, many things simply did not go as it would have been good for my healthy development. I can forgive you for that, but unfortunately I, and also you, have to live with the consequences. 


And even if I am imagining everything, then I am simply mentally ill for no reason. I function perfectly, but the important thing, that I can perceive a happy life as a human being, that is not there at all and never has been. I don't care how much of this you take seriously. Of course, there are certainly points that are exaggerated in my memory. And even if I am imagining all of this (which I am not), my illness is that I am imagining it. Any way you slice it, I need help. And I need to learn to set emotional boundaries. And one boundary is getting rid of this letter and instead of celebrating Christmas with you, going to a clinic for 3 weeks. Of course, my childhood may not have been as bad as yours. But you had siblings, uncles, aunts, etc. that you could talk to. I had nothing. And maybe your genetic default is just not quite as bad as mine. I've already seen 2 psychiatrists, tried anti-depressants (do nothing). I'm trying to get a spot with a trauma therapist now. And of course a child without a genetic disposition would probably have walked out of there normally. 

But since I also have a genetic predisposition to mental illness, unfortunately that was not the case. And to tell me now that all this was not so. Then why am I like this? Of course, I also experienced shit at school and in soccer and everywhere. But none of that would have happened if I hadn't been traumatized as a toddler. As a child, all I ever knew was fear every day. And that must have come from somewhere. Genetics + upbringing have certainly both played their part. So what is the consequence? I don't want you guys to be demanding about how I live my life. I want no more comments about things I do. No direct or even indirect accusations. No funny looks, no accusations that I don't open up enough, that I don't share anything about my life. None of that. No reproach when I don't have a relationship. And no reproach for how I break up, how quickly I find someone new, etc. And no reproach if I have nothing planned for my future. I just don't have any hobbies or (almost) any friends that I do things with on a regular basis. I don't want to receive any more evaluations from you guys. Because I feel all the reproaches to me. Every funny look, every undertone is perceived by me. I am so sensitized there, that I probably already imagine things. It is simply also sick in this respect. But that's how you made me. Always on ""high alert"". Warning level activated 100%. No possibility to switch off my warning system. Always afraid of having done something wrong. I definitely don't want to have children. 

I may never be able to have a happy healthy relationship. And you have to accept that without blaming me. How should you react to this? Of course, I know that this will hit you hard. After all, I am important to you. But don't forget that there are two of you. Talk to each other, not to me. I don't want to hear any counter-arguments or justifications of how normal it all was. I am aware that these things that happened are normal to a certain extent. And I know you guys made an effort and we did nice things too. But combined with my pre-existing genetic condition, it has now led to the outcome we have now. No amount of arguing back and forth can change that. 

Why am I saying this only when I am <years> old? Because I did not know it exactly before and also could not formulate it so well. In addition, I am now also financially independent and no longer have to worry about my future in this regard. Also, I've reached a breaking point where I'm doing so badly that I have to focus on myself now. Plus, I had always hoped that things would get better without me having to tell you guys anything. But I think without this, I can't heal. And I can't stand talking to you guys about it either. It would only make it worse. I don't want to talk to you about it. I want to prepare what I am saying here as an info for you, so to speak. This is not to be understood as a discussion-stimulating. It doesn't matter if things were as I perceived them. This is all history. Even if you see it 100% differently and would tell me 1000 other stories. I didn't make up my perception of childhood, I actually felt that way. Whether I felt that way because that's how it was, or because I'm fundamentally disturbed, doesn't change that at all. And therefore any discussion is also unnecessary. And would also cost me strength, which I do not have at the moment and cannot muster for it. 


You are two, I am alone. Clarify your view among yourselves but leave me out of it. I have no one on my side and therefore I am very weak. Nobody, really absolutely nobody, except maybe my cousin to a tiny percentage, can represent my point of view. I am absolutely alone in this. You can tell each other that you did everything perfectly for all I care. I don't care. I express herewith again quite clearly that I do not want an estimation on your part. And if I should get this nevertheless I see this only as crossing of my emotional border, which I describe herewith expressly and ask you to respect. I may be sick, but I am an adult and therefore I have a right that you respect my limits. Of course, I am sorry that it is so. And I also know that you have changed a lot from before. By now you would be different. But you couldn't be different then. So at least be the stable adults now and behave like healthy parents should behave.


 Accept my point of view, process it and don't let me feel your depression, annoyance, disappointment, hatred or anything else from it. Anything would lead to further retraumatization of me. I don't want a response to this. I don't want to know how you will react to this. I can imagine it well enough. I don't want a message, a call, a letter, a carrier pigeon, nothing. You should read this in peace and process it for yourselves. Talking to me is not necessary and would only be considered super awkward by me. The only response I could even accept to this would be a short apology via text that doesn't go into detail. I don't even want to know if you guys see things the same way I do. And I don't want to talk about it at the next meeting either. I don't want a ""meaningful"" hug, no weird forced eye contact, nothing. I would think everything sucks. Just accept this and be normal next time and without judging me. I demand that you guys work this out. There is no alternative. 


And if you can't, then seek your own therapeutic help. I am not your therapist. And if that is exhausting for you, then it is exhausting for you. The last XX years of my life have been insanely exhausting for me. And I will definitely have to go through more very exhausting years as well. But it's time for me to stand by my feelings and just be clear about what's going on. And if you find it unfair that I don't want a reaction, then that's just unfair. I also find a lot of things unfair. That is for my self-protection. And if you can't understand that, then you can't understand that. But then you still have to accept it as it is. 

PS: You don't always have to talk. I would find it super pleasant if we could just sit together at the table without talking and without this silence leading to funny looks, bad mood or anything else. It is quite normal to talk nothing and I find it just beastly exhausting and annoying if constantly words are thrown into space, only so that no silence prevails. It's better to talk less and then about interesting things. If you don't take the time to be quiet, you won't think of anything clever or interesting. Most of the time you just talk shit.


Addition: And I also don't want that the next time we see each other, your sadness is presented to me. That would be the worst thing you could do to me. and if that's not possible, then I'd rather not come at all. You must be able to control your emotions independently of me. And if you can't, then we have an unsolvable problem. you must have a huge desire for justification. but if you do, then you haven't understood this message yet. i know you would tell me things like ""yes but we sent you to friends"" etc.. But this is not about arguments and counter-arguments. I'm telling you dryly how I feel. Arguments for or against would not only be inappropriate, but also disrespectful, because they would again declare my assessment to be incorrect. And my feelings and perception you can not understand and have no right to evaluate that. The fact that I have to say this so explicitly should show you how much I am afraid of being attacked by you.",1636207751.0
942,Need help getting over my best friend,"We met roughly 9 years ago. Were really good friends for about 8 years of the 9.

And one thing lead to another and we figured we liked each other. 
He was the easiest person to be around and fall for. 
He was always understanding, always encouraging, always there for me, I could always go to him for anything. He was my best friend.

I have no friends (except like one that only texts me to talk about her bf and then ignores me) - but whenever I for a second try to put myself out there I end up IMMEDIATELY ghosting the other person b/c I'm too anxious so it's a horrible loop of knowing no one ever. I also pretty much feel like I don't exist. I'm trans, but my family (which I live with due to covid FUCK covid man) is so LGBT phobic that I'll never come out to anyone so I just feel nonexistent and stuck. It feels impossible to shower/brush teeth daily like I don't know what my deal is, but like what's the point, doing work just to be alone in my room all day until the end of time. Things don't interest me anymore, sometimes I just stare at things for periods of time because there's nothing else worth doing. I'm trying to get a job but I'm so anxious talking to people that I don't know if I really actually could, the only thing that opens me up is drinking (which I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm getting too familiar with binge drinking) which I do when I'm miserable but it just makes me more aware of my distaste of my situation. When I do leave the house (which is a special occasion each time) I'm just so SO anxious with people, I pretty much try to avoid everyone I see. When I do have to talk to someone I can only do so in whispers.   


When I was full-time in college, I was working on a physics degree which I LOVED because working day and night was a beautiful way to escape all of this that I'm feeling, but I wanted to take a break (aka switching to part time starting the fall) because I wanted to work on myself because I know that surrounding myself with only studies/work until the end of time isn't a way to live. But now I'm starting to think that it's probably the only way how to live. I'm a junior physics major with still a 4.0, so I know that studying tricky things is something that I can do, but it's probably the only thing that I can do. I can't understand people. I can't deal with being myself. I can't leave my house, let alone speak to anyone competently. It's starting to get to the point to where I can't even get out of bed.

But something recently happened and I think I'm finally breaking. I don't really like speaking about super personal stuff to strangers on the internet, but I just really want people to hear me out and possibly give me some advice, I guess.

For the sake of keeping everyone's identities secret, I'm gonna be using fake names. There's a **lot** of context to talk about, and this absolutely cannot be tl;dr'd. I'm sorry. So I'll try to summarize all of this as much as I possibly can.

But if you guys *really, really* need a tl;dr, the best I can say is...

""Best friend went through a lot. She's becoming a horrible person. I can't stand it anymore.""

Anyway.

Around 12 years back, I befriended somebody I'll call Patty. When I met her, she was in an abusive relationship with a rather lazy and irresponsible man. Patty also doesn't have a very good relationship with her family, as her parents had divorced a long while back, her father moving away and never speaking to her, and her stepfather being a very hateful man who loves his son, but doesn't care about either of his stepdaughters, claiming that a woman's baggage isn't his responsibility. The mother ""loves"" her daughters, but pretty much never steps up and defends them.

It took Patty a long time (like over a decade, around 6-7 years in the time I knew her) to finally break up with the man she was with, the last straw having been when the dude stole her medical money and used it to buy a PS3. I was frequently there to emotionally support her over the years, I paid for meals, I lent her money, and when she broke up with that man, I helped her through a fairly long coping process. It got to the point she began to straight up call me her ""big sister"" (even though I'm like 4 years younger than her), and I called her a sister back.

For a while, she was doing great. She was living independently, she was tackling issues with absolute confidence, and above all, she was kicking ass. I actually looked up to her. I live independently as well, but the way she faced things with a smile was so admirable. She wasn't the most book smart, but she knew her way around life.

Then she started to break. Slowly but surely. She began dating again, going through various quick relationships, and one night she sent me a long apology text and attempted suicide via overdose. Thankfully, another friend arrived on time to get Patty some medical attention.

She then started antidepressants. And for a while, things were looking up yet again. But then she started dating more guys. Again. And I even told her she shouldn't be doing this, and she agreed with me, but she just kept going, going through relationship after relationship, breakup after breakup, getting her heart broken, causing her to cry, me having to keep her company and comfort her, etc.

She also began to develop health problems (she's slowly going blind, and she's had a couple of tumors), which eventually resulted in her losing her job.

One day we started hanging out with a friend, who I'll call Fred. The two of them weren't dating or anything, he was just an extra friend to hang out with us on weekends and play video games with us. And for a while, everything was fine. But eventually Patty kept acting rather mean towards Fred. It started off small, with just some passive aggressive comments here and there, but it kept getting worse. She'd even talk smack about him behind his back to me.

Eventually, Patty began dating a Marine Captain who I'll call Bill. I was very nervous about it at first, but Bill turned out to be an absolutely fantastic dude. This man is honest, kind, hilarious, and so empathetic. Patty became absolutely *infatuated* with him, and I did not blame her one bit. Unfortunately, while he loves Patty and does want to be in a solid relationship with her... he does have relationship issues of his own, having recently gone through a divorce after his now-ex-wife cheated on him. And before *that,* he was in another troubled relationship. As a result, he's currently still very afraid of being in any serious relationships. But he does love the absolute hell out of Patty.

Later on, Patty had to leave her apartment because the landlord was kicking her out, and she had nowhere to stay. She ended up staying with Bill. However, it had to be a temporary thing, because in a year, Bill was gonna move to a different state and tackle college. The man really wants to become a history teacher. He gave up his dream once before with his ex-wife, but he wasn't gonna give it up for another relationship again. Patty was initially meant to stay for a month or two while she looked for another apartment.

... Thaaaaat didn't end up happening. She stayed the entire year. She had trouble finding apartments, especially ones that'd allow pets (she has two cats and a lizard). As the deadline drew closer, she got increasingly stressed and got to the point she was legitimately *crying in her sleep.* Meanwhile, Fred began dating a then-girl-now-gender-neutral who I'll call Gloria. Gloria was new in town, having just moved to this state, and they started hanging out with the gang. It didn't take long for Patty to begin talking smack about Fred behind his back towards Gloria, and Gloria was having none of it, so Patty quickly stopped. Gloria's tried to be friendly towards Patty, but the two really, really don't like each other much.

One night I got pretty upset. She got extremely drunk, acting unbelievably mean towards Fred, and I finally got up and sternly told her to give me the bottle. I dumped her alcohol down the sink, and she got upset and went to her bedroom to sulk for the rest of the night. Later, she had a miserable experience throwing up in the toilet for several hours.

The next day, I confronted her about her behavior and asked her why she's so rude towards Fred. Fred's a great dude, and I didn't understand what was going on. ... Turns out she really had no good reason. She kept giving me all these petty excuses, nitpicking little bits of his behavior. I was astonished. I told her that she needs to straighten her shit out, because I'm not gonna listen to this crap anymore. She and Fred soon got things talked out.

The last minute plan for Patty was that she'd stay with her family, and... hoo-boy, that's an entire story on its own. I won't go into it. To keep it very short, her stepdad is rich, her mom needs to stand up for her daughter, and after a lot of stubbornness, lies, and thin-veiled excuses, Patty was finally able to get a roof over her head on time for Bill to leave.

In the meantime, Fred and Gloria got their own house. However, for a combination of legal reasons... and reasons regarding their own sanity (can't blame them)... they couldn't let Patty stay with them. I couldn't let her stay with me because of her cats. I have cats as well, and mine are declawed (not my decision, I adopted them like that), while hers aren't. They would not get along, and it wouldn't be fair on any of the animals.

To say things got so much worse would be an understatement. I've met her stepdad personally, and he really isn't a good dude. Things kept escalating, and he got increasingly abusive, cutting off her internet, constantly talking down on her, etc. And Patty got increasingly depressed. What also didn't help was that she was having trouble getting disability (again, she's slowly going blind).

Things further weren't helped by the fact that last year, I ended up getting shingles....... at the age of 30. *In the middle of a pandemic.* I got extremely depressed myself and suicidal, nearly starving myself. I got started on antidepressants myself, and that's when I found out...

... Ever since Patty started dating Bill, **she straight up just stopped taking her antidepressants.** Cold turkey. Because she thought she was ""too strong"" for them. I just... ASDFGHJ. PATTY. WHAT. Not even Bill had any idea, so I told him.

Bill moved, and Patty got more and more depressed (with the antidepressants not helping her anymore due to the chemicals in her brain being all frizzled up). Fred, Gloria, and I were doing everything we could to stay in contact with her. We always invited her over to hang out with us, we always texted her to check up on how she was doing, we always gave her the assurance that she can come over to our places whenever she needs to get out of that house. But nothing. She always ignored us. Then one day... something happened.

She sent me a semi-vague message indicating she was gonna commit suicide.

She sent me a message, I panicked, I tried to contact her multiple times, and I got no answer. I was in tears. I told Bill, Fred, and Gloria about it. I said I was gonna rush to her parents' home. Gloria joined me, bringing some first aid stuff, and Fred was on standby to call 911. We rushed over there, and Patty's mom said that Patty had left somewhere. No idea where. I tried to contact Patty some more. Nothing. I am hyperventilating at this point. Finally she answers me.

It was fake. She wasn't actually going to commit suicide. And she had the audacity to try telling me we were doing nothing to help her. We apparently ""hated"" her and were always ""ignoring"" her.

... What.

To say I tore her a new one would be an understatement. She cried. I didn't care. I was emotionally devastated and stressed to the point I was dehydrated and seeing colors. And it wasn't helped by the fact I was recently suicidal like... just two months ago. I didn't need this shit. What the hell is her problem?

I get it. Depression warps your mind. I've suffered from depression since I was like 11. I've attempted suicide three times in my life.

But this *infuriated* me.

A week later, Bill visited in person, and we all got things talked out. I was ready to break up the friendship, but I gave Patty another chance, telling her to never do anything like that ever again. Our friendship was on thin ice for a while, but eventually the foundation started to rebuild. She was visiting us more, she was opening up to us more, we were helping her through things, etc. She even got started on some new antidepressants, and they were helping her a bit.

That said, she was starting to act a bit disrespectful towards Fred & Gloria again. Nothing extreme, but you could tell she just really didn't like these guys *unless* they were actively helping her with stuff.

Then I heard the news that she's gonna move away to be with Bill this August. Bill apparently finally got fed up with Patty's abusive stepdad, so he made arrangements for her to live with him. Hey, that's cool. Fred and Gloria even began considering letting Patty stay with them until August. Even I considered letting her stay with me, if things absolutely had to reach that point.

... Theeeeen more discoveries were made. Last Saturday, Patty was super depressed, and she spoke to Fred & Gloria in private. Fred & Gloria brought up the possibility of letting her stay with them, and Patty said, ""Bill suggested I ask you that, but I didn't wanna be a burden."" She also said that she's not looking for any apartments or jobs at this point, because she's moving so soon.

Fred & Gloria then spoke to Bill over video chat, and it was discovered that for starters, Bill was surprised we knew about the whole August thing. He also never suggested that she stay with Fred & Gloria. On top of this, the August thing was only a last resort sort of deal in case she couldn't find an apartment and job. He's gonna be moving around a lot due to his job as well as college, and he'd rather not have to lug Patty and her pets around, because that'd be rough on everyone.

We informed Bill of what's been going on, because he deserves to know. Bill was clearly so stressed. We felt awful for the dude. He's been doing a lot to help Patty, but he looked like he aged like 10 years due to trying to help Patty from afar (chatting with her daily and giving her advice and such). He said she practically needs to be babysat, because whenever the *slightest roadblock* stops her, she just quits.

... I wanna be cautiously optimistic, guys. I want to believe there's just some misunderstanding going on. But Fred, Gloria, and I are gonna be speaking to Patty extremely soon. But if she's pulling some strings and essentially trying to *lie* and emotionally manipulate us into helping her with things...

... I dunno. I'm probably gonna tap out... because I can't take this anymore. I know. Depression. She's in a bad situation and she's desperate to get out of it. I know. But I still absolutely despise the person this woman has become. She's not Patty anymore. She's someone else I don't recognize. She's a whiny, self-entitled idiot who's willing to fake suicide threats in order to get attention. She refuses to be forward with us. Her personality is ugly and I can't stand it anymore. Bill still loves this girl, but a part of me is now thinking, ""I don't know what he sees in her.""

I have dedicated so much of my time and energy towards helping her, even though I suffer from fairly severe depression myself. I don't want to break up this friendship. I'm scared of breaking this up. I'm also scared I *won't* break this up.

I'm scared she really will attempt suicide again if this happens. We've been through so much together and I'm practically the only shoulder she has here that she actively wants to lean on. I know that I'm not responsible for another person's toxic traits, but I'd still be haunted if something like that happened.

I feel like a terrible person. I probably *am* a terrible person. I don't know what to think anymore. She's been one of my best friends for 12 years and I want it all to have been worth it, and I'm scared. I want it to go on, and yet I don't. Occasionally I find myself just crying and whimpering to myself because I *don't know what to do.* She doesn't take any advice I give her (I've suggested getting proper professional help), and yet she relies on me a lot when she needs to emotionally vent. I'm one of the few reasons she's even remotely sane at this point. I ultimately feel trapped in this situation. She needs help, and she sortakinda semi-accepts help, but then she does more to screw herself over.

This latest situation had better just be some misunderstanding, because if it's not, I simply cannot freaking take this anymore. I just can't.

And if this *is* a misunderstanding, I already know she's gonna emotionally **freak** upon the discovery she probably won't be able to leave in August, and who knows what'll happen from there, considering her track record thus far. This is such an upcoming lose-lose situation.

I'm so sorry this post was so long. If you actually read all this, thank you for reading my sob story.

Seriously, just... thank you for your time. Thank you. The talk with her is gonna occur in about 12 hours or so. I'd appreciate *any* advice. Please.",1619875783.0
946,Happiness can feel like it's outside our control - but you have more influence than you realise,"The four noble truths of the Buddha are simple to express: suffering is part of life, but happiness is possible and we make choices in every moment that lead us to happiness / suffering. The reason its revolutionary is that it paints a picture where our happiness isn’t an external factor that's outside of our control, it’s something that’s within our reach with some practice, some patience and some persistence.

Which is not to say that you should beat yourself up for not being happy - its as important to practice non-judgement for yourself as for others, because every person you see if doing the best they can given their circumstances, including you.

So how do we train ourselves to be happy? The first step is to focus on the positive.  This might not be where our minds go automatically - humans have a natural negativity bias, a leftover from our our evolution where we’re more focused on where there might be wolves than where there’s flowers. This is completely understandable as it kept us alive for thousands of years but its something we need to be aware of when living our modern lives. Social media is very focused on the negative because that’s what grabs our attention. Research shows that consuming any kind of media that is mostly negative affects our mental health. So we need to be careful what we consume.

We can also make a choice in every moment to focus on the good things we have and be grateful for them rather than seeing what we don’t have or what’s wrong. This takes time and patience as we might be very used to focusing on the negative. I live in Britain and we love to have a moan, especially about the weather but it’s within our gift to appreciate the great things that are all around and regularly meditate on them or capture them in a gratitude journal. On the flip side can notice our judgmental thoughts arise, listen to them without getting involved or judging and watch them pass without acting on them. This is how we train ourselves to focus on the positive.

The second step is smiling to your difficulties. This sounds absolutely crazy - why would you want to smile when things are difficult? There's two reasons - the first is neurological. When you smile, even if you don’;t feel like smiling, your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and lift your mood - so its a very easy way to change how you’re feeling. That's why we gently smile while we meditate.

The other way smiling helps is that it reduces the power those difficulties have over you in your mind. When we see anger, anxiety and sadness as our enemies that rob us of our peace then (naturally) we’re afraid of them - we try and block out the thoughts and we run to consumption to help us out, which of course never works in the long term. When we smile to our difficulties, our difficult emotions and say, “there you are, my old friend”, we accept what we’re feeling without judgement, we reduce our suffering.

947,Seven key attitudes for a happy life according to Jon Kabat Zinn,"**Non-judgment** - paying attention to your opinions as they arise. JKZ talks about how the human mind sorts things into boxes - good, bad, neutral. By taking a perspective of non-judgement and being aware we can take the most joy from the good things, accept the bad things (doing us less harm), and become more aware of the neutral things, realising how much they contribute to our lives. Of course judgmental thoughts still arise but we can simply observe them and let them pass without acting on them.


**Patience** - letting things unfold in their own time. Meditation isn’t difficult to learn but it does require patience and persistence. It takes some time to see the benefits of it, you need to stick with it. Doing it once a week is helpful but when you make time for a little bit of practice every day for six weeks the evidence shows its actually rewiring how your brain works, you’re training yourself to be happy. Its also about being patience with ourselves, not setting expectations for achieving a standard in a specific time, and being patient with others who have lived their life through a set of circumstances we’re not aware of. 


**Beginners mind** - seeing the world as if for the first time and seeing the infinite possibilities. Knowledge can limit our perception of what we don’t know, part of becoming wise (rather than clever) is getting comfortable with what we don’t know. When we accumulate a lot of knowledge and become jaded by experience we can lose touch with the joy in our lives.


**Trust** - listening to our bodies and our senses. Trusting that if we let go of anxieties about the future and regrets from the past and live in the present that everything will be OK - because it really will. When we cultivate trust in ourselves through practice, when we build our calmness and peace and live in the present moment  we start to trust other people more because we’re not jumping ahead to what they might do or questioning their motives - we’re existing in the present taking their words and actions at face value. Really listening to other people with an open mind is when we make strong human connections. 


**Non-striving** - we’re always trying to get somewhere, always running toward a destination. But an important aspect of mindfulness is realising that you have arrived in the here and now. We can’t live happily in the future; if everything we’re doing is to achieve, we sacrifice our wellbeing in the present. We tell ourselves we’ll be happy when we get promoted, we get married, we have kids, when we retire. This is the only time we can be happy - mindfulness is called the art of stopping, sometimes we have to ease off with the future plans and enjoy where we are and who we’re with.


**Acceptance** - accepting that things are the way they are. Which is not to say you don’t do anything about it, the idea is that you are aware in the present moment, you see things as they are and you can decide what it is you want to do. There’s a myth that mindfulness somehow makes you OK with injustice and suffering - the opposite is true! When we accept the world in front of us, accept people, accept yourself, you can act out of emotional intelligence and compassion rather than anger or fear. 


**Letting go** - by identifying the attachments we have we can trace the roots of our anger, our fear, our sadness and understand why we react the way we do in certain circumstances. Once we apply our awareness to our attachments we can start to understand ourselves, we can start to feel compassion for ourselves, then we can start to let go of our suffering.
